Sir William and Lady Lucas are definitely going just for that reason; as you know, they generally don't visit newcomers. You really must go, because it will be impossible for the rest of us to visit him if you don't make the initial call. You are being overly cautious, surely. I'm sure Mr. Bingley will be delighted to meet you, and I'll send a short note with you to confirm my complete approval of him marrying whichever of the girls he chooses – although I must add a favourable mention for my little Lizzy.

The news came out in this way: Mr. Bennet saw his second daughter, Elizabeth, working on decorating a hat and suddenly said to her, \"I hope Mr. Bingley will like that, Lizzy.\" Her mother responded with annoyance, \"We have no way of knowing what Mr. Bingley likes, since we aren't going to visit him.\" Elizabeth reminded her, \"But you're forgetting, Mamma, that we'll meet him at the dances, and Mrs. Long has promised to introduce him.\" \"I don't believe Mrs. Long will do anything of the sort,\" her mother retorted. \"She has her own two nieces. She is a selfish, dishonest woman, and I have no respect for her.\" \"Neither do I,\" said Mr. Bennet, \"and I'm relieved to see that you aren't depending on her help.\" Mrs. Bennet chose not to reply but, unable to control her frustration, started criticizing one of her other daughters. \"Stop coughing like that, Kitty, for heaven's sake! Show some consideration for my nerves. You are destroying them.\" \"Kitty's coughing shows poor judgment,\" her father commented; \"she picks the wrong times.\" \"I'm not coughing for fun,\" Kitty replied grumpily. \"When is the next ball, Lizzy?\" \"In two weeks.\" \"Oh yes, that's right,\" her mother exclaimed, \"and Mrs. Long doesn't return until the day before; so, it will be impossible for her to introduce him, because she won't even know him herself.\" Mr. Bennet then suggested, \"In that case, my dear, you could seize the opportunity instead of your friend and introduce Mr. Bingley to *her*.\" Mrs. Bennet found this preposterous, saying, \"Impossible, Mr. Bennet, impossible, when I myself don't know him; why are you being so annoying?\" \"I admire your caution,\" he said. \"Meeting someone for only two weeks is certainly very little time. You can't truly know a person after just a fortnight. But if *we* don't take the initiative, someone else will. And after all, Mrs. Long and her nieces will have their chance regardless; therefore, since she might see it as a kindness if you decline the task, *I* will take it upon myself.\"",

The matter came to light when he saw his second daughter, Elizabeth, decorating a hat, and he abruptly said to her, \"I hope Mr. Bingley will like it, Lizzy.\" Mrs. Bennet replied irritably that they couldn't know Mr. Bingley's tastes since they weren't going to visit him. Elizabeth reminded her mother that they would meet Mr. Bingley at social gatherings, and that Mrs. Long had offered to introduce them. Mrs. Bennet doubted Mrs. Long's sincerity, calling her selfish and hypocritical, with Mr. Bennet agreeing and remarking that it's good she doesn't rely on Mrs. Long. Mrs. Bennet ignored his comment and started scolding Kitty for coughing, claiming it hurt her nerves, while Mr. Bennet joked about Kitty's lack of timing. Kitty protested, asking Lizzy about the date of the next ball, and Lizzy said it was in two weeks. Mrs. Bennet pointed out that Mrs. Long wouldn't be back until the day before and thus couldn't introduce Mr. Bingley because she wouldn't know him yet. Mr. Bennet then teased that Mrs. Bennet could introduce him herself, but she protested, saying she wasn't acquainted with Mr. Bingley. He responded sarcastically, praising her caution and saying that after all, if they didn't take the opportunity to get to know Mr. Bingley, someone else would, and maybe Mrs. Long’s nieces would benefit. Still, since Mrs. Long might appreciate being spared the trouble, Mr. Bennet offered to do the introduction himself."

He could not help seeing that you were about five times as pretty as every other woman in the room. No thanks to his gallantry for that. Well, he certainly is very agreeable, and I give you leave to like him. You have liked many a stupider person.”\n“Dear Lizzy!”\n“Oh, you are a great deal too apt, you know, to like people in general. You never see a fault in anybody. All the world are good and agreeable in your eyes. I never heard you speak ill of a human being in my life.”\n“I would wish not to be hasty in censuring anyone; but I always speak what I think.”\n“I know you do: and it is that which makes the wonder. With your good sense, to be so honestly blind to the follies and nonsense of others! Affectation of candour is common enough; one meets with it everywhere. But to be candid without ostentation or design,—to take the good of everybody’s character and make it still better, and say nothing of the bad,—belongs to you alone. And so, you like this man’s sisters, too, do you? Their manners are not equal to his.”",

So much natural ease combined with perfect good breeding!\" Elizabeth responded, \"He is also attractive, which is another quality a young man should possess if possible. It completes his character.\" Jane remarked, \"I was very flattered by his asking me to dance a second time. I hadn't expected such a compliment.\" \"You didn't?\" Elizabeth countered, \"I certainly did for you. But that illustrates a major difference between us. Compliments always catch you by surprise, while I am never surprised. What could be more obvious than his asking you again? He couldn't help but see you were about five times more beautiful than every other woman present. No credit to his gallantry for noticing that. Well, he is undeniably agreeable, and I permit you to like him. You've liked many less deserving people.\" \"Oh, Lizzy!\" Jane exclaimed gently. Elizabeth continued, \"Oh, you are much too prone, you know, to like people in general. You never perceive a flaw in anyone. Everyone in the world is good and pleasant in your view. I have literally never heard you speak negatively about another human being.\" Jane replied, \"I prefer not to be hasty in criticizing anyone; however, I always state what I believe.\" \"I know you do,\" Elizabeth agreed, \"and that is precisely what is astonishing. With your good judgment, to be so genuinely oblivious to the follies and silliness of others! Pretending to be sincere is quite common; you encounter it everywhere. But to be truly sincere without any display or hidden agenda—to focus on the good in everyone's character and even enhance it, while saying nothing about the bad—that trait belongs uniquely to you.

That completes his character.\"\n\n\"I felt truly honored that he asked me to dance a second time. I really didn’t expect him to pay me such a compliment.\"\n\n\"Didn’t you? I did. That’s a big difference between us. Compliments always catch you off guard, but never me. What could be more natural than his asking you again? He must have noticed you were at least five times prettier than any other lady present. That’s no credit to his courtesy. Well, he’s certainly very pleasant, and I give you permission to admire him. You’ve admired people far less deserving.\"\n\n\"Oh, Lizzy!\"\n\n\"Truly, you are far too ready, you know, to like people. You never see faults in anyone. To you, everyone in the world is good and pleasant. I’ve never heard you say a bad word about anybody.\"\n\n\"I’d never want to be quick to judge anyone harshly; but I always say what I really believe.\"\n\n\"I know you do, and that’s what’s so remarkable. With all your good sense, you are so sincerely blind to others’ flaws! People often pretend to be this candid, it’s nothing rare.

They were, in fact, very fine ladies; not deficient in good-humour when they were pleased, nor in the power of being agreeable where they chose it; but proud and conceited. They were rather handsome; had been educated in one of the first private seminaries in town; had a fortune of twenty thousand pounds; were in the habit of spending more than they ought, and of associating with people of rank; and were, therefore, in every respect entitled to think well of themselves and meanly of others.

They were somewhat attractive, had been educated at one of the most prestigious private schools in London, possessed a fortune of twenty thousand pounds, were prone to overspending, and associated with people of high social standing. As such, they considered themselves fully justified in thinking highly of themselves and poorly of everyone else. Their family originated from a respectable part of northern England, a fact they remembered more distinctly than their brother's and their own wealth having been accumulated through trade.

The ladies were undoubtedly fashionable and could be pleasant when they wished, but they were also proud and self-important. They were attractive, had been educated at one of the top private schools in London, possessed fortunes of twenty thousand pounds, spent beyond their means, and socialized with aristocrats. So, they had every reason to think highly of themselves and look down on others.

Bingley declared that he had never met such agreeable people or seen more attractive young women. He found everyone remarkably kind and welcoming, felt at ease quickly, and was especially taken with Miss Bennet, considering her more beautiful than any angel. Darcy, by contrast, thought the people lacked beauty and sophistication, took no interest in any of them, and found no enjoyment or courtesy extended to him. He did admit Miss Bennet was attractive, but thought she smiled excessively. Mrs. Hurst and her sister agreed somewhat with Darcy, yet still found Miss Bennet charming, liked her, and declared her to be a delightful girl whom they would be glad to know better. As a result, Miss Bennet gained the reputation of being a sweet girl, and with his sisters' approval, Bingley felt free to think of her as he pleased."

Sir William Lucas had been formerly in trade in Meryton, where he had made a tolerable fortune, and risen to the honour of knighthood by an address to the king during his mayoralty. The distinction had, perhaps, been felt too strongly. It had given him a disgust to his business and to his residence in a small market town; and, quitting them both, he had removed with his family to a house about a mile from Meryton, denominated from that period Lucas Lodge; where he could think with pleasure of his own importance, and, unshackled by business, occupy himself solely in being civil to all the world. For, though elated by his rank, it did not render him supercilious; on the contrary, he was all attention to everybody. By nature inoffensive, friendly, and obliging, his presentation at St. James’s had made him courteous.\nLady Lucas was a very good kind of woman, not too clever to be a valuable neighbour to Mrs. Bennet.

Sir William Lucas had previously been involved in trade in Meryton, where he had earned a decent amount of money, and achieved the rank of knighthood by making an address to the king while he was mayor. This distinction may have been felt quite strongly. It led him to feel a dislike for his business and his residence in a small market town. Leaving both behind, he relocated with his family to a house approximately a mile from Meryton, named Lucas Lodge from that point forward. There, he could contemplate his own significance with pleasure and, free from the demands of work, dedicate himself solely to being polite and agreeable to everyone. For, although pleased by his elevated rank, it did not make him arrogant; instead, he paid attention to everyone. Naturally inoffensive, friendly, and helpful, his formal presentation at St. James's court had made him more courteous. Lady Lucas was a very kind sort of woman, not too intellectually sharp to prevent her from being a valuable neighbour to Mrs. Bennet. They had multiple children. The oldest, a sensible, intelligent young woman aged around twenty-seven, was Elizabeth’s closest friend.",

This new status affected him deeply—it made him discontented with both his business and living in the small town. As a result, he left both behind and moved his family to a house about a mile from Meryton, which came to be called Lucas Lodge. There, free from work, he could enjoy his elevated status and devote himself to being polite to everyone. Despite his pride in his title, Sir William was not arrogant—he was attentive, gentle, and eager to please, and his introduction at court had only increased his civility. Lady Lucas was a kindly woman and a good neighbor to Mrs. Bennet, without being overly clever. The Lucases had several children, the eldest of whom was a wise and intelligent young woman of about twenty-seven, and she was Elizabeth’s closest friend."

Miss Bennet’s pleasing manners grew on the good-will of Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley; and though the mother was found to be intolerable, and the younger sisters not worth speaking to, a wish of being better acquainted with them was expressed towards the two eldest. By Jane this attention was received with the greatest pleasure; but Elizabeth still saw superciliousness in their treatment of everybody, hardly excepting even her sister, and could not like them; though their kindness to Jane, such as it was, had a value, as arising, in all probability, from the influence of their brother’s admiration. It was generally evident, whenever they met, that he did admire her; and to her it was equally evident that Jane was yielding to the preference which she had begun to entertain for him from the first, and was in a way to be very much in love; but she considered with pleasure that it was not likely to be discovered by the world in general, since Jane united with great strength of feeling, a composure of temper and an uniform cheerfulness of manner, which would guard her from the suspicions of the impertinent. She mentioned this to her friend, Miss Lucas.\n“It may, perhaps, be pleasant,” replied Charlotte, “to be able to impose on the public in such a case; but it is sometimes a disadvantage to be so very guarded. If a woman conceals her affection with the same skill from the object of it, she may lose the opportunity of fixing him; and it will then be but poor consolation to believe the world equally in the dark. There is so much of gratitude or vanity in almost every attachment, that it is not safe to leave any to itself. We can all begin freely—a slight preference is natural enough; but there are very few of us who have heart enough to be really in love without encouragement. In nine cases out of ten, a woman had better show more affection than she feels. Bingley likes your sister undoubtedly; but he may never do more than like her, if she does not help him on.”\n“But she does help him on, as much as her nature will allow. If I can perceive her regard for him, he must be a simpleton indeed not to discover it too.”\n“Remember, Eliza, that he does not know Jane’s disposition as you do.”\n“But if a woman is partial to a man, and does not endeavor to conceal it, he must find it out.”\n“Perhaps he must, if he sees enough of her. But though Bingley and Jane meet tolerably often, it is never for many hours together; and as they always see each other in large mixed parties, it is impossible that every moment should be employed in conversing together. Jane should therefore make the most of every half hour in which she can command his attention. When she is secure of him, there will be leisure for falling in love as much as she chooses.”\n“Your plan is a good one,” replied Elizabeth, “where nothing is in question but the desire of being well married; and if I were determined to get a rich husband, or any husband, I dare say I should adopt it. But these are not Jane’s feelings; she is not acting by design. As yet she cannot even be certain of the degree of her own regard, nor of its reasonableness. She has known him only a fortnight. She danced four dances with him at Meryton; she saw him one morning at his own house, and has since dined in company with him four times. This is not quite enough to make her understand his character.”\n“Not as you represent it. Had she merely dined with him, she might only have discovered whether he had a good appetite; but you must remember that four evenings have been also spent together—and four evenings may do a great deal.”\n“Yes: these four evenings have enabled them to ascertain that they both like Vingt-un better than Commerce, but with respect to any other leading characteristic, I do not imagine that much has been unfolded.”\n“Well,” said Charlotte, “I wish Jane success with all my heart; and if she were married to him to-morrow, I should think she had as good a chance of happiness as if she were to be studying his character for a twelvemonth. Happiness in marriage is entirely a matter of chance. If the dispositions of the parties are ever so well known to each other, or ever so similar beforehand, it does not advance their felicity in the least. They always continue to grow sufficiently unlike afterwards to have their share of vexation; and it is better to know as little as possible of the defects of the person with whom you are to pass your life.”\n“You make me laugh, Charlotte; but it is not sound. You know it is not sound, and that you would never act in this way yourself.”",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "The women from Longbourn soon paid a visit to the women staying at Netherfield. The visit was formally returned. Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley developed a liking for Miss Bennet's pleasant demeanor, and although they found her mother unbearable and her younger sisters insignificant, they expressed a desire to become better acquainted with the two eldest daughters. Jane was very pleased by this attention, but Elizabeth still perceived arrogance in how they treated everyone, including almost her sister, and she couldn't like them. However, she valued their kindness to Jane, such as it was, likely understanding it stemmed from their brother's admiration. It was clear whenever they met that Mr. Bingley admired Jane. Elizabeth also clearly saw that Jane was receptive to the liking she had developed for him from the start and was quickly falling deeply in love. However, Elizabeth was glad that Jane's feelings probably wouldn't be obvious to others because Jane's strong emotions were combined with a calm temperament and consistently cheerful manner, which would protect her from prying eyes. She discussed this with her friend, Miss Lucas.\n\nCharlotte replied, \"It might be convenient to be able to deceive the public in such a situation, but being so reserved can sometimes be a disadvantage. If a woman hides her affection from the man she likes with the same skill, she might miss her chance to secure him. Then, it will be little comfort to know that others are also unaware. Most attractions involve so much gratitude or self-importance that it's risky to let things develop naturally. We can all begin easily—a slight preference is quite normal—but very few of us are brave enough to truly fall in love without some encouragement. In most cases, a woman should show more affection than she actually feels. Bingley definitely likes your sister, but he might never go beyond just liking her if she doesn't help him along.\"\n\nElizabeth responded, \"But she is helping him along, as much as her nature allows. If I can see how much she likes him, he would have to be very simple not to notice it too.\"\n\n\"Remember, Eliza,\" Charlotte said, \"that he doesn't understand Jane's personality like you do.\"\n\n\"But if a woman is attracted to a man and isn't trying to hide it, he must figure it out,\" Elizabeth insisted.\n\nCharlotte conceded, \"Perhaps he must, if he spends enough time with her. But even though Bingley and Jane meet fairly often, it's never for many hours continuously. And since they always see each other in large mixed groups, it's impossible for them to spend every moment talking to each other. Therefore, Jane should make the most of every brief period she can get his attention. Once she is sure of him, she will have plenty of time to fall in love as much as she wishes.\"\n\n\"Your strategy is suitable,\" Elizabeth replied, \"when the only goal is to make a good marriage. And if I were determined to marry a wealthy man, or any husband for that matter, I'm sure I would adopt it. But these aren't Jane's feelings; she isn't planning strategically. She isn't even certain yet how strong her feelings are, or whether they are reasonable. She has known him only two weeks. She danced four times with him at Meryton, saw him one morning at his house, and has dined with him in company four times since. This isn't really enough time for her to understand his character.\"\n\n\"Not if you describe it that way,\" Charlotte countered. \"If she had only dined with him, she might only have learned if he had a good appetite. But you must remember they have also spent four evenings together—and four evenings can reveal a great deal.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" Elizabeth said, \"those four evenings have allowed them to confirm they both prefer Vingt-un to Commerce, but as for any other significant character trait, I don't think much has been revealed.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Charlotte, \"I sincerely wish Jane success. And if she were married to him tomorrow, I would think she had just as good a chance of happiness as if she were to study his character for a year. Happiness in marriage is purely a matter of chance. No matter how well people know each other's personalities beforehand, or how similar they are, it doesn't increase their happiness at all. They always grow different enough afterward to have their share of troubles. It's better to know as little as possible about the flaws of the person you will spend your life with.\"\n\nElizabeth laughed. \"You make me laugh, Charlotte, but that's not true. You know it's not true, and you would never act that way yourself.\"",

Jane Bennet’s pleasant behavior was increasingly appreciated by Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley. Despite finding Mrs. Bennet unbearable and the younger Bennet sisters uninteresting, they expressed a desire to become better acquainted with Jane and Elizabeth. Jane felt delighted by this attention, but Elizabeth still sensed arrogance in their treatment of others, even Jane at times, and could not warm to them, though she valued their civility to Jane as probably motivated by their brother’s interest. It was quite clear whenever they met that Bingley admired Jane, and just as clear that Jane was developing a strong affection for him—though, thankfully, Jane’s calm temperament and consistent cheerfulness would likely prevent anyone from noticing her feelings. Elizabeth shared these thoughts with her friend Charlotte Lucas.\n\nCharlotte replied that hiding one’s feelings from the public might be pleasant, but cautioned it can be a disadvantage if a woman hides her affection even from the man she loves, potentially missing her chance to secure him—and no comfort can be found in knowing the rest of the world is equally oblivious. People rarely fall deeply in love without encouragement and, in most cases, a woman might be wiser to show more affection than she truly feels. Bingley obviously likes Jane, but may never go further if Jane doesn’t encourage him.\n\nElizabeth responded that Jane helps Bingley as much as her reserved nature allows; and if Elizabeth could perceive Jane’s feelings, surely Bingley would too. But Charlotte reminded her that Bingley does not know Jane as well as Elizabeth does. If a woman is fond of a man and does not hide it, he must eventually notice, Elizabeth argued. Charlotte conceded this might be the case if he spends enough time with her, but pointed out that Jane and Bingley only see each other at large gatherings and not for extended periods alone. Therefore, Jane should make the most of the time she gets with him. Once she’s won him, there will be plenty of time to fall in love at leisure.\n\nElizabeth replied that this strategy might work if a woman’s sole aim is to make a good marriage, but Jane was not being calculating; she could not even be sure of her own feelings yet, as she had known Bingley only two weeks and had only met him a handful of times. Charlotte countered that four evenings together can mean a lot in such situations. Elizabeth joked that all the couple might have discovered is that they both prefer the card game Vingt-un over Commerce, and little else about one another’s character.\n\nCharlotte wished Jane well, noting that she would think Jane had as much chance for happiness marrying Bingley now as if she took a year to study his character—since happiness in marriage depends mainly on luck. Even when couples seem well-suited or know each other thoroughly, they still end up with differences and irritations; therefore, it’s better to know as little as possible about a future spouse’s faults. Elizabeth laughed, telling Charlotte the idea wasn’t sound, and that she herself would never actually behave like that."

After completing a long piece, Mary was happy to gain compliments by playing lively Scottish and Irish tunes when requested by her younger sisters. Her sisters, along with some of the Lucases and a few officers, enthusiastically began dancing at one end of the room. Mr. Darcy stood nearby, quietly annoyed by this evening's activities, which prevented any conversation.

After she had sung a song or two, and before she could respond to the encouragement of several people wanting her to sing again, her sister Mary eagerly took her place at the instrument. Being considered the less attractive in the family, Mary had worked hard to acquire knowledge and talents, and was always keen to show them off. However, Mary lacked true talent and refinement; though her vanity motivated her, it also made her come across as overly studious and self-important, traits that would have undermined an even higher level of skill than she had. In contrast, Elizabeth’s natural and effortless manner made her performance more enjoyable, even if she did not play as well. When Mary finished playing a lengthy concerto, she was happy to earn some praise by playing Scottish and Irish tunes, as requested by her younger sisters. These sisters, along with some of the Lucases and a few officers, eagerly began dancing at one end of the room. Meanwhile, Mr. Darcy watched close by, silently disapproving of spending the evening this way, since it prevented conversation, and was so lost in his own thoughts that he did not notice Sir William Lucas was next to him, until Sir William spoke."

Do you often dance at St. James’s?”\n“Never, sir.”\n“Do you not think it would be a proper compliment to the place?”\n“It is a compliment which I never pay to any place if I can avoid it.”\n“You have a house in town, I conclude?”\nMr. Darcy bowed.\n“I had once some thoughts of fixing in town myself, for I am fond of superior society; but I did not feel quite certain that the air of London would agree with Lady Lucas.”\nHe paused in hopes of an answer: but his companion was not disposed to make any; and Elizabeth at that instant moving towards them, he was struck with the notion of doing a very gallant thing, and called out to her,—\n“My dear Miss Eliza, why are not you dancing? Mr. Darcy, you must allow me to present this young lady to you as a very desirable partner. You cannot refuse to dance, I am sure, when so much beauty is before you.” And, taking her hand, he would have given it to Mr. Darcy, who, though extremely surprised, was not unwilling to receive it, when she instantly drew back, and said with some discomposure to Sir William,—\n“Indeed, sir, I have not the least intention of dancing. I entreat you not to suppose that I moved this way in order to beg for a partner.”\nMr. Darcy, with grave propriety, requested to be allowed the honour of her hand, but in vain. Elizabeth was determined; nor did Sir William at all shake her purpose by his attempt at persuasion.\n“You excel so much in the dance, Miss Eliza, that it is cruel to deny me the happiness of seeing you; and though this gentleman dislikes the amusement in general, he can have no objection, I am sure, to oblige us for one half hour.”\n“Mr. Darcy is all politeness,” said Elizabeth, smiling.\n“He is, indeed: but considering the inducement, my dear Miss Eliza, we cannot wonder at his complaisance; for who would object to such a partner?”\nElizabeth looked archly, and turned away. Her resistance had not injured her with the gentleman, and he was thinking of her with some complacency, when thus accosted by Miss Bingley,—\n“I can guess the subject of your reverie.”\n“I should imagine not.”\n“You are considering how insupportable it would be to pass many evenings in this manner,—in such society; and, indeed, I am quite of your opinion. I was never more annoyed! The insipidity, and yet the noise—the nothingness, and yet the self-importance, of all these people! What would I give to hear your strictures on them!”\n“Your conjecture is totally wrong, I assure you. My mind was more agreeably engaged. I have been meditating on the very great pleasure which a pair of fine eyes in the face of a pretty woman can bestow.”\nMiss Bingley immediately fixed her eyes on his face, and desired he would tell her what lady had the credit of inspiring such reflections. Mr. Darcy replied, with great intrepidity,—\n“Miss Elizabeth Bennet.”\n“Miss Elizabeth Bennet!” repeated Miss Bingley. “I am all astonishment. How long has she been such a favourite? and pray when am I to wish you joy?”\n“That is exactly the question which I expected you to ask. A lady’s imagination is very rapid; it jumps from admiration to love, from love to matrimony, in a moment. I knew you would be wishing me joy.”\n“Nay, if you are so serious about it, I shall consider the matter as absolutely settled. You will have a charming mother-in-law, indeed, and of course she will be always at Pemberley with you.”\nHe listened to her with perfect indifference, while she chose to entertain herself in this manner; and as his composure convinced her that all was safe, her wit flowed along.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "Sir William commented to Mr. Darcy that dancing was a wonderful pastime for young people and, in his opinion, a prime indicator of sophisticated societies. Mr. Darcy agreed but pointed out that it was also popular among less refined groups, adding that even primitive people could dance. Sir William just smiled. After a pause, seeing Bingley approach, he continued, praising Bingley's delightful dancing and suggesting that Mr. Darcy must be equally skilled. Mr. Darcy reminded him that he had seen him dance at the Meryton ball. Sir William confirmed this, saying he had found it quite enjoyable, and asked if Darcy often danced in London society at St. James's. Darcy replied he never did. Sir William wondered if dancing wouldn't be a polite acknowledgment of the place. Darcy stated it was a courtesy he avoided paying anywhere, if possible. Sir William then presumed Darcy owned a house in London, which Darcy confirmed with a bow. Sir William mused that he had once thought about settling in London himself, being fond of high society, but wasn't sure the city air would agree with his wife, Lady Lucas. He paused, hoping for a reply, but Darcy remained silent. Just then, Elizabeth walked towards them, giving Sir William the idea for a grand gesture, and he called out to her, 'My dear Miss Eliza, why aren't you dancing? Mr. Darcy, you must allow me to introduce this young lady to you as a most desirable partner. You surely can't refuse to dance when such beauty is before you.' He took her hand, intending to place it in Mr. Darcy's, who, though taken aback, seemed willing to accept it. However, she quickly pulled back, saying to Sir William with some irritation, 'Indeed, sir, I have no intention of dancing at all. Please don't think I walked this way seeking a partner.' Mr. Darcy, with formal politeness, asked for the honour of dancing with her, but she was resolute. Sir William's attempts to persuade her did not change her mind. He pressed on, 'You dance so exceptionally, Miss Eliza, it's cruel not to let me enjoy watching you; and though this gentleman generally dislikes the activity, I'm sure he wouldn't object to obliging us for half an hour.' Elizabeth smiled and remarked, 'Mr. Darcy is exceedingly polite.' Sir William agreed, 'He is, indeed; but considering the reason, my dear Miss Eliza, his willingness is understandable; for who could object to such a partner?' Elizabeth gave a knowing look and turned away. Her refusal had not diminished her in Darcy's eyes; he was contemplating her with evident satisfaction when Miss Bingley interrupted him, 'I can guess what you're thinking about.' 'I doubt it,' he replied. 'You're reflecting on how unbearable it is to spend evenings like this, in such company,' Miss Bingley elaborated. 'And honestly, I completely agree. I've never been so irritated! The dullness, yet the noise—the insignificance, yet the arrogance, of these people! How I'd love to hear your criticisms of them!' 'Your guess is entirely wrong, I assure you,' Darcy stated. 'My mind was more pleasantly occupied. I was contemplating the great pleasure that a beautiful pair of eyes in the face of a pretty woman can provide.' Miss Bingley immediately stared at him, asking which lady had prompted such thoughts. Mr. Darcy answered boldly, 'Miss Elizabeth Bennet.' 'Miss Elizabeth Bennet!' Miss Bingley repeated, utterly astonished. 'How long has she been a favourite? And please, tell me when I should offer my congratulations?' 'That's exactly the question I expected you to ask,' Darcy replied. 'A woman's imagination is incredibly swift; it leaps from admiration to love, and from love to marriage, in an instant. I knew you'd be ready to congratulate me.' 'Well, if you're so serious about it,' Miss Bingley continued sarcastically, 'I shall consider it absolutely settled. You'll certainly have a charming mother-in-law, and of course, she'll always be staying at Pemberley with you.' He listened to her with complete detachment as she amused herself with these remarks; and seeing that his calm demeanour meant she was not annoying him, her teasing continued freely.",

Seeing Bingley joining the dancers, he added, \"Your friend dances wonderfully, and I don't doubt that you are also skilled, Mr. Darcy.\" \n\"I believe you saw me dance at Meryton, sir.\" \n\"Yes, and I quite enjoyed watching.

Please don't think I came over here looking for a partner.\" \nWith polite seriousness, Mr. Darcy asked for the honor of her hand, but she declined. Elizabeth was adamant; and all Sir William's attempts to persuade her had no effect. \n\"You dance so well, Miss Eliza, that it's unfair to deny me the pleasure of seeing you; and even though this gentleman usually dislikes dancing, I'm sure he wouldn't object to pleasing us for just half an hour.\" \n\"Mr. Darcy is always polite,\" said Elizabeth, smiling. \n\"Indeed he is. But given the incentive, Miss Eliza, who could blame him? Who wouldn't want such a partner?\" \nElizabeth gave him a mischievous look and turned away.

I was actually reflecting on the effect that beautiful eyes in a pretty woman's face can have.\" \nAt once, Miss Bingley watched him eagerly, and asked who this woman was. With great composure, Mr. Darcy answered, \"Miss Elizabeth Bennet.\" \n\"Miss Elizabeth Bennet!\" Miss Bingley repeated, surprised. \"I'm astonished. How long has she been a favorite of yours? When should I wish you congratulations?\" \n\"I knew you’d ask that. A lady’s imagination works so quickly—it leaps from admiration to love to marriage in an instant. I knew you’d be offering your congratulations.\" \n\"If you're that serious, I’ll take it as settled. You'll have a wonderful mother-in-law, who'll always be at Pemberley.\" \nHe listened with complete indifference as Miss Bingley amused herself, and seeing his calm demeanor, she continued her banter."

The two youngest of the family, Catherine and Lydia, were particularly frequent in these attentions: their minds were more vacant than their sisters’, and when nothing better offered, a walk to Meryton was necessary to amuse their morning hours and furnish conversation for the evening; and, however bare of news the country in general might be, they always contrived to learn some from their aunt. At present, indeed, they were well supplied both with news and happiness by the recent arrival of a militia regiment in the neighbourhood; it was to remain the whole winter, and Meryton was the head-quarters.\nTheir visits to Mrs. Philips were now productive of the most interesting intelligence.

Unfortunately for his daughters, this property was legally restricted and would pass to a distant male relative if he had no sons. His wife's inheritance, while adequate for her social standing, could not make up for the financial gap this created. Her father had been an attorney in Meryton and had left her four thousand pounds. She had one sister married to a Mr. Philips, who had worked as a clerk for their father and later succeeded him in the law practice, and a brother who had established himself in a respectable trade in London. The village of Longbourn was conveniently located only a mile from Meryton. This proximity meant the young ladies were frequently tempted to visit, usually three or four times a week, to see their aunt and a milliner's shop just opposite. The two youngest in the family, Catherine and Lydia, visited particularly often. Their minds were less engaged than their older sisters', and when there was nothing better to do, a walk to Meryton was needed to amuse their mornings and provide topics for conversation in the evening. Regardless of how little news there was in the country generally, they could always count on learning something from their aunt. Currently, they were exceptionally well-supplied with both news and happiness due to the recent arrival of a militia regiment in the area. It was scheduled to stay for the entire winter, with Meryton serving as its main base. Their visits to Mrs. Philips now yielded the most valuable information. Each day added to their understanding of the officers' names and backgrounds. Their places of lodging soon became known, and eventually, the young ladies began to meet the officers personally. Mr. Philips visited all of them, which provided his nieces with a source of joy they hadn't known before.

Unfortunately for his daughters, because the estate was entailed, it would pass to a distant male relative if no son was born, leaving his daughters without inheritance. Mrs. Bennet’s own fortune, while adequate for her needs, was not enough to make up for this shortfall—her father, a lawyer in Meryton, had left her four thousand pounds. Mrs. Bennet also had a sister married to Mr. Philips, who had been their father’s clerk and had taken over his business, as well as a brother engaged in a respectable trade in London. Longbourn, the family’s village, was conveniently just a mile from Meryton. This made it easy for the Bennet daughters to visit their aunt several times a week, and also a milliner’s shop nearby. The two youngest girls, Catherine and Lydia, made these trips especially often; being less occupied than their sisters, they relied on walks to Meryton to pass the time and find topics to discuss later. Even when little happened in the area, they always managed to pick up news from their aunt. Currently, the arrival of a militia regiment stationed in Meryton supplied them with a wealth of gossip and excitement, as the regiment was to stay throughout the winter. Every visit to Mrs. Philips yielded new information about the officers—their names, families, lodgings, and soon, personal acquaintance. Mr. Philips’s connections further opened doors, bringing his nieces happiness they had never known before. The girls became obsessed with talking about the officers, and in their eyes, even Mr. Bingley’s great wealth seemed insignificant compared to the attraction of a young officer in uniform."

I had hoped our opinions matched on every matter, but I must differ from you by considering our two youngest daughters exceptionally foolish.' 'My dear Mr. Bennet, you can't expect such young girls to have the good judgment of their father and mother. When they reach our age, I'm sure they won't think about officers any more than we do. I remember a time when I was very fond of a red coat myself—and truthfully, I still am at heart; and if a sharp young colonel with five or six thousand pounds a year wanted to marry one of my girls, I wouldn't object; and I thought Colonel Forster looked very handsome the other night at Sir William's in his military uniform.' 'Mama,' cried Lydia, 'my aunt says Colonel Forster and Captain Carter don't go to Miss Watson's as often as they used to; she sees them very often now standing in Clarke's library.' Mrs. Bennet's reply was interrupted by the entry of the footman carrying a note for Miss Bennet. It was from Netherfield, and the servant was waiting for an answer. Mrs. Bennet's eyes shone with delight, and she was eagerly calling out while her daughter read, 'Well, Jane, who is it from? What is it about? What does he say? Well, Jane, hurry and tell us; hurry, my love.' 'It is from Miss Bingley,' said Jane, and then proceeded to read it aloud.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "One morning, after hearing her daughters talk excitedly about officers, Mr. Bennet remarked with calm sarcasm that, based on their conversation, he was now sure that they were two of the silliest girls in the area; he had suspected as much for a while but was now convinced. Catherine was embarrassed and stayed quiet, while Lydia ignored the comment and continued chatting cheerfully about how much she admired Captain Carter and hoped to see him that day before he left for London the next morning. Mrs. Bennet expressed surprise that her husband would speak so disparagingly about their own children, insisting she would never think poorly of her own daughters. Mr. Bennet replied that if his children were silly, he ought to be aware of it. Mrs. Bennet retorted that, in fact, all their daughters were quite clever. Mr. Bennet cheekily disagreed, saying that this was the one point where he and his wife did not see eye to eye: he considered their two youngest daughters especially foolish. Mrs. Bennet said he could not expect the girls to have the same sense as their parents, but that when they grew older, they would stop preoccupying themselves with officers. She reminisced that she once liked officers in uniform herself, and secretly still did; if a wealthy young colonel wished to marry one of her daughters, she would not object, and she added that Colonel Forster had looked quite handsome recently at a party. Lydia then chimed in, telling her mother that her aunt had noticed Colonel Forster and Captain Carter no longer visited Miss Watson’s as often, but could frequently be seen at Clarke’s library. At that moment, the footman entered with a letter for Jane from Netherfield and waited for an answer. Mrs. Bennet, excited, pressed Jane to tell them who it was from and what it said. Jane replied that it was from Miss Bingley and read the letter aloud."

Elizabeth was glad to be taken to her immediately; and Jane, who had only been withheld by the fear of giving alarm or inconvenience, from expressing in her note how much she longed for such a visit, was delighted at her entrance. She was not equal, however, to much conversation; and when Miss Bingley left them together, could attempt little beside expressions of gratitude for the extraordinary kindness she was treated with. Elizabeth silently attended her.\nWhen breakfast was over, they were joined by the sisters; and Elizabeth began to like them herself, when she saw how much affection and solicitude they showed for Jane. The apothecary came; and having examined his patient, said, as might be supposed, that she had caught a violent cold, and that they must endeavour to get the better of it; advised her to return to bed, and promised her some draughts. The advice was followed readily, for the feverish symptoms increased, and her head ached acutely. Elizabeth did not quit her room for a moment, nor were the other ladies often absent; the gentlemen being out, they had in fact nothing to do elsewhere.\nWhen the clock struck three, Elizabeth felt that she must go, and very unwillingly said so. Miss Bingley offered her the carriage, and she only wanted a little pressing to accept it, when Jane testified such concern at parting with her that Miss Bingley was obliged to convert the offer of the chaise into an invitation to remain at Netherfield for the present. Elizabeth most thankfully consented, and a servant was despatched to Longbourn, to acquaint the family with her stay, and bring back a supply of clothes.",

Jane Bennet hadn't slept well and, despite being out of bed, was running a fever and too ill to leave her room. Elizabeth was eager to see her immediately, and Jane, who had only refrained from expressing her strong desire for this visit in her note out of concern about causing trouble or inconvenience, was overjoyed when Elizabeth entered. However, Jane wasn't up to much conversation. After Miss Bingley left them, Jane could manage little more than expressing her gratitude for the exceptional kindness she was receiving. Elizabeth stayed with her quietly.\n\nAfter breakfast, the Misses Bingley joined them. Elizabeth began to view them more favorably when she witnessed the deep affection and concern they displayed for Jane. The doctor arrived, examined Jane, and confirmed the suspected diagnosis: a severe cold that needed to be overcome. He recommended she return to bed and promised to send medicine. Jane readily followed this advice as her fever symptoms worsened and her head throbbed painfully. Elizabeth remained by her sister's side constantly, and the other ladies were also frequently present. Since the gentlemen were out, there wasn't much else for them to do.\n\nWhen it was three o'clock, Elizabeth felt she ought to leave and reluctantly mentioned this. Miss Bingley offered her a carriage. Elizabeth needed only a little persuasion to accept, but Jane showed such distress at the thought of her leaving that Miss Bingley felt compelled to change the offer of the carriage into an invitation for Elizabeth to stay at Netherfield for the time being. Elizabeth accepted with great thanks, and a servant was sent to Longbourn to inform her family of her extended stay and to fetch some clothes for her.",

Elizabeth was happy to visit her immediately. Jane, who had not wanted to reveal her longing for company in her note for fear of causing trouble, was overjoyed at Elizabeth's arrival. Though grateful, Jane was too weak for much conversation, so Elizabeth simply stayed with her. After breakfast, the other Bingley sisters joined them, and Elizabeth started to view them more favorably when she noticed their genuine concern for Jane. The doctor arrived and confirmed Jane had a severe cold, instructing her to return to bed and prescribing medicine. Jane's condition worsened, so Elizabeth rarely left her side, and the Bingley women also remained nearby since the gentlemen were away. When it was three o'clock, Elizabeth felt she should leave, but Jane was upset at the thought, so Miss Bingley, having first offered the carriage, instead invited Elizabeth to stay at Netherfield. Gratefully agreeing, Elizabeth sent word to her family at Longbourn and requested more clothes."

The sisters, on hearing this, repeated three or four times how much they were grieved, how shocking it was to have a bad cold, and how excessively they disliked being ill themselves; and then thought no more of the matter: and their indifference towards Jane, when not immediately before them, restored Elizabeth to the enjoyment of all her original dislike.\nTheir brother, indeed, was the only one of the party whom she could regard with any complacency.

After these brief expressions of sympathy, they dismissed the matter from their minds. Their apparent lack of care for Jane when she wasn't in the room confirmed Elizabeth's initial dislike of them. Their brother, Mr. Bingley, was in fact the only person at the gathering she could tolerate. His worry for Jane was obvious, and his pleasant attention towards Elizabeth was very appreciated. His behaviour prevented her from feeling as much like an unwelcome guest as she believed the others considered her. She received very little notice from anyone except him. Miss Bingley was absorbed by her focus on Mr. Darcy, and her sister was nearly as preoccupied. Mr. Hurst, seated next to Elizabeth, was a lazy man interested only in food, drink, and card games.

Upon hearing this, the sisters expressed their sympathy several times, remarked on how unpleasant it was to have a bad cold and how much they hated being sick themselves, but then quickly forgot about Jane’s illness. Their lack of real concern for Jane, once she was out of sight, made Elizabeth once again dislike them as much as she had before. The only person Elizabeth felt she could feel friendly toward was Bingley, whose concern for Jane was obvious and whose kindness to her helped her feel less like an unwelcome guest, which she sensed she was in the eyes of the rest. Hardly anyone else paid her attention. Miss Bingley and her sister were preoccupied with Mr. Darcy, while Mr. Hurst, who sat next to Elizabeth, was an idle man who only cared about eating, drinking, and playing cards, and when he noticed that Elizabeth preferred a simple dish over a fancy one, he had nothing further to say to her."

Her manners were pronounced to be very bad indeed,—a mixture of pride and impertinence: she had no conversation, no style, no taste, no beauty. Mrs. Hurst thought the same, and added,—\n“She has nothing, in short, to recommend her, but being an excellent walker. I shall never forget her appearance this morning. She really looked almost wild.”\n“She did indeed, Louisa. I could hardly keep my countenance. Very nonsensical to come at all! Why must she be scampering about the country, because her sister had a cold? Her hair so untidy, so blowzy!”\n“Yes, and her petticoat; I hope you saw her petticoat, six inches deep in mud, I am absolutely certain, and the gown which had been let down to hide it not doing its office.”\n“Your picture may be very exact, Louisa,” said Bingley; “but this was all lost upon me. I thought Miss Elizabeth Bennet looked remarkably well when she came into the room this morning. Her dirty petticoat quite escaped my notice.”\n“You observed it, Mr. Darcy, I am sure,” said Miss Bingley; “and I am inclined to think that you would not wish to see your sister make such an exhibition.”\n“Certainly not.”\n“To walk three miles, or four miles, or five miles, or whatever it is, above her ancles in dirt, and alone, quite alone! what could she mean by it? It seems to me to show an abominable sort of conceited independence, a most country-town indifference to decorum.”\n“It shows an affection for her sister that is very pleasing,” said Bingley.\n“I am afraid, Mr. Darcy,” observed Miss Bingley, in a half whisper, “that this adventure has rather affected your admiration of her fine eyes.”\n“Not at all,” he replied: “they were brightened by the exercise.” A short pause followed this speech, and Mrs. Hurst began again,—\n“I have an excessive regard for Jane Bennet,—she is really a very sweet girl,—and I wish with all my heart she were well settled. But with such a father and mother, and such low connections, I am afraid there is no chance of it.”\n“I think I have heard you say that their uncle is an attorney in Meryton?”\n“Yes; and they have another, who lives somewhere near Cheapside.”\n“That is capital,” added her sister; and they both laughed heartily.\n“If they had uncles enough to fill all Cheapside,” cried Bingley, “it would not make them one jot less agreeable.”\n“But it must very materially lessen their chance of marrying men of any consideration in the world,” replied Darcy.\nTo this speech Bingley made no answer; but his sisters gave it their hearty assent, and indulged their mirth for some time at the expense of their dear friend’s vulgar relations.",

As soon as she was out of sight, Miss Bingley started speaking poorly of her, deeming her manners truly dreadful, a mix of arrogance and rudeness. She claimed Elizabeth lacked conversational skills, elegance, good judgment, and attractiveness. Mrs. Hurst agreed completely, adding, \"Honestly, the only positive thing about her is that she's a great walker. I can't get over how she looked this morning; she seemed almost uncivilized.\" \"She really did, Louisa,\" chimed in Miss Bingley. \"I had trouble keeping a straight face. It was utterly foolish for her to come at all! Why on earth did she need to traipse across the countryside just because her sister had a slight cold? Her hair was such a mess, so disheveled!\" \"Yes, and what about her petticoat? I hope you noticed it, at least six inches deep in mud, I'm positive, and her dress, which she'd pulled down to cover it, wasn't even doing that job properly.\" Charles Bingley interjected, \"Your description might be accurate, Louisa, but I missed all that. I actually thought Miss Elizabeth Bennet looked remarkably well when she arrived this morning. Her muddy petticoat completely escaped my notice.\" Miss Bingley turned to Mr. Darcy, \"Surely, Mr. Darcy, you observed it. And I imagine you wouldn't approve of seeing your own sister present herself in such a way.\" \"Certainly not,\" he confirmed. \"Walking three, four, perhaps even five miles, wading through dirt up to her ankles, and entirely alone! What could she have been thinking? To me, it reveals an unpleasant kind of self-importance, a clear disregard for proper social conduct typical of someone from a small town.\" \"To me,\" Bingley countered, \"it shows a truly admirable devotion to her sister.\" \"Mr. Darcy,\" Miss Bingley whispered subtly, \"I fear this little adventure might have somewhat diminished your admiration for her lovely eyes.\" He replied, \"Not in the least; the exercise only made them shine brighter.\" A brief quiet moment followed his remark, and then Mrs. Hurst spoke again, \"I genuinely care for Jane Bennet; she is a genuinely sweet girl, and I sincerely wish she would find a good match. But with her parents and their rather common connections, I'm afraid it's unlikely to happen.\" Bingley inquired, \"Didn't I hear you mention their uncle is a lawyer in Meryton?\" \"Yes,\" she replied, \"and they have another who lives somewhere near Cheapside.\" \"How dreadful!\" her sister exclaimed, and they both burst into laughter. \"Even if they had enough uncles to fill the entire Cheapside area,\" Bingley declared, \"it wouldn't make them a bit less pleasant.\" Darcy responded, \"However, it will significantly reduce their prospects of marrying men of any standing in society.\" Bingley offered no reply to this, but his sisters enthusiastically agreed, and they continued to amuse themselves for some time at the expense of their dear friend's lower-class relatives.",

According to Miss Bingley, Elizabeth’s behavior was terrible, full of pride and rudeness, and she lacked charm, elegance, taste, and beauty. Mrs. Hurst agreed and added that Elizabeth’s only merit was her skill at walking; she would never forget how wild Elizabeth looked that morning. The sisters mocked the way Elizabeth came to Netherfield just because Jane was sick, especially her messy hair and muddy petticoat, which her gown failed to hide. Bingley said he hadn’t noticed any of this and thought Elizabeth looked quite well. Miss Bingley turned to Mr. Darcy, suggesting he wouldn’t want his own sister appearing in such a way. Darcy agreed. Miss Bingley found it shocking that Elizabeth would walk miles alone through the dirt, considering it a sign of arrogance and lack of proper manners. Bingley saw it instead as a sign of Elizabeth’s devotion to her sister. Miss Bingley whispered to Darcy that perhaps this incident had lessened his admiration of Elizabeth’s eyes, but Darcy replied that the exercise had only made them brighter. There was a moment of silence before Mrs. Hurst commented on her fondness for Jane, wishing she could marry well, but worried Jane’s family connections would prevent it. The others recalled that the Bennet girls’ uncle was a lawyer in Meryton and had another uncle living near Cheapside, which the sisters found hilarious and laughed about at length. Bingley declared that even if the Bennets had uncles all over Cheapside, it wouldn’t make Jane or Elizabeth any less pleasant, but Darcy pointed out that such connections would certainly reduce their chances of marrying well. The sisters agreed and continued making light of Jane and Elizabeth’s lower-class relatives."

Entering the drawing-room, she found everyone playing the card game loo and was immediately invited to join in. However, suspecting they were playing for high stakes, she declined the invitation. Using her sister as an excuse, she said she would occupy herself with a book for the brief time she would be down there. Mr. Hurst stared at her in disbelief.

I don't read excessively, and I find pleasure in many things.\" Bingley commented, \"I'm sure you find joy in caring for your sister, and I hope that joy will soon increase when you see her completely recovered.\" Elizabeth thanked him sincerely from her heart and then walked towards a table where a few books were laid out.

Mr. Darcy, your library at Pemberley is wonderful!\" Darcy replied, \"It should be good; it has been accumulated over many generations.\" \"And you've added so much to it yourself—you're always purchasing books,\" she added.

Charles, when you build your house, I hope it will be half as delightful as Pemberley.\" \"I hope so too,\" Bingley replied. \"But I would strongly advise you to buy property in that area and use Pemberley as a sort of model. Derbyshire is the finest county in England.\" Bingley responded eagerly, \"Absolutely; I'll buy Pemberley itself if Darcy is willing to sell it.\" Miss Bingley corrected him, \"I'm talking about realistic possibilities, Charles.\" Bingley retorted humourously, \"Honestly, Caroline, I'd think buying Pemberley would be more likely than building something that imitates it.\"",

She was still quite unwell, and Elizabeth refused to leave her side until it was late, only departing once her sister was asleep and Elizabeth felt it was proper, though not enjoyable, to rejoin everyone downstairs. Upon entering the living room, she found the others playing cards and was invited to join, but she suspected they were gambling and declined, using her sister as an excuse and saying she'd rather read for the little time she would stay. Mr. Hurst was surprised and asked if she preferred reading to playing cards, calling it unusual. Miss Bingley added that Elizabeth despised cards, was a keen reader, and didn't care for other activities. Elizabeth protested, saying she wasn't such a devoted reader and found pleasure in many things. Bingley remarked that caring for her sister must be one of those pleasures and hoped Jane would soon recover. Elizabeth thanked him sincerely and went to a table with some books. Bingley offered to bring her more from his library, lamenting that his collection was small because of his own laziness, but still more than he had ever read. Elizabeth said she could easily choose something from what was available. Miss Bingley complained that her father had left only a small library, and praised the wonderful library at Mr. Darcy's home, Pemberley. Darcy replied that it should be a good library since it had been built over generations, and Miss Bingley said Darcy had added much to it, as he was always buying books. Darcy stated he couldn't understand families neglecting their libraries. Miss Bingley insisted Darcy never neglected anything that improved his great estate, and suggested Charles, when he built his own house, should make it as beautiful as Pemberley. Charles agreed and joked he would buy Pemberley itself if Darcy sold it. Miss Bingley said she was speaking of possibilities, to which Charles replied that buying Pemberley outright would be more plausible than simply trying to imitate it."

Such a countenance, such manners, and so extremely accomplished for her age! Her performance on the pianoforte is exquisite.”\n“It is amazing to me,” said Bingley, “how young ladies can have patience to be so very accomplished as they all are.”\n“All young ladies accomplished! My dear Charles, what do you mean?”\n“Yes, all of them, I think. They all paint tables, cover screens, and net purses. I scarcely know any one who cannot do all this; and I am sure I never heard a young lady spoken of for the first time, without being informed that she was very accomplished.”\n“Your list of the common extent of accomplishments,” said Darcy, “has too much truth. The word is applied to many a woman who deserves it no otherwise than by netting a purse or covering a screen; but I am very far from agreeing with you in your estimation of ladies in general. I cannot boast of knowing more than half-a-dozen in the whole range of my acquaintance that are really accomplished.”\n“Nor I, I am sure,” said Miss Bingley.\n“Then,” observed Elizabeth, “you must comprehend a great deal in your idea of an accomplished woman.”\n“Yes; I do comprehend a great deal in it.”\n“Oh, certainly,” cried his faithful assistant, “no one can be really esteemed accomplished who does not greatly surpass what is usually met with. A woman must have a thorough knowledge of music, singing, drawing, dancing, and the modern languages, to deserve the word; and, besides all this, she must possess a certain something in her air and manner of walking, the tone of her voice, her address and expressions, or the word will be but half deserved.”\n“All this she must possess,” added Darcy; “and to all she must yet add something more substantial in the improvement of her mind by extensive reading.”\n“I am no longer surprised at your knowing only six accomplished women.

She soon put it completely aside, moving closer to the card game and positioning herself between Mr. Bingley and his older sister to watch. Miss Bingley inquired if Miss Darcy had grown much since the spring and if she would be as tall as herself. Bingley replied that he thought so, saying she was currently about the same height as Miss Elizabeth Bennet, or slightly taller. Miss Bingley expressed how much she longed to see her again, stating no one else had ever pleased her as much. She praised Miss Darcy's appearance, manners, and exceptional accomplishments for her age, particularly her superb piano playing. Bingley commented that he found it astonishing how young ladies possessed the patience to become as remarkably accomplished as they all were. \"All young ladies accomplished!\" exclaimed Miss Bingley, asking him what he meant. Bingley clarified, saying he believed so; they all painted tables, decorated screens, and knitted purses. He said he rarely knew anyone who couldn't do these things and that he had never heard a young woman mentioned for the first time without being told she was very accomplished. Darcy remarked that Bingley's list of common accomplishments was quite accurate, noting the term was applied to many women who deserved it solely for tasks like knitting a purse or decorating a screen. However, he strongly disagreed with Bingley's general assessment of women, claiming he knew no more than about six truly accomplished women among all his acquaintances. Miss Bingley agreed, saying, \"Nor I, I am sure.\" Elizabeth then observed that Darcy must have a very broad definition of an accomplished woman. He confirmed that he did. Miss Bingley, acting as his loyal supporter, declared that no one could genuinely be considered accomplished unless they significantly exceeded the usual standard. She specified that a woman must possess extensive knowledge of music, singing, drawing, dancing, and foreign languages to merit the title. Additionally, she added, she must have a certain grace in her demeanor, walk, voice, conversation, and words, or the description would only be partially true. Darcy added that she must possess all these qualities and, furthermore, cultivate her mind more substantially through extensive reading. Elizabeth commented that she was no longer surprised he only knew six accomplished women; she was now more surprised that he knew any at all. Darcy asked if she was being so harsh towards her own sex as to doubt such a combination was possible. Elizabeth responded that she had never encountered such a woman, never seen the combination of ability, taste, diligence, and elegance he described. Both Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley protested against the unfairness of her implied doubt, insisting they knew many women who fit the description, when Mr. Hurst abruptly interrupted them, complaining bitterly about their lack of attention to the card game.

After spending some time with Jane, when Miss Bingley invited them, Mrs. Bennet and her three other daughters went with her to the breakfast parlour. There, Bingley greeted them, hoping that Mrs. Bennet didn’t find Jane worse than expected. Mrs. Bennet responded that Jane was actually too sick to be moved, and that the doctor had advised against it, meaning they would have to rely on Bingley’s hospitality a little longer. Bingley insisted Jane mustn’t be moved, and Miss Bingley, in a polite but distant manner, assured Mrs. Bennet that Jane would receive all possible care while she stayed. Mrs. Bennet expressed her gratitude extensively."

He said, “I assure you, I am completely prepared to honor my commitment; and once your sister has recovered, you may, if you like, choose the exact day for the ball. But you surely wouldn’t wish to be dancing while she is unwell?” Lydia stated she was satisfied. “Oh yes,” she agreed, “it would be much better to wait until Jane is feeling better; and by then, Captain Carter will most likely be back in Meryton. And after you have your ball,” she added, “I will insist that *they* host one too. I will tell Colonel Forster it would be quite dishonorable if he doesn’t.” Mrs. Bennet and her daughters then departed. Elizabeth immediately returned to Jane, leaving her family’s, and her own, conduct open to the comments of the two ladies and Mr. Darcy. However, despite all of Miss Bingley’s witty remarks about Elizabeth’s ‘fine eyes,’ Mr. Darcy could not be persuaded to join in criticizing Elizabeth.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "Darcy merely smiled, and the uncomfortable silence that followed made Elizabeth anxious that her mother might say something embarrassing again. Elizabeth wanted to speak, but couldn't think of anything appropriate; after a brief pause, Mrs. Bennet began to thank Mr. Bingley once more for being so kind to Jane, while also apologizing for imposing on him with Lizzy. Mr. Bingley responded politely and politely encouraged his younger sister to do the same, though she did so with little warmth, but Mrs. Bennet was content and soon called for her carriage. This prompted her youngest daughter to step forward. During the visit, the two youngest girls had been whispering and had decided that the youngest, Lydia, would remind Mr. Bingley of his earlier promise to host a ball at Netherfield when he first arrived in the area. Lydia, fifteen, healthy and pretty, with a cheerful face, was her mother's favourite and had been introduced into society at a young age. Her lively spirit and the attention she received from officers had made her quite confident. She did not hesitate to remind Mr. Bingley about the ball, bluntly insisting that it would be a great shame if he did not keep his promise. Mr. Bingley's response pleased Mrs. Bennet very much; he assured them he was happy to keep his word and suggested they choose the date once Jane had recovered, asking if they would really want to dance while Jane was still unwell. Lydia agreed and added that it would be better to wait until Jane was healthy, hoping that Captain Carter would be back by then, and joked that after Mr. Bingley's ball, she would insist the officers host another. Mrs. Bennet and her daughters then left, and Elizabeth hurried back to Jane, leaving the others to discuss the behaviour of her family; yet, despite Miss Bingley's sarcasm about Elizabeth's 'fine eyes,' Mr. Darcy would not join in criticizing her."

Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley had spent some hours of the morning with the invalid, who continued, though slowly, to mend; and, in the evening, Elizabeth joined their party in the drawing-room. The loo table, however, did not appear. Mr. Darcy was writing, and Miss Bingley, seated near him, was watching the progress of his letter, and repeatedly calling off his attention by messages to his sister. Mr. Hurst and Mr. Bingley were at piquet, and Mrs. Hurst was observing their game.\nElizabeth took up some needlework, and was sufficiently amused in attending to what passed between Darcy and his companion. The perpetual commendations of the lady either on his hand-writing, or on the evenness of his lines, or on the length of his letter, with the perfect unconcern with which her praises were received, formed a curious dialogue, and was exactly in unison with her opinion of each.\n“How delighted Miss Darcy will be to receive such a letter!”\nHe made no answer.\n“You write uncommonly fast.”\n“You are mistaken. I write rather slowly.”\n“How many letters you must have occasion to write in the course of a year! Letters of business, too! How odious I should think them!”\n“It is fortunate, then, that they fall to my lot instead of to yours.”\n“Pray tell your sister that I long to see her.”\n“I have already told her so once, by your desire.”\n“I am afraid you do not like your pen. Let me mend it for you. I mend pens remarkably well.”\n“Thank you—but I always mend my own.”\n“How can you contrive to write so even?”\nHe was silent.\n“Tell your sister I am delighted to hear of her improvement on the harp, and pray let her know that I am quite in raptures with her beautiful little design for a table, and I think it infinitely superior to Miss Grantley’s.”\n“Will you give me leave to defer your raptures till I write again?

Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley spent several hours in the morning with the person who was recovering, who continued to improve, albeit slowly. In the evening, Elizabeth joined their company in the drawing-room. However, the table for the card game 'loo' was not set up. Mr. Darcy was busy writing, and Miss Bingley, sitting close by, was observing the progression of his letter. She frequently diverted his attention by relaying messages for his sister. Mr. Hurst and Mr. Bingley were playing piquet, and Mrs. Hurst was watching their game.\nElizabeth picked up her needlework and found herself quite entertained by observing the interaction between Darcy and his companion. The lady's constant praise, whether for his handwriting, the straightness of his lines, or the sheer length of his letter, combined with the complete indifference with which he received her compliments, formed an unusual exchange that aligned perfectly with Elizabeth's assessment of each of them.\nMiss Bingley exclaimed, “How pleased Miss Darcy will be to get such a letter!”\nHe offered no response.\n“You are writing remarkably quickly,” she commented.\n“You are mistaken,” he replied. “I write rather slowly.”\n“You must have occasion to write so many letters throughout the year! And business letters too! I would find those utterly unpleasant!”\n“It is fortunate, then,” he said, “that they are my responsibility instead of yours.”\n“Please make sure to tell your sister that I am eager to see her.”\n“I have already conveyed that to her once, at your request,” he stated.\n“I fear you don’t like your pen. Let me sharpen it for you. I am particularly skilled at mending pens.”\n“Thank you,” he responded, “but I always take care of my own.”\n“How do you manage to write so neatly and evenly?” she inquired.\nHe remained silent.\n“Please tell your sister I am delighted to hear of her progress on the harp,” she continued, “and please let her know that I am absolutely thrilled with her lovely small design for a table. I truly believe it is vastly superior to Miss Grantley’s.”\n“Would you allow me to postpone mentioning your strong admiration until I write again?” he asked. “Currently, I do not have enough space to do them justice.”",

Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley spent part of the morning with the recovering patient, who was slowly getting better. In the evening, Elizabeth joined everyone in the drawing-room, but they did not play loo as before.

Mr. Hurst and Mr. Bingley were playing piquet, watched by Mrs. Hurst. Elizabeth occupied herself with some needlework, interested by the exchanges between Darcy and Miss Bingley. Miss Bingley continually praised Darcy’s handwriting, the neatness of his lines, or the length of his letter, but he received her compliments with indifference, which matched Elizabeth’s view of both their characters.\n\nMiss Bingley exclaimed how pleased Miss Darcy would be to receive such a letter, but Darcy did not reply. She commented on how quickly he wrote, to which he disagreed and said he actually wrote slowly. She remarked he must write many letters each year, including business ones, which she would hate to do, and Darcy said it was lucky the task fell to him, not her. She asked him to tell his sister of her desire to see her, but he replied he had already done so at her prior request. Miss Bingley offered to fix his pen, claiming she was very good at it, but Darcy politely declined, saying he preferred to mend his own pens. When she asked how he managed to write so evenly, he did not answer. Miss Bingley continued with praise for Miss Darcy’s progress on the harp and her superior table design, requesting Darcy to pass on her admiration. He replied that he would wait and include her compliments in a future letter, as there was no room left in the current one."

But do you always write such charming long letters to her, Mr. Darcy?”\n“They are generally long; but whether always charming, it is not for me to determine.”\n“It is a rule with me, that a person who can write a long letter with ease cannot write ill.”\n“That will not do for a compliment to Darcy, Caroline,” cried her brother, “because he does not write with ease. He studies too much for words of four syllables. Do not you, Darcy?”\n“My style of writing is very different from yours.”\n“Oh,” cried Miss Bingley, “Charles writes in the most careless way imaginable. He leaves out half his words, and blots the rest.”\n“My ideas flow so rapidly that I have not time to express them; by which means my letters sometimes convey no ideas at all to my correspondents.”\n“Your humility, Mr. Bingley,” said Elizabeth, “must disarm reproof.”\n“Nothing is more deceitful,” said Darcy, “than the appearance of humility. It is often only carelessness of opinion, and sometimes an indirect boast.”\n“And which of the two do you call my little recent piece of modesty?”\n“The indirect boast; for you are really proud of your defects in writing, because you consider them as proceeding from a rapidity of thought and carelessness of execution, which, if not estimable, you think at least highly interesting. The power of doing anything with quickness is always much prized by the possessor, and often without any attention to the imperfection of the performance. When you told Mrs. Bennet this morning, that if you ever resolved on quitting Netherfield you should be gone in five minutes, you meant it to be a sort of panegyric, of compliment to yourself; and yet what is there so very laudable in a precipitance which must leave very necessary business undone, and can be of no real advantage to yourself or anyone else?”\n“Nay,” cried Bingley, “this is too much, to remember at night all the foolish things that were said in the morning. And yet, upon my honour, I believed what I said of myself to be true, and I believe it at this moment. At least, therefore, I did not assume the character of needless precipitance merely to show off before the ladies.”\n“I daresay you believed it; but I am by no means convinced that you would be gone with such celerity. Your conduct would be quite as dependent on chance as that of any man I know; and if, as you were mounting your horse, a friend were to say, ‘Bingley, you had better stay till next week,’ you would probably do it—you would probably not go—and, at another word, might stay a month.”\n“You have only proved by this,” cried Elizabeth, “that Mr. Bingley did not do justice to his own disposition. You have shown him off now much more than he did himself.”\n“I am exceedingly gratified,” said Bingley, “by your converting what my friend says into a compliment on the sweetness of my temper. But I am afraid you are giving it a turn which that gentleman did by no means intend; for he would certainly think the better of me if, under such a circumstance, I were to give a flat denial, and ride off as fast as I could.”\n“Would Mr. Darcy then consider the rashness of your original intention as atoned for by your obstinacy in adhering to it?”\n“Upon my word, I cannot exactly explain the matter—Darcy must speak for himself.”",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "Miss Bingley begins by saying the matter is unimportant and she will see the person in question in January. She then asks Mr. Darcy if he consistently writes such delightful and lengthy letters to her. Darcy replies that his letters are typically long but says he cannot judge if they are always delightful. Miss Bingley states her personal rule that someone who can compose a long letter with ease must be a good writer. Her brother, Bingley, interjects, saying this doesn't compliment Darcy because he doesn't write with ease; he spends too much time carefully selecting complex words, and asks Darcy if this is not the case. Darcy responds that his writing style is very different from Bingley's. Miss Bingley exclaims that Charles writes in an incredibly disorganized way, leaving out many words and smudging the others. Bingley explains that his thoughts flow so rapidly he lacks the time to fully articulate them, resulting in letters that sometimes convey no meaning at all to his correspondents. Elizabeth remarks that Mr. Bingley's modesty must shield him from criticism. Darcy then comments that nothing is more misleading than the appearance of humility, which is often just a lack of concern for others' opinions or, at times, a subtle form of boasting. Bingley asks which of these two descriptions applies to his recent small display of modesty. Darcy identifies it as the subtle boast, arguing that Bingley is actually proud of his flaws in writing because he views them as stemming from quick thinking and careless execution, traits he considers at least highly interesting, if not admirable. Darcy explains that people often highly value the ability to do things quickly, regardless of the quality of the performance. He uses Bingley's morning comment to Mrs. Bennet about leaving Netherfield in five minutes as an example, suggesting it was meant as a self-compliment, asking what is truly praiseworthy about a sudden rush that leaves necessary tasks undone and offers no real benefit. Bingley protests, calling it excessive to recall foolish morning remarks at night, but insists that he genuinely believed what he said about himself at the time and still does, meaning he wasn't merely pretending to be unnecessarily hasty to impress the ladies. Darcy replies that while he believes Bingley thought it, he is unconvinced Bingley would leave so quickly, asserting that Bingley's behaviour would be as unpredictable as anyone's he knows. He adds that if a friend suggested Bingley stay until the next week while he was mounting his horse, he would likely do so, and with another word, might stay for a month. Elizabeth points out that Darcy has merely proven that Mr. Bingley underestimated his own character, effectively making him appear much better than he presented himself. Bingley expresses great pleasure that Elizabeth is interpreting his friend's comment as praise for his gentle nature, but suspects she is twisting the meaning, as Darcy would certainly think more highly of him if he had given a firm refusal and left promptly in such a situation. Elizabeth then asks if Mr. Darcy would consider the rashness of Bingley's original intention to be excused by his stubbornness in adhering to it. Bingley admits he cannot fully explain the matter and says Darcy must explain it himself.",

But, Mr. Darcy—do you always write such lovely long letters to her?\"\n\n\"They are usually long, but as for whether they're always delightful, I can’t say myself.\"\n\n\"My rule is that anyone who can easily compose a long letter can’t possibly be a bad writer.\"\n\n\"That won’t do as a compliment for Darcy, Caroline,\" her brother interjected, \"since he doesn’t write letters easily.

He leaves out half the words and smudges all the rest.\"\n\n\"My ideas come to me so quickly I don’t have time to write them all down. Because of that, sometimes my letters are so jumbled my correspondents don’t understand me at all.\"\n\n\"Your modesty, Mr. Bingley, makes you immune to criticism,\" Elizabeth remarked.\n\n\"Nothing is more misleading,\" Darcy added, \"than the appearance of humility. Sometimes it’s just a disregard for what people think, and sometimes it’s really a backhanded way of boasting.\"\n\n\"And which do you think my bit of modesty just now was?\"\n\n\"The indirect boast; you're actually rather proud of your flaws in writing, because you think they stem from quick thinking and a hasty approach—which, if not admirable, you believe is at least interesting. The ability to do something quickly is always prized by the person who has it, and not much attention is paid to whether the result is imperfect. When you told Mrs. Bennet this morning that if you decided to leave Netherfield you’d be gone in five minutes, you meant it as praise of your own decisiveness. But really, what’s so commendable about rushing off and leaving important matters unfinished, which doesn’t really help yourself or anyone else?\"\n\n\"Now that’s a bit much,\" Bingley protested, \"to remember every silly thing I said this morning. But still, honestly, I meant what I said, and I still believe it about myself. At least I wasn’t just trying to show off in front of the ladies.\"\n\n\"I’m sure you believed it,\" said Darcy, \"but I don’t think you’d really leave so quickly. Your actions are as likely to be influenced by chance as anyone else’s; if, as you were about to ride away, a friend suggested you stay another week, you probably would—you might not leave at all, and could even stay another month just as easily.\"\n\n\"You’ve only shown,\" said Elizabeth, \"that Mr. Bingley undersold himself. You just flattered him more than he did himself.\"\n\n\"I’m very pleased,\" said Bingley, \"that you turned my friend’s remarks into praise for my good nature. But I’m afraid you’re spinning it in a way he didn’t intend; he’d think better of me if I just insisted on going and left immediately.\"\n\n\"Would Mr. Darcy, then, believe that the impulsiveness of your original plan would be forgiven by your stubbornness in sticking to it?\"\n\n\"Honestly, I can’t say exactly—Darcy should explain himself.\""

A regard for the requester would often make one readily yield to a request, without waiting for arguments to reason one into it. I am not particularly speaking of such a case as you have supposed about Mr. Bingley. We may as well wait, perhaps, till the circumstance occurs, before we discuss the discretion of his behaviour thereupon. But in general and ordinary cases, between friend and friend, where one of them is desired by the other to change a resolution of no very great moment, should you think ill of that person for complying with the desire, without waiting to be argued into it?”\n“Will it not be advisable, before we proceed on this subject, to arrange with rather more precision the degree of importance which is to appertain to this request, as well as the degree of intimacy subsisting between the parties?”\n“By all means,” cried Bingley; “let us hear all the particulars, not forgetting their comparative height and size, for that will have more weight in the argument, Miss Bennet, than you may be aware of. I assure you that if Darcy were not such a great tall fellow, in comparison with myself, I should not pay him half so much deference. I declare I do not know a more awful object than Darcy on particular occasions, and in particular places; at his own house especially, and of a Sunday evening, when he has nothing to do.”\nMr. Darcy smiled; but Elizabeth thought she could perceive that he was rather offended, and therefore checked her laugh. Miss Bingley warmly resented the indignity he had received, in an expostulation with her brother for talking such nonsense.\n“I see your design, Bingley,” said his friend. “You dislike an argument, and want to silence this.”\n“Perhaps I do. Arguments are too much like disputes. If you and Miss Bennet will defer yours till I am out of the room, I shall be very thankful; and then you may say whatever you like of me.”\n“What you ask,” said Elizabeth, “is no sacrifice on my side; and Mr. Darcy had much better finish his letter.”",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "Mr. Darcy began, 'You're attributing opinions to me that I've never held, but you claim are mine. However, even if we accept your version of events, you must remember, Miss Bennet, that the friend who supposedly wanted me to stay and postpone my plans simply *wished* it, asked it without providing any reasons why it would be the right thing to do.'\nElizabeth replied, 'So, readily and easily giving in to a friend's persuasion isn't a positive trait in your eyes?'\nDarcy responded, 'Giving in without being genuinely convinced isn't flattering to the intelligence of either person.'\nElizabeth pressed, 'It seems to me, Mr. Darcy, that you don't give enough importance to the power of friendship and affection. Respect for the person making a request would often lead someone to agree easily, without needing logical arguments to be persuaded. I'm not necessarily referring to the specific scenario you imagined about Mr. Bingley; perhaps we should wait until that situation actually occurs before discussing the wisdom of his actions. But in typical, everyday interactions between friends, if one friend asks the other to change a minor decision, would you really think badly of that person for agreeing without waiting to be argued into it?'\nDarcy suggested, 'Before we continue on this matter, wouldn't it be wise to define more precisely how important this request is supposed to be, as well as the level of closeness between the individuals involved?'\n'Absolutely!' exclaimed Bingley. 'Let's hear all the specifics, making sure to include their comparative height and size, because, Miss Bennet, that's actually more influential in the argument than you might realize. I assure you, if Darcy weren't such a great, tall fellow compared to me, I wouldn't show him half as much respect. I honestly think Darcy can be quite intimidating at certain times and in specific places, especially at his own home on a Sunday evening when he has nothing else to do.'\nMr. Darcy smiled, but Elizabeth thought she saw a hint of annoyance, which made her suppress her own laugh. Miss Bingley strongly objected to the insult Darcy had received, scolding her brother for talking such nonsense.\n'I see what you're doing, Bingley,' his friend said. 'You dislike arguments and want to end this one.'\n'Perhaps I do. Arguments are too much like disagreements. If you and Miss Bennet would be kind enough to postpone yours until I've left the room, I would be very grateful; then you can say whatever you like about me.'\n'What you're asking,' said Elizabeth, 'is no trouble for me to agree to; and Mr. Darcy really ought to get back to finishing his letter.'",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "You expect me to justify opinions that you attribute to me, even though I never claimed them as my own. Still, even if we take your version of events, remember, Miss Bennet, that the friend who supposedly wanted him to return and delay his plans simply requested it, without providing any reasoning as to why it would be appropriate.\n\nTo give in easily or quickly to a friend's persuasion is not, in your view, something admirable.\n\nGiving in without being convinced is not flattering to anyone's intellect.\n\nMr. Darcy, you seem to overlook the impact of friendship and affection. Often, out of regard for a friend, a person may grant a request without needing to be reasoned into it. I'm not specifically speaking about the situation with Mr. Bingley that you mentioned—we should perhaps wait until it actually happens before discussing whether his conduct is wise. But, generally, between friends, if one asks the other to change their mind about something minor, would you judge that person harshly for agreeing without needing to be persuaded?\n\nWouldn't it be better, before we continue, to be more specific about how important the request is and how close the friends are?\n\n\"Absolutely,\" exclaimed Bingley. \"Let's hear all the details, including their height and size, since that might matter more than you think, Miss Bennet. Honestly, if Darcy wasn't so much taller than me, I wouldn't defer to him nearly as much. I can't think of anything more intimidating than Darcy in certain situations, especially in his own house on a quiet Sunday evening.\"\n\nDarcy smiled, but Elizabeth thought he seemed a little offended, so she held back her laughter. Miss Bingley was upset on Darcy's behalf and scolded her brother for being ridiculous.\n\n\"I see what you're doing, Bingley,\" said Darcy. \"You don't like arguing and want to end this conversation.\"\n\n\"Perhaps you're right. Arguments feel too much like conflicts. If you and Miss Bennet postpone your debate until I'm gone, I'd appreciate it. You can say anything you like about me then.\"\n\n\"That's no trouble for me,\" said Elizabeth, \"and Mr. Darcy should just finish writing his letter.\""

I dearly love a laugh.”\n“Miss Bingley,” said he, “has given me credit for more than can be. The wisest and best of men,—nay, the wisest and best of their actions,—may be rendered ridiculous by a person whose first object in life is a joke.”\n“Certainly,” replied Elizabeth, “there are such people, but I hope I am not one of them. I hope I never ridicule what is wise or good. Follies and nonsense, whims and inconsistencies, do divert me, I own, and I laugh at them whenever I can. But these, I suppose, are precisely what you are without.”\n“Perhaps that is not possible for anyone.

He owns it himself without disguise.”\n“No,” said Darcy, “I have made no such pretension. I have faults enough, but they are not, I hope, of understanding. My temper I dare not vouch for. It is, I believe, too little yielding; certainly too little for the convenience of the world. I cannot forget the follies and vices of others so soon as I ought, nor their offences against myself. My feelings are not puffed about with every attempt to move them. My temper would perhaps be called resentful. My good opinion once lost is lost for ever.”\n“That is a failing, indeed!” cried Elizabeth. “Implacable resentment is a shade in a character. But you have chosen your fault well. I really cannot laugh at it. You are safe from me.”\n“There is, I believe, in every disposition a tendency to some particular evil, a natural defect, which not even the best education can overcome.”\n“And your defect is a propensity to hate everybody.”\n“And yours,” he replied, with a smile, “is wilfully to misunderstand them.”",

If it is the first reason, I would be entirely in your way; and if it is the second, I can admire you much better while I am seated by the fire.”\n“Oh, how awful!” cried Miss Bingley. “I have never heard anything so detestable. How can we possibly punish him for saying such a thing?”\n“It is quite simple, if you are willing,” said Elizabeth. “We can all annoy and take revenge on one another. Tease him—make fun of him. Considering your closeness, you must know exactly how it is done.”\n“But upon my honour, I truly do not know. I assure you that our intimacy has not yet taught me that. Tease his calm temperament and self-possession? No, no; I feel certain he is immune there. And as for laughter, we should not expose ourselves, if you please, by attempting to laugh without a valid reason. Mr. Darcy can feel quite pleased with himself.”\n“Mr. Darcy is someone who cannot be laughed at!” exclaimed Elizabeth. “That is an unusual advantage, and I sincerely hope it remains unusual, because it would be a great pity for me to have many acquaintances like that. I am extremely fond of a good laugh.”\n“Miss Bingley,” he stated, “has given me credit for more than is warranted. The wisest and most virtuous individuals—indeed, their most sensible actions—can be made to look silly by someone whose main purpose in life is to make jokes.”\n“Certainly,” Elizabeth replied, “there are people like that, but I sincerely hope I am not one of them. I hope I never mock anything wise or good. Follies and nonsense, whims and inconsistencies, *do* amuse me, I must admit, and I laugh at them whenever the opportunity arises. But these, I assume, are precisely the things you lack.”\n“Perhaps that is not possible for anyone.

He admits it himself quite openly.”\n“No,” said Darcy, “I have made no such claim. I have plenty of faults, but I hope they are not related to my understanding. My temper, I cannot guarantee. I believe it is too unyielding; certainly too inflexible for the world’s convenience. I cannot forget the foolishness and vices of others as quickly as I should, nor the wrongs they commit against me. My emotions are not easily influenced by every attempt to affect them. My temper might perhaps be described as unforgiving. Once I have lost my good opinion of someone, it is lost permanently.”\n“That *is* a definite failing!” cried Elizabeth. “Unwavering resentment is a negative aspect of a character. But you have chosen your fault well. I honestly cannot laugh at it. You are safe from me.”\n“There is, I believe, in every personality a tendency towards some specific flaw, a natural defect, which not even the best upbringing can overcome.”\n“And *your* defect,” she stated, “is a propensity to dislike everyone.”\n“And yours,” he replied with a smile, “is to deliberately misunderstand them.”",

Miss Bingley reacted, shocked by his cheeky explanation, asking how he should be punished for such a response. Elizabeth suggested it would be easy if they wanted, joking that they could tease or laugh at him, and that Miss Bingley should know how. Miss Bingley replied that, on the contrary, she had never learned how to unsettle Mr. Darcy, as his calmness made him untouchable, and besides, they wouldn't want to force a laugh. Elizabeth teased that Mr. Darcy wasn't to be laughed at, calling it a rare advantage and hoping it remained so, as she dearly enjoyed laughing. Mr. Darcy observed that Miss Bingley credited him with too much; anyone, even the wisest, can be made to look ridiculous by a person who only wants to joke. Elizabeth agreed such people exist but hoped she was not among them, assuring that she only laughed at folly and nonsense, not wisdom or goodness, and suggested that these were exactly what Darcy lacked. Darcy replied that no one is without those weaknesses, but he always strove to avoid traits that make a strong mind ridiculous. Elizabeth named vanity and pride as such weaknesses. Darcy agreed vanity was a flaw, but thought pride, when justified by true ability, was proper and controlled. Elizabeth turned away to hide her smile. Miss Bingley pointedly asked Elizabeth what she thought of Mr. Darcy after this interrogation. Elizabeth replied, mockingly, that she believed Mr. Darcy confessed to no faults. Darcy protested, saying he had plenty of faults, just not of understanding, though his temper could be overly inflexible and he found it hard to forget others' faults or offenses. His feelings weren’t easily swayed, and once he lost good opinion of someone, it was permanent. Elizabeth declared this to be a real flaw—unforgiving resentment—though she couldn't laugh at him for it. Darcy responded that everyone has a particular, inherent failing. Elizabeth quipped that Darcy’s was to hate everyone, to which Darcy replied, smiling, that hers was to deliberately misunderstand them."

Why could not he keep on quarrelling with you, as his father did before him?”\n“Why, indeed, he does seem to have had some filial scruples on that head, as you will hear.”\n“Hunsford, near Westerham, Kent, 15th October.\n“Dear Sir,\n“The disagreement subsisting between yourself and my late honoured father always gave me much uneasiness; and, since I have had the misfortune to lose him, I have frequently wished to heal the breach: but, for some time, I was kept back by my own doubts, fearing lest it might seem disrespectful to his memory for me to be on good terms with anyone with whom it had always pleased him to be at variance.”—‘There, Mrs. Bennet.’—“My mind, however, is now made up on the subject; for, having received ordination at Easter, I have been so fortunate as to be distinguished by the patronage of the Right Honourable Lady Catherine de Bourgh, widow of Sir Lewis de Bourgh, whose bounty and beneficence has preferred me to the valuable rectory of this parish, where it shall be my earnest endeavour to demean myself with grateful respect towards her Ladyship, and be ever ready to perform those rites and ceremonies which are instituted by the Church of England. As a clergyman, moreover, I feel it my duty to promote and establish the blessing of peace in all families within the reach of my influence; and on these grounds I flatter myself that my present overtures of good-will are highly commendable, and that the circumstance of my being next in the entail of Longbourn estate will be kindly overlooked on your side, and not lead you to reject the offered olive branch. I cannot be otherwise than concerned at being the means of injuring your amiable daughters, and beg leave to apologize for it, as well as to assure you of my readiness to make them every possible amends; but of this hereafter. If you should have no objection to receive me into your house, I propose myself the satisfaction of waiting on you and your family, Monday, November 18th, by four o’clock, and shall probably trespass on your hospitality till the Saturday se’nnight following, which I can do without any inconvenience, as Lady Catherine is far from objecting to my occasional absence on a Sunday, provided that some other clergyman is engaged to do the duty of the day. I remain, dear sir, with respectful compliments to your lady and daughters, your well-wisher and friend,\n“William Collins.”",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "After enjoying their anticipation for a little while, he revealed, 'I got this letter about a month ago, and replied about two weeks ago. I considered it a rather sensitive matter needing prompt attention. It's from my cousin, Mr. Collins, who is the person who will inherit this house when I die, and he'll have the right to ask you all to leave whenever he likes.'\n'Oh, dearest,' his wife exclaimed, 'I cannot bear to hear you speak of that. Please, let's not talk about that dreadful man. I truly believe it is the most unfair situation imaginable, that your property is tied up by entail so it can't pass to your own daughters. I'm certain if I were in your place, I would have taken steps to try and change it ages ago.'\nJane and Elizabeth attempted to clarify the nature of the entail for her. They had tried numerous times before, but it was a topic where Mrs. Bennet was completely immune to logic. She continued to complain bitterly about the injustice of the estate being legally designated away from a family with five daughters and given instead to a man for whom no one had any affection.\n'It certainly is a most unfair business,' Mr. Bennet conceded. 'And there's no way to excuse Mr. Collins from the consequence of inheriting Longbourn. But if you will listen to his letter, perhaps his way of writing might make him seem slightly less disagreeable to you.'\n'No, absolutely not. I'm sure it won't. And I think it was extremely rude of him to write to you at all, and very deceitful. I cannot stand such insincere people. Why couldn't he just keep up the feud, as his father did before him?'\n'Well, it seems he did have some reservations about disrespecting his father in that regard, as you'll soon hear,' Mr. Bennet replied.\nHe then read the letter:\n'Hunsford, near Westerham, Kent,\nOctober 15th.\nDear Sir,\nThe disagreement that existed between you and my late respected father always caused me considerable distress. Since I have had the misfortune of losing him, I have often wished to mend the division. However, for some time, I hesitated due to my own uncertainties, fearing it might appear disrespectful to his memory for me to be on friendly terms with someone with whom he always chose to be in conflict.'—'See, Mrs. Bennet,' Mr. Bennet interjected.\n'My mind is now settled on the matter, though. Since I was ordained at Easter, I have had the great fortune to be favoured with the patronage of the Right Honourable Lady Catherine de Bourgh, the widow of Sir Lewis de Bourgh. Her generosity has appointed me to the valuable position of Rector in this parish, where I intend to conscientiously conduct myself with grateful deference towards her Ladyship and always be ready to perform the religious duties prescribed by the Church of England. Furthermore, as a clergyman, I feel it is my duty to encourage and establish peace within all families I can influence. On these grounds, I flatter myself that my current offers of reconciliation are highly commendable, and that my position as the next in line for the Longbourn estate will be kindly overlooked by your family and will not lead you to reject the offer of peace. I cannot help but feel concern for being the one who will cause harm to your lovely daughters, and I wish to apologize for this, as well as assure you of my willingness to do everything possible to make amends; but more on this at a later time. If you have no objection to hosting me in your home, I propose to give myself the pleasure of visiting you and your family on Monday, November 18th, by four o'clock, and will likely remain as your guest until the following Saturday week. This is feasible for me as Lady Catherine is quite agreeable to my occasional absence on a Sunday, provided that another clergyman is arranged to perform the service for the day. I remain, dear sir, with respectful regards to your wife and daughters, your well-wisher and friend, William Collins.'",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "After keeping his family guessing for a while, Mr. Bennet explained, “About a month ago I received a letter, which I replied to two weeks later because it seemed to require prompt attention. It was from my cousin, Mr. Collins, who, once I’m gone, could potentially force you all to leave this house at his discretion.”\n\nMrs. Bennet exclaimed, “Oh, my dear, I can’t stand to hear that! Please don’t mention that dreadful man. It’s so unfair that your estate can’t go to your own children; if I were you, I would have tried long ago to change that.”\n\nJane and Elizabeth tried to explain the concept of an entail to her, as they had done many times before, but Mrs. Bennet remained irrational on the matter and continued to complain about how unjust it was for the property to pass to a man no one cared about, instead of five daughters.\n\nMr. Bennet quipped, “It certainly is a terrible affair, and nothing can pardon Mr. Collins for being the inheritor of Longbourn. But if you listen to his letter, perhaps you’ll find his tone somewhat conciliatory.”\n\nMrs. Bennet replied, “Absolutely not! I find it so insolent of him to write at all. He’s so false. Why couldn’t he just keep up the family feud like his father did?”\n\nMr. Bennet continued, “He does seem to have some doubts about that, as you’ll hear.”\n\nHe then read the letter from Mr. Collins, dated from Hunsford in Kent, October 15th, in which Mr. Collins expresses how the dispute between his father and Mr. Bennet made him uncomfortable, but after his father’s death and being ordained, he now wishes to reconcile. He credits Lady Catherine de Bourgh for giving him his position in the parish, and as a clergyman feels obligated to promote peace in families. Mr. Collins hopes that his position as heir to Longbourn doesn’t sour relations. He apologizes for the harm this may cause the Bennet daughters and suggests he will try to make amends, but provides no detail yet. Finally, he asks if he may visit the Bennets on Monday, November 18, and stay until the following Saturday, given Lady Catherine allows him such absences if the church is covered. He signs off with respectful regards as their well-wisher and friend, William Collins."

There is something very pompous in his style. And what can he mean by apologizing for being next in the entail? We cannot suppose he would help it, if he could. Can he be a sensible man, sir?”\n“No, my dear; I think not. I have great hopes of finding him quite the reverse. There is a mixture of servility and self-importance in his letter which promises well.

The idea of the olive branch perhaps is not wholly new, yet I think it is well expressed.”\nTo Catherine and Lydia neither the letter nor its writer were in any degree interesting. It was next to impossible that their cousin should come in a scarlet coat, and it was now some weeks since they had received pleasure from the society of a man in any other colour. As for their mother, Mr. Collins’s letter had done away much of her ill-will, and she was preparing to see him with a degree of composure which astonished her husband and daughters.",

Elizabeth was most struck by his excessive respect for Lady Catherine and his earnest dedication to performing his clerical duties of baptizing, marrying, and burying his parishioners whenever needed. She declared, “I believe he must be quite eccentric. I simply can't figure him out. His writing style seems very inflated. And what could he possibly mean by apologizing for being the next heir? We can't assume he could change it even if he wanted to. Do you think he's a man of good judgment, sir?” “No, my dear,” Mr. Bennet replied, “I rather hope he is the complete opposite. His letter shows a promising blend of submissiveness and self-importance. I am eager to meet him.” Mary observed that, from a writing perspective, his letter seemed well-composed. While the concept of an 'olive branch' might not be entirely original, she thought it was clearly expressed. Catherine and Lydia found neither the letter nor its author interesting at all. It was highly unlikely their cousin would arrive in a military uniform, and they hadn't enjoyed the company of any man not wearing one for weeks. As for their mother, Mr. Collins’s letter had significantly lessened her earlier resentment, and she was preparing to receive him with an unexpected calmness that surprised both her husband and her daughters.",

His writing style is rather grandiose. And why does he apologize for being next in line to inherit? We can’t think he could help it even if he wanted to. Do you think he’s a reasonable man, sir?\"\n\n\"No, my dear; I doubt it. In fact, I’m quite hopeful he’ll be just the opposite. His letter combines flattery and self-importance in a way that bodes well. I’m eager to meet him.\"\n\n\"In terms of how it’s written,\" said Mary, \"the letter isn’t lacking. The olive branch idea isn’t entirely original, but I think it’s nicely put.\"\n\nCatherine and Lydia, however, found neither the letter nor its author the least bit interesting. Their cousin was unlikely to arrive in a red military uniform, and it had been weeks since they’d enjoyed the company of a man in any other attire.

She had also asked him twice to dine at Rosings, and had sent for him only the Saturday before, to make up her pool of quadrille in the evening. Lady Catherine was reckoned proud by many people, he knew, but he had never seen anything but affability in her. She had always spoken to him as she would to any other gentleman; she made not the smallest objection to his joining in the society of the neighbourhood, nor to his leaving his parish occasionally for a week or two to visit his relations. She had even condescended to advise him to marry as soon as he could, provided he chose with discretion; and had once paid him a visit in his humble parsonage, where she had perfectly approved all the alterations he had been making, and had even vouchsafed to suggest some herself,—some shelves in the closets upstairs.",

He therefore introduced a topic he expected Mr. Collins would excel at, remarking on how fortunate Mr. Collins seemed to be with his patroness. Lady Catherine de Bourgh's apparent attention to his desires and concern for his comfort struck Mr. Bennet as quite remarkable, and he felt he couldn't have chosen a better subject. Mr. Collins responded with great enthusiasm and praise for her. This topic made him adopt an even more serious and dignified manner than usual, and with a very earnest expression, he declared that he had never in his life seen such behaviour from a person of high status—such friendliness and willingness to engage with those below her—as he had personally experienced from Lady Catherine. She had been kind enough to approve both of the sermons he had already had the privilege of preaching before her. She had also invited him to dine at Rosings twice and had recently, just the previous Saturday, sent for him to fill a spot in her evening card game, quadrille. Mr. Collins admitted that many people considered Lady Catherine proud, but he insisted he had only ever witnessed her affability. He stated that she always spoke to him as she would to any other gentleman. She had not the slightest objection to him participating in local society or occasionally leaving his parish for a week or two to visit his relatives.

He remarked on how attentive Lady Catherine was to Mr. Collins’s needs and comfort. Mr. Bennet’s choice of topic was apt, as Mr. Collins responded with great enthusiasm, praising Lady Catherine profusely. This discussion made Mr. Collins even more serious than usual, and with a very earnest look, he declared that he had never seen such good behavior in someone of high rank—such friendliness and graciousness—as Lady Catherine showed him. She had complimented the two sermons he had preached before her, invited him to dine at Rosings twice, and had even asked him over just the previous Saturday to complete her game of cards. Although many people considered Lady Catherine proud, Mr. Collins insisted he had only ever experienced kindness from her. She always spoke to him as she would to any gentleman, placed no restrictions on his social interactions in the neighborhood, nor on his taking occasional trips to visit family. She had graciously advised him to marry soon, as long as he chose wisely, and had even visited his modest home, approving of his renovations and kindly offering suggestions herself, such as adding shelves to the upstairs closets."

A fortunate chance had recommended him to Lady Catherine de Bourgh when the living of Hunsford was vacant; and the respect which he felt for her high rank, and his veneration for her as his patroness, mingling with a very good opinion of himself, of his authority as a clergyman, and his right as a rector, made him altogether a mixture of pride and obsequiousness, self-importance and humility.\nHaving now a good house and a very sufficient income, he intended to marry; and in seeking a reconciliation with the Longbourn family he had a wife in view, as he meant to choose one of the daughters, if he found them as handsome and amiable as they were represented by common report.

He spent the majority of his years under the strict guidance of a father who was both illiterate and miserly. Although he attended university, he merely completed the required studies without forming any useful relationships. The disciplined way his father raised him initially gave him a very humble demeanor. However, this humility was largely undermined by the arrogance arising from his weak intellect, his secluded lifestyle, and the considerable feelings of importance that came with his sudden and early prosperity. A fortunate set of circumstances led to his being recommended to Lady Catherine de Bourgh when the Hunsford position became vacant. The deep respect he felt for her noble rank and his admiration for her as his patroness, coupled with his high opinion of himself, his authority as a clergyman, and his rights as a rector, resulted in him being a peculiar blend of pride and servility, self-importance and modesty. Having acquired a comfortable house and a more than adequate income, he resolved to marry. His effort to make peace with the Longbourn family was driven by his intention to select one of their daughters as his wife, assuming they were as attractive and pleasant as generally described. He viewed this as his method of making amends—a form of compensation—for inheriting their father's property, and he judged it to be an excellent scheme, thoroughly fitting and appropriate, and exceedingly generous and unselfish on his part.",

Even though he went to one of the universities, he only attended as required and did not make any valuable friendships there. The strict upbringing from his father had initially made him very humble, but this was later offset by the vanity of a simple mind, living in seclusion, and the effects of unexpected good fortune early in life. By a stroke of luck, he was recommended to Lady Catherine de Bourgh when the position of the Hunsford parson became available; the admiration and reverence he felt for her, combined with a high opinion of his own status as a clergyman and rector, resulted in him being a peculiar mix of pride and obsequiousness, self-importance and humility. With a comfortable home and income now secured, he planned to marry; and when making amends with the Longbourn family, he already had it in mind to choose one of the daughters as his wife, provided they met the favorable descriptions he had heard. He believed this approach would sufficiently atone for his inheriting their father’s estate, seeing it as a plan both fitting and generous, and he prided himself on his own selflessness in the matter."

She stated that regarding her younger daughters, she couldn't be certain or promise anything, but she wasn't aware of them being romantically attached.

Regarding him, she could only share details her nieces were already aware of: that Mr. Denny had accompanied him from London and that he was scheduled to receive a lieutenant's position in the ----shire regiment. She mentioned she had been observing him for the past hour as he walked along the street, and added that if Mr. Wickham had shown up, Kitty and Lydia would undoubtedly have kept watching. However, unfortunately, the only people who passed the windows now were a few officers, who, compared to the new arrival, seemed 'dull, unpleasant men.' Some of these officers were scheduled to have dinner with the Philipses the following day. The aunt promised that her husband would visit Mr. Wickham and extend an invitation to him as well, provided the family from Longbourn agreed to come over in the evening. This plan was accepted. Mrs. Philips enthusiastically declared that they would enjoy a pleasant, comfortable, and lively game of lottery tickets, followed by a small hot supper. The anticipation of these enjoyable activities was quite uplifting, and they separated feeling cheerful. As he left the room, Mr. Collins repeated his apologies, and he was repeatedly assured, with unfailing politeness, that his apologies were entirely unnecessary.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "Mr. Denny and Mr. Wickham accompanied the young ladies to Mr. Philips's house, but despite Lydia's persistent requests and Mrs. Philips's enthusiastic invitation from the parlour window, the gentlemen politely declined to come in. Mrs. Philips was always pleased to see her nieces, and she was especially happy to see the two eldest after their time away. She expressed her surprise at their sudden return, saying she wouldn't have known about it if she hadn't met Mr. Jones's shopboy in the street, who told her not to send any more medicines to Netherfield because the Miss Bennets had left. Just as she was welcoming them, Jane introduced Mr. Collins, who was greeted with her finest manners, which he returned with even greater formality, apologizing for visiting without having known her before, though he hoped their family connection made it acceptable. Mrs. Philips was quite taken aback by his excessive politeness, but her attention was soon diverted by questions about the other newcomer. She could only tell her nieces that Mr. Denny had brought Mr. Wickham from London and that he was to become a lieutenant in the regiment. She said she had been watching him strolling in the street for the past hour, and if Mr. Wickham had appeared, Kitty and Lydia would have continued watching, but unfortunately now only a few officers passed by, who seemed dull compared to the new visitor. Some officers were invited to dine with the Philipses the next day, and Mrs. Philips promised to have her husband invite Mr. Wickham as well, if the Longbourn family joined them in the evening. Everyone agreed, and Mrs. Philips assured them of a lively game and a light supper afterwards. The prospect was delightful, and they all parted in high spirits. Mr. Collins again apologized when leaving, and was repeatedly told by Mrs. Philips that there was no need."

Upon entering the drawing-room, the girls were delighted to learn that Mr. Wickham had accepted their uncle's invitation and was already inside the house. After receiving this news and settling into their seats, Mr. Collins had time to look around and express his admiration. He was so impressed by the size and furnishings of the room that he remarked it almost made him feel as though he were in the small summer breakfast parlour at Rosings. This comparison initially did not resonate as a compliment, but once Mrs. Philips understood from him what Rosings was and who owned it, and after hearing his description of just one of Lady Catherine's drawing-rooms and learning that the fireplace alone cost eight hundred pounds, she fully appreciated the compliment and likely would not have minded being compared even to the housekeeper's room. Mr. Collins happily occupied himself by describing the magnificence of Lady Catherine and her estate, occasionally mentioning the virtues and ongoing enhancements of his own modest parsonage, until the gentlemen joined them. He found Mrs. Philips to be a very attentive listener, whose respect for his importance grew with every word he spoke, and who intended to repeat everything she heard to her neighbours as soon as possible. For the girls, however, who found it difficult to pay attention to their cousin and had nothing to do but wish for a musical instrument or examine the unremarkable ceramic imitations on the mantelpiece, the waiting period felt exceedingly long. Eventually, it ended. The gentlemen did arrive, and when Mr. Wickham entered the room, Elizabeth felt confirmed that her previous views and subsequent thoughts about him had not been based on any unreasonable admiration. The officers from the shire regiment were generally a respectable and gentlemanly group, and the finest among them were present, but Mr. Wickham surpassed them all in appearance, expression, demeanor, and posture, just as they were clearly superior to the broad-faced, port-drinking, rather unrefined uncle Philips who followed them into the room.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "Since no one objected to the young ladies spending the evening with their aunt, and Mr. Collins was able to get over his reservations about leaving Mr. and Mrs. Bennet for just one evening, he and his five cousins were taken by carriage to Meryton at the appropriate time. Upon arriving in the drawing-room, the girls were delighted to learn that Mr. Wickham had accepted their uncle’s invitation and was already there. After everyone sat down, Mr. Collins had the chance to look around and was so impressed by the size and decoration of the room that he remarked it reminded him of the small summer breakfast parlour at Rosings—a comparison that wasn’t flattering at first. However, when Mrs. Philips understood that Rosings was Lady Catherine’s grand estate and heard about its costly features—the chimney-piece alone costing eight hundred pounds—she recognized the compliment and wouldn’t have minded if the comparison had been to even a servant’s quarters. Mr. Collins continued happily describing Lady Catherine’s home and her grandeur, frequently mentioning his own more modest dwelling and its recent improvements. Mrs. Philips listened with great interest, becoming more impressed with Mr. Collins and eager to share what she learned with her neighbors. Meanwhile, the girls, uninterested in their cousin’s stories, spent the time wishing for some music and inspecting their own mediocre china on the mantelpiece, so the wait felt long. Eventually, the men joined the group, and when Mr. Wickham entered, Elizabeth realized that, despite her previous thoughts, she had not allowed herself any irrational admiration for him. The regiment’s officers were generally handsome and well-mannered, with the best among them present that evening, but Mr. Wickham surpassed them all in looks and manner, just as they outshone the portly, red-faced Uncle Philips, who, smelling strongly of port wine, entered after them."

Still, what she most wanted to know—his history with Mr. Darcy—she did not expect him to share, and she didn’t dare bring up the subject herself.

          "text_segment": "“You may well be surprised, Miss Bennet, at such an assertion, after seeing, as you probably might, the very cold manner of our meeting yesterday. Are you much acquainted with Mr. Darcy?”\n“As much as I ever wish to be,” cried Elizabeth, warmly. “I have spent four days in the same house with him, and I think him very disagreeable.”\n“I have no right to give my opinion,” said Wickham, “as to his being agreeable or otherwise. I am not qualified to form one. I have known him too long and too well to be a fair judge. It is impossible for me to be impartial. But I believe your opinion of him would in general astonish—and, perhaps, you would not express it quite so strongly anywhere else. Here you are in your own family.”\n“Upon my word I say no more here than I might say in any house in the neighbourhood, except Netherfield. He is not at all liked in Hertfordshire. Everybody is disgusted with his pride. You will not find him more favourably spoken of by anyone.”\n“I cannot pretend to be sorry,” said Wickham, after a short interruption, “that he or that any man should not be estimated beyond their deserts; but with him I believe it does not often happen. The world is blinded by his fortune and consequence, or frightened by his high and imposing manners, and sees him only as he chooses to be seen.”\n“I should take him, even on my slight acquaintance, to be an ill-tempered man.”\nWickham only shook his head.\n“I wonder,” said he, at the next opportunity of speaking, “whether he is likely to be in this country much longer.”\n“I do not at all know; but I heard nothing of his going away when I was at Netherfield. I hope your plans in favour of the ——shire will not be affected by his being in the neighbourhood.”\n“Oh no—it is not for me to be driven away by Mr. Darcy. If he wishes to avoid seeing me he must go. We are not on friendly terms, and it always gives me pain to meet him, but I have no reason for avoiding him but what I might proclaim to all the world—a sense of very great ill-usage, and most painful regrets at his being what he is. His father, Miss Bennet, the late Mr. Darcy, was one of the best men that ever breathed, and the truest friend I ever had; and I can never be in company with this Mr. Darcy without being grieved to the soul by a thousand tender recollections. His behaviour to myself has been scandalous; but I verily believe I could forgive him anything and everything, rather than his disappointing the hopes and disgracing the memory of his father.”\nElizabeth found the interest of the subject increase, and listened with all her heart; but the delicacy of it prevented further inquiry.\nMr. Wickham began to speak on more general topics, Meryton, the neighbourhood, the society, appearing highly pleased with all that he had yet seen, and speaking of the latter, especially, with gentle but very intelligible gallantry.\n“It was the prospect of constant society, and good society,” he added, “which was my chief inducement to enter the ——shire. I know it to be a most respectable, agreeable corps; and my friend Denny tempted me further by his account of their present quarters, and the very great attentions and excellent acquaintance Meryton had procured them. Society, I own, is necessary to me. I have been a disappointed man, and my spirits will not bear solitude. I must have employment and society. A military life is not what I was intended for, but circumstances have now made it eligible. The church ought to have been my profession—I was brought up for the church; and I should at this time have been in possession of a most valuable living, had it pleased the gentleman we were speaking of just now.”\n“Indeed!”\n“Yes—the late Mr. Darcy bequeathed me the next presentation of the best living in his gift. He was my godfather, and excessively attached to me. I cannot do justice to his kindness. He meant to provide for me amply, and thought he had done it; but when the living fell, it was given elsewhere.”\n“Good heavens!” cried Elizabeth; “but how could that be? How could his will be disregarded? Why did not you seek legal redress?”\n“There was just such an informality in the terms of the bequest as to give me no hope from law. A man of honour could not have doubted the intention, but Mr. Darcy chose to doubt it—or to treat it as a merely conditional recommendation, and to assert that I had forfeited all claim to it by extravagance, imprudence, in short, anything or nothing. Certain it is that the living became vacant two years ago, exactly as I was of an age to hold it, and that it was given to another man; and no less certain is it, that I cannot accuse myself of having really done anything to deserve to lose it. I have a warm unguarded temper, and I may perhaps have sometimes spoken my opinion of him, and to him, too freely. I can recall nothing worse. But the fact is, that we are very different sort of men, and that he hates me.”\n“This is quite shocking! He deserves to be publicly disgraced.”\n“Some time or other he will be—but it shall not be by me. Till I can forget his father, I can never defy or expose him.”\nElizabeth honoured him for such feelings, and thought him handsomer than ever as he expressed them.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "Mr. Wickham expressed surprise at Elizabeth's assertion, given their noticeably cold interaction the previous day. He asked if she knew Mr. Darcy well. Elizabeth responded heatedly, saying she knew him \"as much as she ever wished to,\" having spent four days in the same house and finding him \"very disagreeable.\" Wickham stated he wasn't qualified to judge if Darcy was agreeable, having known him too long and too well to be objective, and found it impossible to be impartial. However, he believed her opinion would generally be surprising and suggested she might not express it so forcefully elsewhere, implying she felt comfortable doing so within her family. Elizabeth insisted she said the same things anywhere in the neighborhood, except Netherfield. She claimed Darcy was disliked throughout Hertfordshire and everyone found his pride disgusting, assuring Wickham he wouldn't hear anyone speak more favorably of him. After a pause, Wickham commented he couldn't pretend to be upset that a man wasn't rated higher than he deserved, though he felt this didn't often happen with Darcy. He suggested the world was blinded by Darcy's wealth and status or intimidated by his haughty demeanor, seeing him only as he presented himself. Elizabeth added that even from her brief acquaintance, she judged Darcy to be ill-tempered. Wickham merely shook his head. Later, Wickham wondered aloud if Darcy intended to stay in the country much longer. Elizabeth replied she didn't know but hadn't heard of his departure while at Netherfield, and hoped his presence wouldn't disrupt Wickham's plans for the militia. Wickham declared he wouldn't be driven away by Mr. Darcy; if Darcy wanted to avoid him, Darcy must leave. He admitted they weren't friendly and meeting Darcy was painful, but his only reason for avoidance was a deep sense of mistreatment and sorrow over the man Darcy had become. He described the late Mr. Darcy, his godfather, as one of the best men and a true friend, explaining that being in his son's company always stirred painful memories. He called Darcy's behavior towards him scandalous but claimed he could forgive anything except Darcy's failure to live up to his father's hopes and honor his memory. Elizabeth's interest grew, and she listened intently, though the sensitive nature of the topic prevented her from asking further questions. Mr. Wickham then steered the conversation to broader topics like Meryton, the area, and the local society, seeming very pleased with what he'd seen and expressing polite, though clear, admiration for the latter. He explained that the prospect of consistent and good society was his main motivation for joining the militia regiment, which he knew to be respectable. His friend Denny's account of their current lodgings and the excellent connections made in Meryton further persuaded him. He admitted society was essential to him, having been disappointed and unable to bear solitude; he needed occupation and company. Though military life wasn't his original path, circumstances made it viable. He had been raised for the church and should currently hold a very valuable church position, had the gentleman they just spoke of allowed it. Elizabeth exclaimed her surprise. Wickham confirmed that the late Mr. Darcy had left him the right to present someone to the next vacant prime church position under his patronage. He reiterated that Mr. Darcy Sr., his godfather, was extremely fond of him and intended to provide for him generously, believing he had done so. However, when the position became available, it was given to someone else. Elizabeth cried out in disbelief, asking how that was possible, why his will was ignored, and why Wickham didn't pursue legal action. Wickham explained there was a slight informality in the bequest's wording that left him no legal recourse. He felt a man of honor wouldn't have doubted the late Mr. Darcy's clear intention, but Mr. Darcy Jr. chose to question it or treat it merely as a conditional recommendation, claiming Wickham had forfeited any right through extravagance and imprudence—in short, any or no reason. He stated it was certain the position was vacant two years prior, exactly when he was old enough to hold it, and it was given to another man. Equally certain, he felt, was that he had done nothing deserving of losing it. He admitted to having a quick, unrestrained temper and might have spoken his opinion of and to Darcy too freely at times, but recalled nothing worse. The fact, he concluded, was that they were fundamentally different men, and Darcy hated him. Elizabeth found this utterly shocking and felt Darcy deserved public disgrace. Wickham believed Darcy would be disgraced eventually, but vowed it wouldn't be by him. He stated that until he could forget Darcy's father, he could never challenge or expose the son. Elizabeth admired these sentiments and thought him even more handsome as he voiced them.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "Miss Bennet, you may indeed be surprised by what I just asserted, considering, as you probably saw, how cold and distant our encounter was yesterday. Are you well acquainted with Mr. Darcy?\"\n\n\"About as well as I'd ever wish to be,\" Elizabeth replied with feeling. \"I’ve spent four days in the same house as him, and I find him most disagreeable.\"\n\n\"I really shouldn't express an opinion,\" Wickham responded, \"on whether he is pleasant or not. I’m not fit to judge. I’ve known him too long and too well to be impartial. I admit it’s impossible for me to be unbiased. But generally, I think your opinion of him would surprise most people—and perhaps you wouldn’t state it so boldly anywhere else. Here, you’re surrounded by family.\"\n\n\"Honestly, I say nothing here that I wouldn’t say elsewhere in the area, apart from at Netherfield. He’s not at all well liked in Hertfordshire. Everyone is sick of his pride. You’ll hear no one speak favorably of him.\"\n\n\"I can’t pretend to be upset,\" said Wickham, after a short pause, \"that he or any man should not be given more praise than they deserve; but with him, I don’t think that happens often. People are blinded by his wealth and rank, or intimidated by his imposing manners, and only see him as he chooses to be seen.\"\n\n\"Even though I hardly know him, I believe him to be a bad-tempered man.\"\n\nWickham just shook his head.\n\nLater, he said, \"I wonder if he plans to stay in this area much longer.\"\n\n\"I really don’t know; but while I was at Netherfield, I heard nothing about him leaving. I hope Mr. Darcy's presence doesn’t interfere with your intentions regarding the regiment.\"\n\n\"Oh no, I wouldn’t let Mr. Darcy drive me away. If he wishes to avoid me, he must be the one to leave. We aren’t on friendly terms, and I am always distressed to see him, but my only reasons for avoiding him are ones I could announce to everyone: I feel very wronged and deeply regret how he turned out. His father, Miss Bennet—the late Mr. Darcy—was one of the best men I’ve known, my truest friend; and every time I’m with his son, I’m overcome by painful memories. His behavior towards me has been outrageous; but honestly, I could forgive him almost anything except how he’s let down the hopes and tarnished the memory of his father.\"\n\nElizabeth grew even more interested and listened intently, though polite restraint kept her from asking more. Wickham then shifted the conversation to more general subjects—the area, the people, and the society—speaking highly and graciously about them all.\n\n\"It was the promise of constant and pleasant company,\" he continued, \"that attracted me to this regiment. I know it to be the most respectable, amiable corps, and my friend Denny tempted me further by telling me about their current quarters and the wonderful connections at Meryton. I need good company. I have been disappointed in life, and solitude depresses me. I must have work and social interaction. The military wasn’t my original path, but circumstances forced it upon me. I was supposed to enter the church—that was my upbringing. Were it not for the person we were just discussing, I’d hold a valuable position there now.\"\n\n\"Really!\"\n\n\"Yes—the late Mr. Darcy left me the next chance at the best position he had to offer. He was my godfather and cared deeply about me. I could never adequately describe his kindness. He meant to provide for me well, and thought he had; but when the post became available, it went to someone else.\"\n\n\"Good heavens!\" exclaimed Elizabeth. \"How could that happen? How could his wishes be ignored? Why didn’t you seek legal remedy?\"\n\n\"There was a technical flaw in the way the bequest was worded, so I had no grounds in law. Any man of honor would have understood the intention, but Mr. Darcy chose to dispute it—or treat it as just a conditional recommendation, claiming that I’d lost all right to it through extravagance or recklessness, really for any reason or none at all. The fact is, the position became vacant two years ago, when I was old enough to take it, but it was given to another. And I cannot blame myself for anything that would merit losing it. I have a rather open temperament, and maybe I’ve sometimes criticized him too freely. But that’s the worst I can think of. The truth is, we are very different people, and he hates me.\"\n\n\"This is appalling! He deserves to be exposed.\"\n\n\"Perhaps he will be someday—but not by me. As long as I remember his father, I could never challenge or disgrace him.\"\n\nElizabeth respected him all the more for these sentiments, and thought he looked even more attractive as he expressed them."

          "text_segment": "“But what,” said she, after a pause, “can have been his motive? what can have induced him to behave so cruelly?”\n“A thorough, determined dislike of me—a dislike which I cannot but attribute in some measure to jealousy. Had the late Mr. Darcy liked me less, his son might have borne with me better; but his father’s uncommon attachment to me irritated him, I believe, very early in life. He had not a temper to bear the sort of competition in which we stood—the sort of preference which was often given me.”\n“I had not thought Mr. Darcy so bad as this—though I have never liked him, I had not thought so very ill of him—I had supposed him to be despising his fellow-creatures in general, but did not suspect him of descending to such malicious revenge, such injustice, such inhumanity as this!”\nAfter a few minutes’ reflection, however, she continued, “I do remember his boasting one day, at Netherfield, of the implacability of his resentments, of his having an unforgiving temper. His disposition must be dreadful.”\n“I will not trust myself on the subject,” replied Wickham; “I can hardly be just to him.”\nElizabeth was again deep in thought, and after a time exclaimed, “To treat in such a manner the godson, the friend, the favourite of his father!” She could have added, “A young man, too, like you, whose very countenance may vouch for your being amiable.” But she contented herself with—“And one, too, who had probably been his own companion from childhood, connected together, as I think you said, in the closest manner.”\n“We were born in the same parish, within the same park; the greatest part of our youth was passed together: inmates of the same house, sharing the same amusements, objects of the same parental care. My father began life in the profession which your uncle, Mr. Philips, appears to do so much credit to; but he gave up everything to be of use to the late Mr. Darcy, and devoted all his time to the care of the Pemberley property. He was most highly esteemed by Mr. Darcy, a most intimate, confidential friend. Mr. Darcy often acknowledged himself to be under the greatest obligations to my father’s active superintendence; and when, immediately before my father’s death, Mr. Darcy gave him a voluntary promise of providing for me, I am convinced that he felt it to be as much a debt of gratitude to him as of affection to myself.”\n“How strange!” cried Elizabeth. “How abominable! I wonder that the very pride of this Mr. Darcy has not made him just to you. If from no better motive, that he should not have been too proud to be dishonest,—for dishonesty I must call it.”\n“It is wonderful,” replied Wickham; “for almost all his actions may be traced to pride; and pride has often been his best friend. It has connected him nearer with virtue than any other feeling. But we are none of us consistent; and in his behaviour to me there were stronger impulses even than pride.”\n“Can such abominable pride as his have ever done him good?”\n“Yes; it has often led him to be liberal and generous; to give his money freely, to display hospitality, to assist his tenants, and relieve the poor. Family pride, and filial pride, for he is very proud of what his father was, have done this. Not to appear to disgrace his family, to degenerate from the popular qualities, or lose the influence of the Pemberley House, is a powerful motive. He has also brotherly pride, which, with some brotherly affection, makes him a very kind and careful guardian of his sister; and you will hear him generally cried up as the most attentive and best of brothers.”\n“What sort of a girl is Miss Darcy?”\nHe shook his head. “I wish I could call her amiable. It gives me pain to speak ill of a Darcy; but she is too much like her brother,—very, very proud. As a child, she was affectionate and pleasing, and extremely fond of me; and I have devoted hours and hours to her amusement. But she is nothing to me now. She is a handsome girl, about fifteen or sixteen, and, I understand, highly accomplished. Since her father’s death her home has been London, where a lady lives with her, and superintends her education.”",

What prompted him to act with such cruelty?\" Wickham replied, \"A complete and firm dislike of me—a dislike I can't help but think is partly due to jealousy. If the elder Mr. Darcy had been less fond of me, his son might have tolerated me better. But I believe his father's unusual fondness for me angered him from a young age. He couldn't handle the kind of rivalry we were in, the sort of favouritism I often received.\" Elizabeth said, \"I hadn't thought Mr. Darcy was this bad. Even though I've never liked him, I didn't have such a terrible opinion of him. I assumed he generally looked down on everyone, but I didn't suspect him of stooping to such malicious revenge, such unfairness, such inhumanity!\" After a few minutes of thinking, she added, \"However, I do recall him boasting one day at Netherfield about how he never forgave a slight, about his unforgiving nature. His character must be awful.\" Wickham responded, \"I shouldn't discuss it further; I can barely be fair to him.\" Elizabeth was again lost in thought, then exclaimed, \"To treat his father's godson, friend, and favourite in such a way!\" She could have added, \"And a young man like you, whose face itself suggests you are pleasant.\" But she limited herself to saying, \"And someone, too, who had probably been his childhood companion, connected as closely as you mentioned, I believe.\" Wickham explained, \"We were born in the same parish, within the same park; most of our youth was spent together. We lived in the same house, shared the same pastimes, and received the same parental care. My father started his career in the profession that your uncle, Mr. Philips, seems to excel at, but he gave up everything to assist the late Mr. Darcy and dedicated all his time to managing the Pemberley estate. Mr. Darcy held him in the highest regard, viewing him as a most intimate and trusted friend. Mr. Darcy often admitted he was greatly indebted to my father's diligent oversight, and when, just before my father died, Mr. Darcy spontaneously promised to provide for me, I am sure he felt it was as much a debt of gratitude to my father as affection for me.\" \"How strange!\" Elizabeth exclaimed. \"How awful! I'm surprised this Mr. Darcy's very pride didn't make him treat you fairly. If for no other reason, he should have been too proud to be dishonest—because I must call it dishonesty.\" \"It is remarkable,\" Wickham agreed, \"because almost all his actions stem from pride, and pride has often served him well. It has brought him closer to virtue than any other feeling. But none of us are entirely consistent, and his behaviour towards me was driven by even stronger impulses than pride.\" \"Could such terrible pride as his ever have done him good?\" she asked. \"Yes,\" he replied, \"it has often led him to be generous and open-handed; to spend his money freely, to be hospitable, to help his tenants, and relieve the poor. Family pride and pride in his father (for he is very proud of what his father was) have caused this. The powerful motive is not to appear to disgrace his family, to decline from the admirable qualities, or lose the standing of the Pemberley House. He also possesses brotherly pride, which, along with some brotherly affection, makes him a very kind and careful guardian of his sister; you will generally hear him highly praised as the most attentive and best of brothers.\" \"What kind of girl is Miss Darcy?\" Elizabeth inquired. He shook his head. \"I wish I could call her amiable. It pains me to speak ill of a Darcy, but she is too much like her brother—very, very proud. As a child, she was affectionate, pleasant, and extremely fond of me; I spent countless hours entertaining her. But she means nothing to me now.

If Mr. Darcy’s father hadn’t cared for me so much, his son might have tolerated me better. But since his father was so attached to me, it angered Mr. Darcy from an early age. He couldn’t stand the sense of competition between us or how I was often preferred.\"\n\nElizabeth admitted, \"I didn’t realize Mr. Darcy was capable of such things. I never liked him, but I didn’t think so badly of him—I thought he merely looked down on others, not that he could stoop to such harsh revenge, unfairness, and cruelty!\"\n\nAfter a moment’s thought, she continued, \"I do recall him bragging one day at Netherfield about how he never forgives and how he holds grudges.

My father began in the same line of work as your uncle, Mr. Philips, but eventually he dedicated himself to serving the late Mr. Darcy and managing Pemberley. Mr. Darcy valued him greatly and trusted him completely. Mr. Darcy himself often admitted he owed my father much because of his hard work. Right before my father died, Mr. Darcy promised him he’d take care of me, and I believe he felt he owed it as much out of gratitude as out of affection.\"\n\nElizabeth cried, \"How awful! I’m surprised Mr. Darcy’s pride hasn’t at least kept him honest with you. Even if only out of pride—because I must call this dishonesty.\"\n\nWickham agreed, \"It is surprising, because most of what he does comes from his pride, and sometimes pride has been his saving grace. It’s led him towards virtue more than anything else.

His pride in his family and his father are strong reasons. He doesn’t want to bring shame to his family or lose the respect tied to Pemberley House. He’s also a proud brother, and with this pride and some brotherly affection, he is a very attentive guardian to his sister. Most people praise him as an excellent and caring brother.\"\n\nElizabeth then asked, \"What is Miss Darcy like?\"\n\nHe shook his head and replied, \"I wish I could say she was likable. I hate to speak poorly of a Darcy, but she is too much like her brother—extremely proud. As a child, she was loving and delightful and very fond of me; I would spend hours entertaining her. But now, she means nothing to me. She is a pretty girl of fifteen or sixteen and very well-accomplished.

She has the reputation of being remarkably sensible and clever; but I rather believe she derives part of her abilities from her rank and fortune, part from her authoritative manner, and the rest from the pride of her nephew, who chooses that everyone connected with him should have an understanding of the first class.”\nElizabeth allowed that he had given a very rational account of it, and they continued talking together with mutual satisfaction till supper put an end to cards, and gave the rest of the ladies their share of Mr. Wickham’s attentions. There could be no conversation in the noise of Mrs. Philips’s supper party, but his manners recommended him to everybody. Whatever he said, was said well; and whatever he did, done gracefully.

Lydia talked incessantly of lottery tickets, of the fish she had lost and the fish she had won; and Mr. Collins, in describing the civility of Mr. and Mrs. Philips, protesting that he did not in the least regard his losses at whist, enumerating all the dishes at supper, and repeatedly fearing that he crowded his cousins, had more to say than he could well manage before the carriage stopped at Longbourn House.",

Elizabeth remarked that Mr. Collins spoke very highly of both Lady Catherine and her daughter. However, based on certain details he had shared about Lady Catherine, Elizabeth suspected that his gratitude was making him overlook her flaws and that, despite being his patroness, she was an arrogant and conceited woman. Wickham fully agreed, stating he hadn't seen her in many years but clearly remembered disliking her due to her overbearing and disrespectful manners. He acknowledged her reputation for being notably sensible and intelligent but suggested that her perceived cleverness was partly due to her high status and wealth, partly to her authoritative style, and the rest a reflection of her nephew's pride, who insisted that all his connections be considered highly intelligent. Elizabeth conceded that he had provided a very logical explanation, and they continued to converse pleasurably until supper was announced, bringing the card game to a close and allowing the other ladies a chance to engage with Mr. Wickham. The noise at Mrs. Philips's supper party made quiet conversation impossible, but his agreeable manners charmed everyone present. Everything he said was well-expressed, and everything he did was done gracefully. Elizabeth departed feeling completely preoccupied with thoughts of him.

Lydia chatted incessantly about lottery tickets and her wins and losses at cards, while Mr. Collins described Mr. and Mrs. Philips's politeness, insisted his whist losses were insignificant, listed all the supper dishes, and repeatedly expressed concern about his cousins being crowded, speaking so much that he could barely finish before the carriage arrived at Longbourn House.",

Elizabeth remarked that while Mr. Collins had much praise for Lady Catherine and her daughter, she suspected his thankfulness for their support made him overlook Lady Catherine's faults; Elizabeth believed that Lady Catherine was actually proud and self-important. Wickham agreed, confirming her opinion, saying he hadn't seen Lady Catherine in years but remembered never liking her; he thought her behavior was overbearing and rude. Though she was said to be smart and talented, Wickham believed that much of her perceived ability came from her wealth, status, and commanding manner, as well as the pride of her nephew, Darcy, who wished all his connections to seem remarkable. Elizabeth thought Wickham's explanation was sensible, and the two enjoyed a pleasant conversation until the card games ended and supper began, giving the other ladies the chance to interact with Wickham, whose charm and graceful behavior impressed everyone. As Elizabeth left, she found her thoughts dwell entirely on Wickham and what he had shared with her, but on the journey home she had no opportunity to speak of him, since Lydia chattered nonstop about lottery tickets and her luck at fish, while Mr. Collins went on about the hospitality of their hosts, his losses at cards, the supper dishes, and repeatedly worrying about inconveniencing his cousins, all before they finally arrived back at Longbourn."

Jane listened with astonishment and concern: she knew not how to believe that Mr. Darcy could be so unworthy of Mr. Bingley’s regard; and yet it was not in her nature to question the veracity of a young man of such amiable appearance as Wickham. The possibility of his having really endured such unkindness was enough to interest all her tender feelings; and nothing therefore remained to be done but to think well of them both, to defend the conduct of each, and throw into the account of accident or mistake whatever could not be otherwise explained.\n“They have both,” said she, “been deceived, I dare say, in some way or other, of which we can form no idea. Interested people have perhaps misrepresented each to the other. It is, in short, impossible for us to conjecture the causes or circumstances which may have alienated them, without actual blame on either side.”\n“Very true, indeed; and now, my dear Jane, what have you got to say in behalf of the interested people who have probably been concerned in the business? Do clear them, too, or we shall be obliged to think ill of somebody.”\n“Laugh as much as you choose, but you will not laugh me out of my opinion. My dearest Lizzy, do but consider in what a disgraceful light it places Mr. Darcy, to be treating his father’s favourite in such a manner,—one whom his father had promised to provide for. It is impossible. No man of common humanity, no man who had any value for his character, could be capable of it. Can his most intimate friends be so excessively deceived in him? Oh no.”\n“I can much more easily believe Mr. Bingley’s being imposed on than that Mr. Wickham should invent such a history of himself as he gave me last night; names, facts, everything mentioned without ceremony. If it be not so, let Mr. Darcy contradict it. Besides, there was truth in his looks.”\n“It is difficult, indeed—it is distressing. One does not know what to think.”\n“I beg your pardon;—one knows exactly what to think.”\nBut Jane could think with certainty on only one point,—that Mr. Bingley, if he had been imposed on, would have much to suffer when the affair became public.",

Jane was filled with surprise and worry upon hearing it; she found it hard to accept that Mr. Darcy could be so undeserving of Mr. Bingley’s good opinion. However, her nature made it impossible for her to doubt the sincerity of a young man as pleasant-seeming as Wickham. The possibility that he had genuinely experienced such mistreatment was enough to engage all her compassionate feelings. Consequently, her only course of action was to think favorably of both men, excuse their respective behaviors, and attribute anything otherwise inexplicable to chance or error.\n“They have both, I’m sure, been misled in some way we can’t imagine,” she proposed. “Perhaps manipulative individuals have misrepresented each to the other. In short, it’s impossible for us to guess the reasons or circumstances that have estranged them, without necessarily faulting either party.”\n“How very true,” Elizabeth replied. “And now, my dear Jane, what explanation do you have for the potentially meddlesome people likely involved in this matter? Please clear them too, or we’ll be forced to think poorly of someone!”\nJane responded, “Laugh all you want, but you won’t make me abandon my viewpoint. My dearest Lizzy, just consider how scandalous it makes Mr. Darcy appear, treating his father’s favourite in such a manner—someone his father had promised to look after. It’s unthinkable. No person with basic human kindness, no one concerned with their reputation, could do such a thing. Could his closest friends really be that completely mistaken about him? Oh, no.”\nElizabeth countered, “I find it far easier to believe Mr. Bingley was deceived than that Mr. Wickham would invent such a detailed personal history as he told me last night; names, events, everything mentioned without hesitation. If it’s not true, let Mr. Darcy deny it. Besides, his appearance seemed to confirm his words.”\n“It is truly difficult—it’s upsetting. One doesn’t know what conclusion to reach,” Jane sighed.\n“I disagree,” Elizabeth said. “One knows precisely what to think.”\nHowever, Jane could only feel certain about one thing: that if Mr. Bingley had been deceived, he would suffer greatly when the truth eventually became known.",

Jane listened, surprised and worried, unsure how to believe that Mr. Darcy could be so undeserving of Mr. Bingley's friendship, yet at the same time unwilling to doubt the honesty of someone as pleasant as Wickham. The idea that Wickham might truly have suffered such mistreatment touched her deeply, so all she could do was to think favorably of both men, defend each of them, and attribute anything unexplained to misunderstandings or accidents. Jane remarked that both men had probably been misled somehow, perhaps by others who misrepresented them, and that it was impossible for them to guess the true causes of the disagreement without blaming anyone. Elizabeth teased Jane for always wanting to think well of everyone, joking that if Jane kept it up, they'd never think badly of anyone at all. Jane replied that Elizabeth's laughter would not change her mind. She found it impossible to believe that Mr. Darcy could treat his father's favorite so poorly, especially when his late father had promised to care for him, insisting that no decent person would act that way and that Mr. Darcy's friends could not be so wrong about him. Elizabeth responded that she could more easily believe Mr. Bingley had been misled than that Wickham could have invented such detailed stories as he told her, pointing out that there was sincerity in his manner. Both sisters admitted the situation was confusing and upsetting, and Jane was certain only that if Mr. Bingley had been deceived, he would suffer greatly when the truth came out."

Elizabeth made no answer, and took her place in the set, amazed at the dignity to which she was arrived in being allowed to stand opposite to Mr. Darcy, and reading in her neighbours’ looks their equal amazement in beholding it. They stood for some time without speaking a word; and she began to imagine that their silence was to last through the two dances, and, at first, was resolved not to break it; till suddenly fancying that it would be the greater punishment to her partner to oblige him to talk, she made some slight observation on the dance. He replied, and was again silent. After a pause of some minutes, she addressed him a second time, with—\n“It is your turn to say something now, Mr. Darcy. I talked about the dance, and you ought to make some kind of remark on the size of the room, or the number of couples.”\nHe smiled, and assured her that whatever she wished him to say should be said.\n“Very well; that reply will do for the present. Perhaps, by-and-by, I may observe that private balls are much pleasanter than public ones; but now we may be silent.”\n“Do you talk by rule, then, while you are dancing?”\n“Sometimes. One must speak a little, you know. It would look odd to be entirely silent for half an hour together; and yet, for the advantage of some, conversation ought to be so arranged as that they may have the trouble of saying as little as possible.”\n“Are you consulting your own feelings in the present case, or do you imagine that you are gratifying mine?”\n“Both,” replied Elizabeth archly; “for I have always seen a great similarity in the turn of our minds. We are each of an unsocial, taciturn disposition, unwilling to speak, unless we expect to say something that will amaze the whole room, and be handed down to posterity with all the éclat of a proverb.”\n“This is no very striking resemblance of your own character, I am sure,” said he. “How near it may be to mine, I cannot pretend to say. You think it a faithful portrait, undoubtedly.”\n“I must not decide on my own performance.”\nHe made no answer; and they were again silent till they had gone down the dance, when he asked her if she and her sisters did not very often walk to Meryton. She answered in the affirmative; and, unable to resist the temptation, added, “When you met us there the other day, we had just been forming a new acquaintance.”\nThe effect was immediate. A deeper shade of hauteur overspread his features, but he said not a word; and Elizabeth, though blaming herself for her own weakness, could not go on. At length Darcy spoke, and in a constrained manner said,—\n“Mr. Wickham is blessed with such happy manners as may insure his making friends; whether he may be equally capable of retaining them, is less certain.”\n“He has been so unlucky as to lose your friendship,” replied Elizabeth, with emphasis, “and in a manner which he is likely to suffer from all his life.”\nDarcy made no answer, and seemed desirous of changing the subject. At that moment Sir William Lucas appeared close to them, meaning to pass through the set to the other side of the room; but, on perceiving Mr. Darcy, he stopped, with a bow of superior courtesy, to compliment him on his dancing and his partner.\n“I have been most highly gratified, indeed, my dear sir; such very superior dancing is not often seen. It is evident that you belong to the first circles. Allow me to say, however, that your fair partner does not disgrace you: and that I must hope to have this pleasure often repeated, especially when a certain desirable event, my dear Miss Eliza (glancing at her sister and Bingley), shall take place. What congratulations will then flow in! I appeal to Mr. Darcy;—but let me not interrupt you, sir. You will not thank me for detaining you from the bewitching converse of that young lady, whose bright eyes are also upbraiding me.”\nThe latter part of this address was scarcely heard by Darcy; but Sir William’s allusion to his friend seemed to strike him forcibly, and his eyes were directed, with a very serious expression, towards Bingley and Jane, who were dancing together. Recovering himself, however, shortly, he turned to his partner, and said,—\n“Sir William’s interruption has made me forget what we were talking of.”\n“I do not think we were speaking at all. Sir William could not have interrupted any two people in the room who had less to say for themselves. We have tried two or three subjects already without success, and what we are to talk of next I cannot imagine.”\n“What think you of books?” said he, smiling.\n“Books—oh no!—I am sure we never read the same, or not with the same feelings.”\n“I am sorry you think so; but if that be the case, there can at least be no want of subject. We may compare our different opinions.”\n“No—I cannot talk of books in a ball-room; my head is always full of something else.”\n“The present always occupies you in such scenes—does it?” said he, with a look of doubt.\n“Yes, always,” she replied, without knowing what she said; for her thoughts had wandered far from the subject, as soon afterwards appeared by her suddenly exclaiming, “I remember hearing you once say, Mr. Darcy, that you hardly ever forgave;—that your resentment, once created, was unappeasable. You are very cautious, I suppose, as to its being created?”\n“I am,” said he, with a firm voice.\n“And never allow yourself to be blinded by prejudice?”\n“I hope not.”\n“It is particularly incumbent on those who never change their opinion, to be secure of judging properly at first.”\n“May I ask to what these questions tend?”\n“Merely to the illustration of your character,” said she, endeavouring to shake off her gravity. “I am trying to make it out.”\n“And what is your success?”\nShe shook her head. “I do not get on at all. I hear such different accounts of you as puzzle me exceedingly.”\n“I can readily believe,” answered he, gravely, “that reports may vary greatly with respect to me; and I could wish, Miss Bennet, that you were not to sketch my character at the present moment, as there is reason to fear that the performance would reflect no credit on either.”\n“But if I do not take your likeness now, I may never have another opportunity.”\n“I would by no means suspend any pleasure of yours,” he coldly replied. She said no more, and they went down the other dance and parted in silence; on each side dissatisfied, though not to an equal degree; for in Darcy’s breast there was a tolerably powerful feeling towards her, which soon procured her pardon, and directed all his anger against another.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "When the dancing resumed and Darcy approached to claim her hand, Charlotte discreetly warned Elizabeth not to act foolishly and let her affection for Wickham make her appear disagreeable in the eyes of a man of Darcy's importance. Elizabeth made no reply, taking her spot in the dance line, astonished by the significance of being positioned opposite Mr. Darcy and observing the equal astonishment on the faces of their neighbors. They remained silent for a time, and she began to think their quiet would last through both dances, initially deciding not to break it. However, she then conceived that forcing him to talk would be a greater inconvenience for him, so she made a brief remark about the dance. He responded, but was silent again. After a few minutes of quiet, she spoke to him a second time, saying, \"Mr. Darcy, it's your turn to speak now. I commented on the dance, and you should make a observation about the size of the room or the number of dancers.\" He smiled and assured her that whatever she wished him to say would be said. \"Very well; that answer will suffice for the moment. Perhaps later I might note that private balls are much more agreeable than public ones, but for now, we can be silent.\" He asked if she had rules for conversation while dancing. \"Sometimes. One must speak a little, you know. It would seem strange to be completely silent for half an hour straight; and yet, for the benefit of some individuals, conversation should be structured so they have to say as little as possible.\" \"Are you considering your own feelings in this situation, or do you believe you are pleasing mine?\" Elizabeth replied cheekily, \"Both, as I have always perceived a great similarity in our mental dispositions. We are both reserved and quiet by nature, reluctant to speak unless we expect to say something that will amaze everyone and be remembered for generations with the prestige of a famous saying.\" \"That is certainly not a very accurate depiction of your own character,\" he said. \"How close it might be to mine, I cannot claim to know. You unquestionably consider it a true likeness.\" \"I must not evaluate my own work.\" He did not respond, and they were silent again until they had completed the dance down the set, when he asked if she and her sisters walked to Meryton frequently. She confirmed that they did and, unable to resist the urge, added, \"When you encountered us there the other day, we had just made a new acquaintance.\" The effect was immediate. His face took on a deeper look of arrogance, but he said nothing, and Elizabeth, although critical of her own impulsiveness, could not continue. At last, Darcy spoke, saying in a stiff manner, \"Mr. Wickham possesses such pleasant manners that they guarantee he will make friends; whether he is equally capable of keeping them is less certain.\" \"He has been so unfortunate as to lose your friendship,\" Elizabeth responded emphatically, \"and in a way that is likely to cause him suffering for his entire life.\" Darcy made no reply and appeared to want to change the subject. Just then, Sir William Lucas appeared nearby, intending to pass through the dance set. However, upon seeing Mr. Darcy, he stopped, bowing with great politeness, to commend his dancing and his partner. \"I have been extremely delighted indeed, my dear sir; such exceptionally fine dancing is not often seen. It is clear that you belong to the highest society. Allow me to say, however, that your lovely partner is not unworthy of you, and I must hope to have this pleasure often repeated, especially when a certain desirable event, my dear Miss Eliza (looking towards her sister and Bingley), shall take place. What expressions of congratulations will then flood in! I appeal to Mr. Darcy; - but let me not interrupt you, sir. You will not thank me for keeping you from the captivating conversation of that young lady, whose bright eyes also seem to be reproaching me.\" Darcy barely heard the latter part of this speech, but Sir William's reference to his friend seemed to strike him forcefully, and he looked with a very serious expression towards Bingley and Jane, who were dancing together. Quickly recovering himself, however, he turned to his partner and said, \"Sir William's interruption has caused me to forget what we were discussing.\" \"I don't think we were talking at all. Sir William could not have interrupted any two people in the room who had less to say for themselves. We have attempted two or three topics already without success, and I have no idea what we should talk about next.\" \"What are your thoughts on books?\" he suggested, smiling. \"Books - oh dear, no! - I am sure we never read the same ones, or at least not with the same sentiments.\" \"I regret that you think so; but if that is the case, there can at least be no shortage of subject. We can compare our differing opinions.\" \"No - I cannot discuss books at a ball; my mind is always preoccupied with other things.\" \"The present moment always occupies you in such settings, does it?\" he asked, with a look of skepticism. \"Yes, always,\" she replied, without fully knowing what she said, as her thoughts had drifted far from the subject. This became clear shortly after when she suddenly exclaimed, \"Mr. Darcy, I remember hearing you say once that you hardly ever forgive - that your resentment, once formed, was relentless. You are very cautious, I presume, about it being formed?\" \"I am,\" he said firmly. \"And you never allow yourself to be misled by prejudice?\" \"I hope not.\" \"It is particularly important for those who never change their minds to be certain they judge correctly from the outset.\" \"May I ask what these questions are leading to?\" he inquired. \"Simply to illustrate your character,\" she said, trying to lighten the mood. \"I am attempting to figure it out.\" \"And how successful are you?\" She shook her head. \"I am not progressing at all. I hear such varying accounts of you that they confuse me greatly.\" He replied gravely, \"I can easily believe that reports about me may differ considerably, Miss Bennet, and I would wish you did not attempt to depict my character at this moment, as there is reason to fear the result would not reflect well on either of us.\" \"But if I do not capture your likeness now,\" she said, \"I may never have another chance.\" \"I would certainly not postpone any pleasure of yours,\" he replied coolly. She said nothing more, and they finished the rest of the dance and parted in silence. Both were dissatisfied, though not to the same degree, for in Darcy's heart there was a quite strong feeling towards her, which quickly granted her pardon and directed all his displeasure towards someone else.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "As the dancing began again, Darcy approached Elizabeth to claim her for the next dance. Charlotte quietly warned Elizabeth not to let her infatuation with Wickham make her seem disagreeable to someone as important as Darcy. Elizabeth said nothing and joined the dance set, surprised at her unexpected elevation—dancing opposite Mr. Darcy—and noticing that others were just as astonished to see the pairing. They stood in silence for a while, and Elizabeth almost decided not to speak at all, but then thought it would be more awkward for Darcy if she made him talk, so she made a small comment about the dance. Darcy replied but quickly fell silent again. After some minutes, Elizabeth spoke to him once more, teasing that it was his turn to say something—perhaps to comment on the size of the room or the number of dancers. He smiled and said he would say whatever she wished. She replied that his answer would do for now; perhaps later she’d remark on the pleasures of private versus public balls, but for the moment, silence was acceptable. Darcy asked if she always had rules for talking while dancing. Elizabeth said one had to speak a little so as not to seem odd by being silent for half an hour, although for some, conversations should be kept as minimal as possible. Darcy asked if she was considering her own feelings or his, and Elizabeth jokingly answered both, suggesting they were both quiet types who only spoke if they had something profound to say. Darcy doubted the description fit Elizabeth but wasn’t sure about himself, saying she must think it an accurate portrayal. Elizabeth said she couldn’t judge her own performance. They lapsed back into silence until they finished the dance, when Darcy asked if she and her sisters often walked to Meryton. She replied yes, and, unable to resist, added that when Darcy had seen them there recently, they had just met a new acquaintance, implying Wickham. Darcy’s expression grew colder but he said nothing, and Elizabeth, regretting her comment, didn’t pursue the topic. After a pause, Darcy constrainedly remarked that Mr. Wickham’s friendly manner made him popular, though it was less certain he could keep friendships. Elizabeth replied that Wickham had unfortunately lost Darcy’s friendship in a way that would affect him for life. Darcy didn’t respond and seemed to want to change the topic. Just then, Sir William Lucas came over, complimenting Darcy on his dancing and Elizabeth as a partner, and hinting at a future marriage between Bingley and Jane. Sir William’s comment seemed to startle Darcy, who looked seriously at Bingley and Jane. Regaining composure, he told Elizabeth he’d forgotten what they were talking about. Elizabeth replied they’d hardly spoken at all—Sir William couldn’t have interrupted two people with less to say. Darcy suggested books as a topic, but Elizabeth declined, saying they never read the same books or felt the same about them. Darcy suggested that differences in opinion gave them something to discuss, but Elizabeth insisted she never talked about books at balls since she was too distracted. Darcy, skeptical, asked if she was always occupied by the present moment at such events, and Elizabeth absently agreed, her mind already wandering. Suddenly, she recalled Darcy once saying he rarely forgave and that his resentment was lasting. She asked if he was cautious in creating resentments. Darcy affirmed he was. Elizabeth asked if he was ever blinded by prejudice; Darcy hoped he was not. Elizabeth pointed out that those who never change their opinions should be sure they are judging correctly to begin with. Darcy wanted to know the point of her questions, and Elizabeth explained she was trying to understand his character, though without success, since opinions about him varied so much. Darcy replied seriously that reports did differ and hoped Elizabeth wouldn’t try to form an opinion right then, as the outcome would be unflattering for both of them. Elizabeth joked that if she didn’t attempt now, she might never get another chance. Darcy coldly replied he didn’t want to deprive her of any pleasure. They finished the dance in silence and parted, both dissatisfied—though Darcy’s dissatisfaction was less, as his feelings for Elizabeth quickly led him to forgive her and instead turn his anger elsewhere."

Your sister has been talking to me about him, and asking me a thousand questions; and I find that the young man forgot to tell you, among his other communications, that he was the son of old Wickham, the late Mr. Darcy’s steward. Let me recommend you, however, as a friend, not to give implicit confidence to all his assertions; for, as to Mr. Darcy’s using him ill, it is perfectly false: for, on the contrary, he has been always remarkably kind to him, though George Wickham has treated Mr. Darcy in a most infamous manner. I do not know the particulars, but I know very well that Mr. Darcy is not in the least to blame; that he cannot bear to hear George Wickham mentioned; and that though my brother thought he could not well avoid including him in his invitation to the officers, he was excessively glad to find that he had taken himself out of the way. His coming into the country at all is a most insolent thing, indeed, and I wonder how he could presume to do it. I pity you, Miss Eliza, for this discovery of your favourite’s guilt; but really, considering his descent, one could not expect much better.”\n“His guilt and his descent appear, by your account, to be the same,” said Elizabeth, angrily; “for I have heard you accuse him of nothing worse than of being the son of Mr. Darcy’s steward, and of that, I can assure you, he informed me himself.”\n“I beg your pardon,” replied Miss Bingley, turning away with a sneer. “Excuse my interference; it was kindly meant.”\n“Insolent girl!” said Elizabeth to herself. “You are much mistaken if you expect to influence me by such a paltry attack as this.

She began by saying she had heard Elizabeth was very pleased with George Wickham, as her sister had been questioning her extensively about him. Miss Bingley then revealed that Wickham had apparently failed to mention, among other things, that he was the son of old Wickham, the former steward for the late Mr. Darcy. Miss Bingley advised Elizabeth, purportedly as a friend, not to fully believe everything Wickham claimed. She insisted that Wickham's assertion of Mr. Darcy treating him poorly was completely untrue; on the contrary, she stated that Darcy had always been remarkably kind to him, while George Wickham had behaved outrageously towards Mr. Darcy. Though she didn't know the specifics, she was certain Mr. Darcy bore no fault whatsoever, that he couldn't stand to hear Wickham's name, and that despite her brother feeling obligated to include him in the officer's invitation, he was immensely relieved when Wickham didn't attend. Miss Bingley added that Wickham's mere presence in the country was incredibly arrogant, and she couldn't believe he dared to do it. She ended by expressing pity for Elizabeth's discovery of her 'favourite's' wrongdoing, but suggested that given his background, one couldn't really expect much more. Elizabeth retorted angrily that, according to Miss Bingley's account, his 'guilt' and his 'descent' seemed identical, as Miss Bingley had accused him of nothing worse than being the steward's son, a fact Elizabeth assured her Wickham himself had shared. Miss Bingley replied with a sneer, turning away, saying, \"I beg your pardon. Excuse my interference; it was kindly meant.\" Elizabeth muttered to herself, \"Insolent girl! You are quite mistaken if you think such a petty attack as this will sway me. I see nothing in it but your own deliberate ignorance and Mr. Darcy's malice.\"",

Your sister has been telling me about him and asking many questions. However, it seems Wickham neglected to mention to you that he is the son of old Wickham, who served as the late Mr. Darcy’s steward. As a friend, let me advise you not to trust everything he says; for, contrary to his claims that Mr. Darcy mistreated him, it is entirely untrue. In fact, Mr. Darcy has always been especially good to him, while Wickham has behaved very badly toward him. I do not know the details, but I can assure you that Mr. Darcy bears no fault; he cannot even stand to hear Wickham’s name mentioned. And although my brother felt obliged to invite him with the officers, he was extremely relieved when Wickham did not attend. It is quite presumptuous of Wickham to come to the neighborhood at all, and I am surprised he dared. I sympathize with you, Miss Eliza, for learning about your favourite’s wrongdoings; but, given his background, one could hardly expect much better from him.\" \n\nElizabeth retorted, upset, \"According to you, his wrongdoing and his family background are the same; you have accused him of nothing except being the steward’s son, which he already told me himself.\"\n\nMiss Bingley responded, turning away with a sneer, \"I apologize; please pardon me for interfering. I meant it kindly.\"\n\nIndignantly, Elizabeth thought, \"How insolent! If you think you can sway me with such a petty attack, you are very much mistaken. I see only your own stubborn ignorance and Mr. Darcy’s malice in this.\""

I am afraid he has been very imprudent, and has deserved to lose Mr. Darcy’s regard.”\n“Mr. Bingley does not know Mr. Wickham himself.”\n“No; he never saw him till the other morning at Meryton.”\n“This account then is what he has received from Mr. Darcy.

Elizabeth immediately understood how she felt, and at that moment, her worry for Wickham, her anger towards his enemies, and everything else became less important than the hope that Jane was on the path to happiness. 'I want to know,' she said, smiling just as much as her sister, 'what you found out about Mr. Wickham. But perhaps you were too happily occupied to think about anyone else, in which case, I completely forgive you.' 'No,' Jane replied, 'I haven't forgotten him, but I don't have good news. Mr. Bingley doesn't know the complete story about him and is unaware of the specific things that primarily upset Mr. Darcy. However, he assures me of his friend's integrity, honesty, and honourable behaviour. He is completely convinced that Mr. Wickham deserved much less favour from Mr. Darcy than he received. And I regret to say that according to both Mr. Bingley and his sister, Mr. Wickham is definitely not a respectable young man. I fear he acted very carelessly and deserved to lose Mr. Darcy's good opinion.' 'But Mr. Bingley doesn't know Mr. Wickham personally,' Elizabeth pointed out. 'No,' Jane confirmed, 'he didn't meet him until the other morning in Meryton.' 'So this information comes from Mr. Darcy?' Elizabeth said. 'I understand completely now.'

Elizabeth listened with delight to the happy though modest hopes which Jane entertained of Bingley’s regard, and said all in her power to heighten her confidence in it. On their being joined by Mr. Bingley himself, Elizabeth withdrew to Miss Lucas; to whose inquiry after the pleasantness of her last partner she had scarcely replied, before Mr. Collins came up to them, and told her with great exultation, that he had just been so fortunate as to make a most important discovery.\n“I have found out,” said he, “by a singular accident, that there is now in the room a near relation to my patroness. I happened to overhear the gentleman himself mentioning to the young lady who does the honours of this house the names of his cousin Miss De Bourgh, and of her mother, Lady Catherine. How wonderfully these sort of things occur! Who would have thought of my meeting with—perhaps—a nephew of Lady Catherine de Bourgh in this assembly! I am most thankful that the discovery is made in time for me to pay my respects to him, which I am now going to do, and trust he will excuse my not having done it before. My total ignorance of the connection must plead my apology.”\n“You are not going to introduce yourself to Mr. Darcy?”\n“Indeed I am. I shall entreat his pardon for not having done it earlier. I believe him to be Lady Catherine’s nephew. It will be in my power to assure him that her Ladyship was quite well yesterday se’nnight.”\nElizabeth tried hard to dissuade him from such a scheme; assuring him that Mr. Darcy would consider his addressing him without introduction as an impertinent freedom, rather than a compliment to his aunt; that it was not in the least necessary there should be any notice on either side, and that if it were, it must belong to Mr. Darcy, the superior in consequence, to begin the acquaintance. Mr. Collins listened to her with the determined air of following his own inclination, and when she ceased speaking, replied thus,—\n“My dear Miss Elizabeth, I have the highest opinion in the world of your excellent judgment in all matters within the scope of your understanding, but permit me to say that there must be a wide difference between the established forms of ceremony amongst the laity and those which regulate the clergy; for, give me leave to observe that I consider the clerical office as equal in point of dignity with the highest rank in the kingdom—provided that a proper humility of behaviour is at the same time maintained. You must, therefore, allow me to follow the dictates of my conscience on this occasion, which lead me to perform what I look on as a point of duty. Pardon me for neglecting to profit by your advice, which on every other subject shall be my constant guide, though in the case before us I consider myself more fitted by education and habitual study to decide on what is right than a young lady like yourself;” and with a low bow he left her to attack Mr. Darcy, whose reception of his advances she eagerly watched, and whose astonishment at being so addressed was very evident. Her cousin prefaced his speech with a solemn bow, and though she could not hear a word of it, she felt as if hearing it all, and saw in the motion of his lips the words “apology,” “Hunsford,” and “Lady Catherine de Bourgh.” It vexed her to see him expose himself to such a man. Mr. Darcy was eyeing him with unrestrained wonder; and when at last Mr. Collins allowed him to speak, replied with an air of distant civility. Mr. Collins, however, was not discouraged from speaking again, and Mr. Darcy’s contempt seemed abundantly increasing with the length of his second speech; and at the end of it he only made him a slight bow, and moved another way: Mr. Collins then returned to Elizabeth.\n“I have no reason, I assure you,” said he, “to be dissatisfied with my reception. Mr. Darcy seemed much pleased with the attention. He answered me with the utmost civility, and even paid me the compliment of saying, that he was so well convinced of Lady Catherine’s discernment as to be certain she could never bestow a favour unworthily. It was really a very handsome thought. Upon the whole, I am much pleased with him.”",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "She then shifted their discussion to a topic more agreeable to both, on which their feelings were in complete agreement. Elizabeth listened with pleasure to Jane's hopeful yet modest expectations regarding Bingley's affection, and did her best to strengthen her confidence in it. When Mr. Bingley joined them, Elizabeth moved away to join Miss Lucas. She had barely finished responding to Miss Lucas's question about her previous dance partner when Mr. Collins approached, announcing with great enthusiasm that he had just made a very significant discovery. \"I have found out,\" he declared, \"by a strange coincidence, that a close relative of my esteemed patroness is currently in the room. I happened to overhear the gentleman himself mentioning his cousin Miss De Bourgh and her mother, Lady Catherine, to the young woman of the house. How remarkably these things happen! Who could have imagined I would encounter—perhaps—a nephew of Lady Catherine de Bourgh at this gathering! I am profoundly grateful this discovery was made in time for me to pay my respects to him, which I am about to do. I trust he will pardon my not having done so sooner. My complete ignorance of the connection must serve as my excuse.\" \"You are not going to introduce yourself to Mr. Darcy, are you?\" she asked. \"Indeed I am. I shall implore his forgiveness for the delay. I am convinced he is Lady Catherine's nephew. I will be able to assure him her Ladyship was quite well a week ago.\" Elizabeth strenuously attempted to discourage him from this plan, insisting that Mr. Darcy would perceive his unsolicited address as an inappropriate liberty rather than a tribute to his aunt; that there was absolutely no need for either person to acknowledge the other, and that if any acknowledgment were necessary, it was the superior Mr. Darcy's place to initiate the acquaintance. Mr. Collins listened with a clear resolve to follow his own inclination. When she finished speaking, he replied, \"My dear Miss Elizabeth, I hold the highest possible opinion of your excellent judgment in all matters within the range of your understanding, but allow me to say there must be a considerable difference between the established customs of society for ordinary people and those that govern the clergy. For, permit me to point out, I consider the role of the clergyman to be equal in dignity to the highest status in the kingdom—provided that appropriate humility in conduct is simultaneously maintained. You must, therefore, permit me to act according to the dictates of my conscience in this situation, which compel me to perform what I see as a matter of duty. Forgive me for declining to benefit from your counsel, which shall be my constant guide on every other subject, though in the present case I consider myself better equipped by education and constant study to determine what is right than a young lady such as yourself.\" With a low bow, he left her to confront Mr. Darcy, whose reception of his approach she eagerly observed. Darcy's astonishment at being addressed in this manner was quite evident. Her cousin began his address with a formal bow, and although she could not hear his words, she felt as if she heard them all, detecting the words \"apology,\" \"Hunsford,\" and \"Lady Catherine de Bourgh\" in the movement of his lips. It displeased her to see him expose himself to such a person. Mr. Darcy was staring at him with undisguised amazement. When Mr. Collins finally paused, allowing Mr. Darcy to speak, he replied with an air of distant civility. Mr. Collins, however, was not deterred from speaking again, and Mr. Darcy's disdain appeared to intensify considerably with the length of his second speech. At its conclusion, he simply gave him a slight bow and moved away. Mr. Collins then returned to Elizabeth. \"I have no reason,\" he assured her, \"to be dissatisfied with how I was received. Mr. Darcy seemed very pleased with the attention. He responded with the utmost politeness and even complimented me by stating he was so certain of Lady Catherine's judgment that he was sure she would never bestow a favour undeservedly. That was truly a very gracious thought. On the whole, I am very pleased with him.\"",

When Mr. Bingley joined them, Elizabeth left to speak with Miss Lucas. Before Elizabeth could respond to Miss Lucas' question about her previous dance partner, Mr. Collins approached, excitedly declaring he had just made an important discovery. He explained that, quite by chance, he learned that a close relative of his esteemed patroness, Lady Catherine de Bourgh, was present at the event—he overheard someone mention Miss De Bourgh and Lady Catherine herself. Delighted by this coincidence, Mr. Collins announced his intention to pay his respects to Mr. Darcy, whom he believed to be Lady Catherine’s nephew, and apologized for not having done so sooner due to his ignorance of the connection.\n\nElizabeth tried to stop him, warning that Mr. Darcy might find such an unsolicited approach rude rather than flattering, and that any introductions should come from Mr. Darcy, given his higher social status. Mr. Collins, however, insisted on following his own sense of duty. He praised Elizabeth’s judgment, but claimed that, as a clergyman, the usual social rules did not strictly apply to him, and he felt compelled by principle to act. Politely disregarding Elizabeth’s advice, he went to introduce himself to Mr. Darcy, while Elizabeth anxiously watched the interaction. She could not hear the conversation but felt she knew what was being said, as she saw Mr. Collins make reference to Hunsford and Lady Catherine. Mr. Darcy appeared surprised and somewhat aloof, responding politely but with obvious reservation. Mr. Collins continued to speak enthusiastically, but Mr. Darcy grew even more disdainful, ultimately bowing slightly and moving away. Returning to Elizabeth, Mr. Collins insisted that he was pleased with how the meeting had gone, claiming Mr. Darcy was very civil, even flattering Lady Catherine’s good judgment in his response. Mr. Collins expressed overall satisfaction with the exchange."

She saw her in idea settled in that very house, in all the felicity which a marriage of true affection could bestow; and she felt capable, under such circumstances, of endeavouring even to like Bingley’s two sisters. Her mother’s thoughts she plainly saw were bent the same way, and she determined not to venture near her, lest she might hear too much. When they sat down to supper, therefore, she considered it a most unlucky perverseness which placed them within one of each other; and deeply was she vexed to find that her mother was talking to that one person (Lady Lucas) freely, openly, and of nothing else but of her expectation that Jane would be soon married to Mr. Bingley. It was an animating subject, and Mrs. Bennet seemed incapable of fatigue while enumerating the advantages of the match. His being such a charming young man, and so rich, and living but three miles from them, were the first points of self-gratulation; and then it was such a comfort to think how fond the two sisters were of Jane, and to be certain that they must desire the connection as much as she could do. It was, moreover, such a promising thing for her younger daughters, as Jane’s marrying so greatly must throw them in the way of other rich men; and, lastly, it was so pleasant at her time of life to be able to consign her single daughters to the care of their sister, that she might not be obliged to go into company more than she liked. It was necessary to make this circumstance a matter of pleasure, because on such occasions it is the etiquette; but no one was less likely than Mrs. Bennet to find comfort in staying at home at any period of her life. She concluded with many good wishes that Lady Lucas might soon be equally fortunate, though evidently and triumphantly believing there was no chance of it.\nIn vain did Elizabeth endeavour to check the rapidity of her mother’s words, or persuade her to describe her felicity in a less audible whisper; for to her inexpressible vexation she could perceive that the chief of it was overheard by Mr. Darcy, who sat opposite to them. Her mother only scolded her for being nonsensical.\n“What is Mr. Darcy to me, pray, that I should be afraid of him? I am sure we owe him no such particular civility as to be obliged to say nothing he may not like to hear.”\n“For heaven’s sake, madam, speak lower. What advantage can it be to you to offend Mr. Darcy? You will never recommend yourself to his friend by so doing.”\nNothing that she could say, however, had any influence. Her mother would talk of her views in the same intelligible tone. Elizabeth blushed and blushed again with shame and vexation. She could not help frequently glancing her eye at Mr. Darcy, though every glance convinced her of what she dreaded; for though he was not always looking at her mother, she was convinced that his attention was invariably fixed by her. The expression of his face changed gradually from indignant contempt to a composed and steady gravity.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "Since Elizabeth no longer had personal worries to focus on, she directed her attention almost entirely towards her sister and Mr. Bingley. The pleasant thoughts sparked by her observations made her nearly as joyful as Jane. She pictured Jane settled in that very house, experiencing the deep happiness that a truly affectionate marriage could bring. Under such circumstances, she felt she could even try to like Bingley’s two sisters. She could clearly see her mother's hopes were aligned with hers, and she decided to keep her distance to avoid hearing too much about it. Therefore, when they sat down for supper, she found it a truly unfortunate twist of fate that they were seated near each other. She was deeply annoyed to discover that her mother was speaking frankly and openly to the person beside her (Lady Lucas), talking about nothing but her certainty that Jane would soon marry Mr. Bingley. It was a lively topic, and Mrs. Bennet seemed tireless as she listed the benefits of the match. His being such a charming young man, so wealthy, and living only three miles away were the first points she boasted about. Then it was reassuring to think how fond Bingley’s sisters were of Jane and to be sure they desired the connection as much as she did. Furthermore, it was a promising prospect for her younger daughters, as Jane's marrying so well was bound to bring them into contact with other rich men. Lastly, she found it agreeable at her age to be able to entrust her unmarried daughters to their sister's care, so she wouldn't have to socialize more than she wished. It was necessary to present this situation positively, as it was the proper social custom on such occasions. However, Mrs. Bennet was less likely than anyone else to find satisfaction in staying home at any point in her life. She concluded by expressing many good wishes that Lady Lucas might soon be just as fortunate, though she clearly and confidently believed there was no possibility of it. Elizabeth's attempts to slow the speed of her mother’s words or convince her to whisper about her happiness were useless. To her immense annoyance, she realized that Mr. Darcy, who was sitting opposite them, was overhearing most of it. Her mother merely scolded her, calling her foolish. \"Why should I be afraid of Mr. Darcy?\" she asked. \"We are certainly not so obligated to be polite to him that we must avoid saying anything he might not like to hear.\" However, nothing Elizabeth said had any effect. Her mother continued discussing her plans in the same clearly audible voice. Elizabeth blushed repeatedly from shame and frustration. She couldn't help but frequently glance at Mr. Darcy, though each look confirmed her fears. Although he wasn't always looking directly at her mother, she was certain his attention was consistently focused on her. The expression on his face slowly changed from angry disdain to a calm and steady seriousness.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "Since Elizabeth no longer had personal goals to focus on, she directed her attention mostly to observing her sister Jane and Mr. Bingley. Watching them together filled her with pleasant thoughts that made her almost as content as Jane herself seemed. She imagined Jane happily settled in that very house, enjoying the bliss of a loving marriage, and under such happy circumstances, Elizabeth felt she could even try to like Bingley's sisters. She noticed that her mother was thinking along the same lines, so Elizabeth decided to keep her distance to avoid overhearing too much. Unfortunately, when it was time for supper, she found herself sitting uncomfortably close to her mother, who was busily and loudly telling Lady Lucas about her hopes for Jane's quick marriage to Mr. Bingley. Mrs. Bennet energetically listed all the benefits of the match—how charming and wealthy Bingley was, how conveniently he lived only three miles away, and how the affection between Jane and Bingley's sisters made the connection even more desirable. Mrs. Bennet also thought of how this marriage might help her younger daughters meet other eligible men, and how comforting it would be at her age to see her unmarried daughters placed under Jane's care so she wouldn't have to socialize more than she wanted. While etiquette required her to act pleased at the prospect of staying home, Mrs. Bennet was hardly one to actually enjoy such solitude. She finished by wishing Lady Lucas similar luck, though she felt sure such fortune would not come to her. \n\nElizabeth tried in vain to get her mother to speak more quietly or more discreetly about her happiness, especially since she noticed, with growing embarrassment, that Mr. Darcy, who was sitting across from them, could hear much of it. Mrs. Bennet, however, scolded Elizabeth for being silly and saw no reason to care about Mr. Darcy's opinion, insisting they owed him no special courtesy that would require them to keep quiet. Elizabeth pleaded with her to lower her voice, pointing out that offending Mr. Darcy would not help her gain favor with his friends, but her mother persisted in speaking just as audibly. This left Elizabeth repeatedly blushing from shame and distress, often glancing at Mr. Darcy, only to see her fears confirmed—though he wasn't always looking at Mrs. Bennet, Elizabeth was certain he was paying attention. Eventually, Darcy's expression shifted from annoyed disdain to a calm, serious composure."

          "text_segment": "At length, however, Mrs. Bennet had no more to say; and Lady Lucas, who had been long yawning at the repetition of delights which she saw no likelihood of sharing, was left to the comforts of cold ham and chicken. Elizabeth now began to revive. But not long was the interval of tranquillity; for when supper was over, singing was talked of, and she had the mortification of seeing Mary, after very little entreaty, preparing to oblige the company. By many significant looks and silent entreaties did she endeavour to prevent such a proof of complaisance,—but in vain; Mary would not understand them; such an opportunity of exhibiting was delightful to her, and she began her song. Elizabeth’s eyes were fixed on her, with most painful sensations; and she watched her progress through the several stanzas with an impatience which was very ill rewarded at their close; for Mary, on receiving amongst the thanks of the table the hint of a hope that she might be prevailed on to favour them again, after the pause of half a minute began another. Mary’s powers were by no means fitted for such a display; her voice was weak, and her manner affected. Elizabeth was in agonies. She looked at Jane to see how she bore it; but Jane was very composedly talking to Bingley. She looked at his two sisters, and saw them making signs of derision at each other, and at Darcy, who continued, however, impenetrably grave. She looked at her father to entreat his interference, lest Mary should be singing all night. He took the hint, and, when Mary had finished her second song, said aloud,—\n“That will do extremely well, child. You have delighted us long enough. Let the other young ladies have time to exhibit.”\nMary, though pretending not to hear, was somewhat disconcerted; and Elizabeth, sorry for her, and sorry for her father’s speech, was afraid her anxiety had done no good. Others of the party were now applied to.\n“If I,” said Mr. Collins, “were so fortunate as to be able to sing, I should have great pleasure, I am sure, in obliging the company with an air; for I consider music as a very innocent diversion, and perfectly compatible with the profession of a clergyman. I do not mean, however, to assert that we can be justified in devoting too much of our time to music, for there are certainly other things to be attended to. The rector of a parish has much to do. In the first place, he must make such an agreement for tithes as may be beneficial to himself and not offensive to his patron. He must write his own sermons; and the time that remains will not be too much for his parish duties, and the care and improvement of his dwelling, which he cannot be excused from making as comfortable as possible. And I do not think it of light importance that he should have attentive and conciliatory manners towards everybody, especially towards those to whom he owes his preferment. I cannot acquit him of that duty; nor could I think well of the man who should omit an occasion of testifying his respect towards anybody connected with the family.” And with a bow to Mr. Darcy, he concluded his speech, which had been spoken so loud as to be heard by half the room. Many stared—many smiled; but no one looked more amused than Mr. Bennet himself, while his wife seriously commended Mr. Collins for having spoken so sensibly, and observed, in a half-whisper to Lady Lucas, that he was a remarkably clever, good kind of young man.\nTo Elizabeth it appeared, that had her family made an agreement to expose themselves as much as they could during the evening, it would have been impossible for them to play their parts with more spirit, or finer success; and happy did she think it for Bingley and her sister that some of the exhibition had escaped his notice, and that his feelings were not of a sort to be much distressed by the folly which he must have witnessed. That his two sisters and Mr. Darcy, however, should have such an opportunity of ridiculing her relations was bad enough; and she could not determine whether the silent contempt of the gentleman, or the insolent smiles of the ladies, were more intolerable.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "Eventually, Mrs. Bennet finished speaking. Lady Lucas, having been yawning for a while at the endless talk of pleasures she wasn't going to experience, was left to enjoy the supper of cold ham and chicken. Elizabeth started to feel better. This calm period didn't last long. After supper, singing was brought up, and Elizabeth was dismayed to see Mary, after only slight encouragement, prepare to sing for everyone. Despite her best efforts, using many meaningful glances and silent requests, Elizabeth tried to prevent this display of eager willingness, but it was useless; Mary deliberately overlooked them. She found the chance to show off delightful and began her song. Elizabeth watched her with intense discomfort and distress. She followed Mary's performance through each verse, growing increasingly impatient, but her frustration was compounded when, after being thanked and hinted at singing again, Mary immediately launched into a second song after a brief delay. Mary's abilities were not suitable for such a public performance; her voice was weak, and her mannerisms were artificial. Elizabeth was extremely distressed. She glanced at Jane to see how she was coping, but Jane was calmly chatting with Bingley. She observed his two sisters making mocking gestures to each other and towards Darcy, who remained unyieldingly serious. She looked at her father, silently pleading for him to intervene and stop Mary from potentially singing all night. He took the hint, and once Mary had finished her second song, he announced, \"That will do very well, my child. You've entertained us for quite long enough. It's time for the other young ladies to have their turn.\" Mary, while pretending she hadn't heard, was visibly flustered, and Elizabeth, feeling pity for her and regret for her father's blunt comment, feared her earlier anxiety had achieved nothing positive. The company then turned to asking others to sing. \"If I were fortunate enough to possess the ability to sing,\" Mr. Collins stated, \"I would be very happy to oblige the company with a tune, as I consider music a harmless pastime perfectly compatible with the role of a clergyman. However, I don't mean to suggest one should devote excessive time to music, for there are certainly other responsibilities. A parish rector has many duties. Firstly, he must arrange tithes in a way that benefits himself and does not offend his patron. He must compose his own sermons, and the remaining time will be fully occupied by his parish obligations and the upkeep and improvement of his home, which he is expected to make as comfortable as possible. And I believe it is quite important that he maintain polite and agreeable behaviour towards everyone, particularly those to whom he owes his position. I could not forgive him for neglecting this duty, nor could I think highly of a man who missed an opportunity to express his respect to anyone associated with the family.\" He concluded his address, which had been delivered loudly enough for half the room to hear, with a bow to Mr. Darcy. Many people stared, and many smiled, but no one seemed more entertained than Mr. Bennet himself, while his wife seriously praised Mr. Collins for speaking so wisely and remarked quietly to Lady Lucas that he was an unusually intelligent and kind young man. To Elizabeth, it seemed as though her family had deliberately agreed to make themselves look as foolish as possible throughout the evening; it would have been impossible for them to perform their roles with more enthusiasm or greater success. She was grateful for Bingley and her sister's sake that some of the embarrassing display had escaped his attention and that his temperament was not easily bothered by the foolishness he must have witnessed. However, it was quite distressing that his two sisters and Mr. Darcy had been given such a perfect opportunity to mock her family members, and she couldn't decide whether the gentleman's silent disdain or the ladies' insolent smirks were harder to bear.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "Eventually, Mrs. Bennet ran out of things to say, and Lady Lucas, bored by talk of joys she wouldn't get to experience, found solace in her plate of cold ham and chicken. Elizabeth began to feel better, but her peace didn't last. After supper, the idea of singing arose, and to Elizabeth's embarrassment, Mary eagerly prepared to sing with little encouragement. Despite Elizabeth's pleading looks, Mary didn't take the hint and seized the chance to perform. With discomfort, Elizabeth watched Mary's performance, feeling increasingly impatient, especially when Mary's lackluster singing was met with encouragement for more. Accepting the request, Mary started another song, though her singing was weak and her manner overly theatrical. Elizabeth suffered through it, glancing at Jane, who was unconcernedly chatting with Bingley, and at Bingley's sisters, who exchanged mocking glances, and at Mr. Darcy, who remained stern. Looking to her father for rescue, she was relieved when, after Mary's second song, he diplomatically ended the ordeal, saying she'd delighted everyone long enough and it was time for others to take a turn. Mary, feigning not to hear but clearly rattled, stopped, and Elizabeth regretted the awkwardness the intervention caused. Mr. Collins then pontificated about the value of music for a clergyman, while insisting other duties took precedence, and used the moment to flatter Mr. Darcy. His pompous speech amused some and was met by praise from Mrs. Bennet, who whispered to Lady Lucas how clever she found him. Elizabeth felt as if her family were trying especially hard to embarrass themselves, and wondered how much of it Bingley had witnessed. She was grateful Bingley and Jane seemed not to care, but resented that Mr. Darcy and his sisters had such a chance to mock her relatives. She was unsure if Darcy's silent disapproval or his sisters' smirks were harder to tolerate."

She was teased by Mr. Collins, who continued most perseveringly by her side; and though he could not prevail with her to dance with him again, put it out of her power to dance with others. In vain did she entreat him to stand up with somebody else, and offered to introduce him to any young lady in the room. He assured her that, as to dancing, he was perfectly indifferent to it; that his chief object was, by delicate attentions, to recommend himself to her; and that he should therefore make a point of remaining close to her the whole evening. There was no arguing upon such a project. She owed her greatest relief to her friend Miss Lucas, who often joined them, and good-naturedly engaged Mr. Collins’s conversation to herself.\nShe was at least free from the offence of Mr. Darcy’s further notice: though often standing within a very short distance of her, quite disengaged, he never came near enough to speak. She felt it to be the probable consequence of her allusions to Mr. Wickham, and rejoiced in it.\nThe Longbourn party were the last of all the company to depart; and by a manœuvre of Mrs. Bennet had to wait for their carriage a quarter of an hour after everybody else was gone, which gave them time to see how heartily they were wished away by some of the family. Mrs. Hurst and her sister scarcely opened their mouths except to complain of fatigue, and were evidently impatient to have the house to themselves. They repulsed every attempt of Mrs. Bennet at conversation, and, by so doing, threw a languor over the whole party, which was very little relieved by the long speeches of Mr. Collins, who was complimenting Mr. Bingley and his sisters on the elegance of their entertainment, and the hospitality and politeness which had marked their behaviour to their guests. Darcy said nothing at all. Mr. Bennet, in equal silence, was enjoying the scene. Mr. Bingley and Jane were standing together a little detached from the rest, and talked only to each other. Elizabeth preserved as steady a silence as either Mrs. Hurst or Miss Bingley; and even Lydia was too much fatigued to utter more than the occasional exclamation of “Lord, how tired I am!” accompanied by a violent yawn.\nWhen at length they arose to take leave, Mrs. Bennet was most pressingly civil in her hope of seeing the whole family soon at Longbourn; and addressed herself particularly to Mr. Bingley, to assure him how happy he would make them, by eating a family dinner with them at any time, without the ceremony of a formal invitation. Bingley was all grateful pleasure; and he readily engaged for taking the earliest opportunity of waiting on her after his return from London, whither he was obliged to go the next day for a short time.\nMrs. Bennet was perfectly satisfied; and quitted the house under the delightful persuasion that, allowing for the necessary preparations of settlements, new carriages, and wedding clothes, she should undoubtedly see her daughter settled at Netherfield in the course of three or four months. Of having another daughter married to Mr. Collins she thought with equal certainty, and with considerable, though not equal, pleasure. Elizabeth was the least dear to her of all her children; and though the man and the match were quite good enough for her, the worth of each was eclipsed by Mr. Bingley and Netherfield.",

He stated that his primary goal was to gain her favour through careful attention and that he therefore intended to remain close to her throughout the evening. There was no effective argument against such a declared purpose. Her greatest relief came from her friend Miss Lucas, who frequently joined them and kindly occupied Mr. Collins's conversation.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "Elizabeth found little pleasure in the rest of the evening, as Mr. Collins persisted in staying by her side and, while she refused to dance with him again, his presence kept her from dancing with others. She tried in vain to persuade him to dance with someone else and even offered to introduce him to other ladies, but he insisted he had no real interest in dancing and merely wanted to show her special attention by remaining with her throughout the night. She found no way to argue him out of this plan. Luckily, her friend Miss Lucas frequently joined them and kindly drew Mr. Collins into conversation with her, providing Elizabeth with some relief. \n\nAt least Elizabeth avoided further attention from Mr. Darcy; although he often stood nearby without company, he never approached her, which she supposed was the result of her earlier remarks about Mr. Wickham—a situation that pleased her. The Longbourn group were the last to leave the gathering, having to wait for their carriage due to Mrs. Bennet's arrangements. This delay allowed them to notice how much certain members of the Bingley household wanted their visit to end. Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley barely spoke, except to complain of tiredness, and were plainly eager to be left alone. They rebuffed Mrs. Bennet’s attempts at friendly conversation, creating an awkward atmosphere, only somewhat alleviated by Mr. Collins’s lengthy compliments to Mr. Bingley and his sisters about the excellence of their event and their hospitality. Darcy said nothing, and Mr. Bennet, also silent, seemed to enjoy observing the situation. Mr. Bingley and Jane stood apart, conversing quietly with each other. Elizabeth kept as silent as Mrs. Hurst or Miss Bingley, and even Lydia was too tired to say more than the occasional complaint accompanied by a yawn.\n\nWhen it was finally time to go, Mrs. Bennet very cordially invited the Bingleys to visit Longbourn and especially urged Mr. Bingley to dine with them informally whenever he pleased. Bingley was delighted and promised to visit at the first opportunity after he returned from a short trip to London. Mrs. Bennet left perfectly content, already imagining her daughter Jane would soon be settled at Netherfield after a few months, and also feeling confident, though less pleased, about Elizabeth marrying Mr. Collins. Jane’s marriage prospects pleased her most, as she considered both Mr. Bingley and Netherfield superior to Mr. Collins and what he could offer Elizabeth."

Having decided not to delay, given that his visit was only until the next Saturday, and feeling no shyness or discomfort about the task, he proceeded in an organized and ceremonious way, following what he believed to be proper etiquette. Shortly after breakfast, he found Mrs. Bennet, Elizabeth, and one of the younger sisters together. He turned to Mrs. Bennet and said, “Madam, might I hope for your support with your lovely daughter Elizabeth, as I wish to request a private conversation with her this morning?” Before Elizabeth could do more than blush in surprise, Mrs. Bennet quickly responded, “Oh, absolutely! I’m sure Lizzy will be delighted—she certainly won’t object. Come along, Kitty, I want you upstairs.” As she gathered her things to leave, Elizabeth called out, “Please, ma’am, don’t go. I really do not wish you to leave. Mr. Collins must excuse me; there is nothing he needs to say to me that can’t be heard by others. In fact, I am going to leave myself.” “Nonsense, Lizzy,” Mrs. Bennet insisted. “I want you to stay right where you are.” When Elizabeth appeared intent on leaving, clearly flustered and upset, Mrs. Bennet continued, “Lizzy, I insist that you stay and listen to Mr. Collins.” Elizabeth did not resist this command. On brief reflection, she realized it was best to get the ordeal over with quickly and quietly. She sat back down and tried to hide her mixed feelings of embarrassment and amusement by keeping her hands busy. Once Mrs. Bennet and Kitty had left, Mr. Collins began his address."

You would have been less amiable in my eyes had there not been this little unwillingness; but allow me to assure you that I have your respected mother’s permission for this address. You can hardly doubt the purport of my discourse, however your natural delicacy may lead you to dissemble; my attentions have been too marked to be mistaken. Almost as soon as I entered the house I singled you out as the companion of my future life. But before I am run away with by my feelings on this subject, perhaps it will be advisable for me to state my reasons for marrying—and, moreover, for coming into Hertfordshire with the design of selecting a wife, as I certainly did.”\nThe idea of Mr. Collins, with all his solemn composure, being run away with by his feelings, made Elizabeth so near laughing that she could not use the short pause he allowed in any attempt to stop him farther, and he continued,—\n“My reasons for marrying are, first, that I think it a right thing for every clergyman in easy circumstances (like myself) to set the example of matrimony in his parish; secondly, that I am convinced it will add very greatly to my happiness; and, thirdly, which perhaps I ought to have mentioned earlier, that it is the particular advice and recommendation of the very noble lady whom I have the honour of calling patroness. Twice has she condescended to give me her opinion (unasked too!) on this subject; and it was but the very Saturday night before I left Hunsford,—between our pools at quadrille, while Mrs. Jenkinson was arranging Miss De Bourgh’s footstool,—that she said, ‘Mr. Collins, you must marry. A clergyman like you must marry. Choose properly, choose a gentlewoman for my sake, and for your own; let her be an active, useful sort of person, not brought up high, but able to make a small income go a good way. This is my advice. Find such a woman as soon as you can, bring her to Hunsford, and I will visit her.’ Allow me, by the way, to observe, my fair cousin, that I do not reckon the notice and kindness of Lady Catherine de Bourgh as among the least of the advantages in my power to offer. You will find her manners beyond anything I can describe; and your wit and vivacity, I think, must be acceptable to her, especially when tempered with the silence and respect which her rank will inevitably excite. Thus much for my general intention in favour of matrimony; it remains to be told why my views were directed to Longbourn instead of my own neighbourhood, where I assure you there are many amiable young women. But the fact is, that being, as I am, to inherit this estate after the death of your honoured father (who, however, may live many years longer), I could not satisfy myself without resolving to choose a wife from among his daughters, that the loss to them might be as little as possible when the melancholy event takes place—which, however, as I have already said, may not be for several years. This has been my motive, my fair cousin, and I flatter myself it will not sink me in your esteem. And now nothing remains for me but to assure you in the most animated language of the violence of my affection. To fortune I am perfectly indifferent, and shall make no demand of that nature on your father, since I am well aware that it could not be complied with; and that one thousand pounds in the 4 per cents., which will not be yours till after your mother’s decease, is all that you may ever be entitled to. On that head, therefore, I shall be uniformly silent: and you may assure yourself that no ungenerous reproach shall ever pass my lips when we are married.”",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "Believe me, my dear Miss Elizabeth, your modesty, far from being a disadvantage, actually enhances your many admirable qualities. You would have been less appealing to me if you hadn't shown this slight hesitation; but let me assure you that I have received permission from your esteemed mother for this proposal. You can scarcely be uncertain about the purpose of my speech, no matter how much your natural reserve might lead you to pretend ignorance; my intentions have been too clearly displayed to be misunderstood. Very shortly after arriving in this house, I selected you as the partner for my future existence. However, before I become too carried away by my emotions on this matter, perhaps it would be wise for me to explain my reasons for entering into matrimony—and furthermore, for coming specifically to Hertfordshire with the deliberate plan of finding a wife, which was certainly my intention.” The thought of Mr. Collins, with his usual solemn dignity, being 'carried away by his feelings' struck Elizabeth as so comical that she was on the verge of laughter and couldn't use the brief pause he allowed to try and prevent him from continuing. He went on, “My reasons for marrying are, firstly, my belief that it is correct and proper for any clergyman in comfortable circumstances (such as myself) to provide an example of married life within his parish; secondly, my absolute certainty that it will significantly increase my personal happiness; and thirdly, and perhaps this should have been mentioned earlier, it is the specific suggestion and endorsement of the truly noble lady whom I have the honor of considering my patroness. On two occasions, she has graciously offered me her perspective (even though I did not ask!) on this matter; and it was only last Saturday evening before I departed Hunsford,—in the interval between our rounds of quadrille, while Mrs. Jenkinson was positioning Miss De Bourgh’s footstool,—that she remarked, ‘Mr. Collins, you must marry. A clergyman of your standing must marry. Make a suitable choice, select a gentlewoman for my benefit, and for your own; let her be practical and useful, not from the highest social circle, but capable of managing a modest income effectively. This is my recommendation. Find such a woman as soon as possible, bring her back to Hunsford, and I shall visit her.’ Allow me to mention, by the way, my dear cousin, that I do not consider the attention and kindness of Lady Catherine de Bourgh among the least of the benefits I can offer. You will find her manners are quite extraordinary; and your intelligence and lively spirit, I believe, must be pleasing to her, especially when balanced by the quiet deference and respect that her position will naturally command. So much for my general intention regarding marriage; it remains for me to explain why I decided to look for a wife at Longbourn rather than in my own locality, where I assure you there are many agreeable young women. But the reality is, that since I am destined to inherit this property after the passing of your esteemed father (who, however, may live for many more years), I felt compelled to choose a wife from among his daughters, so that the impact upon them would be as minimal as possible when that unfortunate event occurs—which, as I have previously stated, might not happen for several years. This, my dear cousin, has been my motivation, and I sincerely hope it will not diminish me in your estimation. And now, nothing remains but for me to express the intensity of my affection for you in the most passionate terms. I am entirely unconcerned with financial matters, and I will make no demands of that kind upon your father, as I am fully aware that it would not be feasible; and that the sum of one thousand pounds in the 4 per cents, which will only become yours after your mother’s death, is the entirety of what you may ever be entitled to. On that subject, therefore, I shall maintain complete silence: and you can be certain that no unkind remark shall ever pass my lips once we are married.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "\"Believe me, Miss Elizabeth, your modesty doesn't harm you—in fact, it only adds to your other virtues. Without a little hesitation on your part, I would find you less agreeable, but please know that I have your esteemed mother’s permission to speak to you in this way. Surely, you must know my purpose in saying all this, even if your natural shyness leads you to hide it—my attentions to you have been obvious. Almost as soon as I arrived, I singled you out as the one I hoped would be my companion for life. Before I let my emotions run away with me, though, allow me to explain why I wish to marry, and why I came to Hertfordshire specifically to find a wife.\" \n\nThe idea of the usually solemn Mr. Collins being overwhelmed by his emotions almost made Elizabeth laugh, so she couldn’t use the pause he gave to interrupt, and so he carried on: \n\n\"My reasons for marrying are: firstly, I believe every clergyman with a comfortable living, like myself, should set an example and marry; secondly, I am certain it will greatly improve my own happiness; and thirdly, and I perhaps should have mentioned this sooner, it is the advice of my esteemed patroness, Lady Catherine de Bourgh. She has condescended to give me her opinion on the subject more than once; in fact, just last Saturday night before I left Hunsford, between rounds of cards, she told me, 'Mr. Collins, you must marry. A clergyman in your position must marry. Choose wisely—for my sake and your own. Find an active, capable woman, not raised too high, who can manage a modest income well. Do so soon, bring her to Hunsford, and I will visit.' May I add, my dear cousin, that having Lady Catherine’s attention is one of the advantages I offer. Her demeanor is beyond description, and I am sure your intelligence and liveliness will appeal to her—especially if combined with the respect her rank deserves. Those are my general reasons for marriage; as for why I chose Longbourn over my own neighborhood, where there are many suitable young women: since I am to inherit this estate after your honored father passes away (which, I hope, won’t be for many years), I felt it only fair to select a wife from among his daughters, so that the loss might be less painful when that sad time comes—though, as I said, not for many years. This is my main reason, cousin, and I hope it does not lessen your opinion of me. Now, let me assure you of the depth of my affection. I care nothing for fortune and will not ask your father for any, as I know it cannot be provided; and the thousand pounds you will inherit after your mother’s death is all you will have. On that subject I will always remain silent, and you can be certain I will never utter a reproach when we are married.\""

My reasons for believing it are briefly these:—It does not appear to me that my hand is unworthy your acceptance, or that the establishment I can offer would be any other than highly desirable. My situation in life, my connections with the family of De Bourgh, and my relationship to your own, are circumstances highly in my favour; and you should take it into further consideration that, in spite of your manifold attractions, it is by no means certain that another offer of marriage may ever be made you. Your portion is unhappily so small, that it will in all likelihood undo the effects of your loveliness and amiable qualifications.

I would rather be paid the compliment of being believed sincere. I thank you again and again for the honour you have done me in your proposals, but to accept them is absolutely impossible.

Please allow me to make my own judgment and do me the favour of trusting what I tell you. I sincerely wish you much happiness and wealth, and by turning down your marriage proposal, I’m doing everything I can to prevent you from being unhappy or poor. By proposing to me, you’ve fulfilled your sense of duty towards my family, and you can take possession of the Longbourn estate when it becomes available without feeling guilty about it. Therefore, let's consider this matter completely settled.” She started to get up to leave after saying this, but Mr. Collins stopped her by saying, “When I have the honour of discussing this subject with you again, I expect to receive a more favourable answer than the one you’ve just given me. Although I'm not accusing you of being cruel right now, because I know it's the standard practice for women to refuse a man the first time he proposes, and perhaps what you’ve said today is actually as encouraging to my suit as is appropriate for a truly refined female character.” Elizabeth exclaimed with some irritation, “Honestly, Mr. Collins, you utterly baffle me. If anything I’ve said so far can possibly be interpreted as encouragement, I have no idea how I could possibly refuse you in a way that would convince you that it’s a genuine refusal.” Mr. Collins replied, “You must permit me, my dear cousin, to assume that your refusal of my proposal is simply a formality. My reasons for believing this are straightforward: it doesn’t seem to me that my offer of marriage is unworthy of you, or that the position and home I can provide would be anything less than highly desirable. My standing in society, my connections to the De Bourgh family, and my relation to your own family are all strongly in my favour. Furthermore, you should consider that despite your many charms, it’s by no means guaranteed that you’ll ever receive another proposal of marriage. Sadly, your inheritance is so small that it will likely cancel out the positive effect of your beauty and pleasant qualities. Since I must therefore conclude that you are not serious in rejecting me, I shall choose to believe it is because you wish to heighten my affection by keeping me in suspense, which is the usual behaviour of sophisticated ladies.” Elizabeth retorted, “I assure you, sir, I have absolutely no desire for that kind of sophistication that involves tormenting a respectable man. I would prefer that you believe me to be sincere. I thank you again and again for the honour of your proposals, but accepting them is absolutely impossible. My feelings in every way prevent it. Can I possibly speak more clearly? Please do not see me as a sophisticated lady trying to tease you, but as a sensible person speaking the truth from her heart.” He cried, with an awkward attempt at gallantry, “You are consistently charming! And I am convinced that once my proposals are approved by both of your excellent parents, they will definitely be acceptable.” Elizabeth decided not to respond to such stubborn self-deception. She left the room immediately and silently, determined that if he continued to interpret her repeated refusals as flattering encouragement, she would ask her father for help. Her father’s definite refusal would be expressed in a way that left no room for doubt, and his behaviour could certainly not be mistaken for the affected or flirtatious conduct of a refined lady.",

She sincerely wishes him happiness and prosperity, and by refusing his proposal, she’s trying to prevent the opposite. She explains that, by offering to marry her, Mr. Collins has done his duty towards her family, and he can inherit Longbourn guilt-free. She considers the matter settled and tries to leave, but Mr. Collins interrupts, believing she is only refusing him as is customary for women and is actually encouraging him. Elizabeth, frustrated, insists she has given him no encouragement and if he thinks she has, she doesn’t know how else to make her refusal clear. Mr. Collins persists, convinced her refusal is not genuine, claiming that he is a desirable match because of his connections and her lack of fortune, and suggesting that she is only trying to keep him in suspense like many refined women do. Elizabeth assures him she is sincere and not playing games, that it is impossible for her to accept him, and that her feelings make it out of the question. Mr. Collins, undeterred, says he is sure her parents will persuade her to accept him. Seeing that he will not listen, Elizabeth leaves, deciding that if he continues, she will ask her father to intervene and refuse on her behalf, since that would be clear and unmistakable."

Mr. Collins received and returned these felicitations with equal pleasure, and then proceeded to relate the particulars of their interview, with the result of which he trusted he had every reason to be satisfied, since the refusal which his cousin had steadfastly given him would naturally flow from her bashful modesty and the genuine delicacy of her character.\nThis information, however, startled Mrs. Bennet: she would have been glad to be equally satisfied that her daughter had meant to encourage him by protesting against his proposals, but she dared not believe it, and could not help saying so.\n“But depend upon it, Mr. Collins,” she added, “that Lizzy shall be brought to reason. I will speak to her about it myself directly. She is a very headstrong, foolish girl, and does not know her own interest; but I will make her know it.”\n“Pardon me for interrupting you, madam,” cried Mr. Collins; “but if she is really headstrong and foolish, I know not whether she would altogether be a very desirable wife to a man in my situation, who naturally looks for happiness in the marriage state. If, therefore, she actually persists in rejecting my suit, perhaps it were better not to force her into accepting me, because, if liable to such defects of temper, she could not contribute much to my felicity.”\n“Sir, you quite misunderstand me,” said Mrs. Bennet, alarmed. “Lizzy is only headstrong in such matters as these.

Mrs. Bennet had been waiting in the hall, keeping watch for the end of the private discussion. As soon as she saw Elizabeth open the door and quickly walk past her towards the stairs, she entered the breakfast room. There, she warmly congratulated both him and herself on the promising possibility of them becoming closely related. Mr. Collins was equally pleased to receive and give these congratulations. He then went on to describe the details of their interview, stating that he believed he had every reason to be content with the result, as his cousin's firm refusal was clearly just a natural expression of her modest shyness and delicate character. However, this news surprised Mrs. Bennet. She would have been happy to believe, as he did, that her daughter was only protesting out of shyness, but she couldn't bring herself to believe it and had to admit her doubt. \"But you can count on it, Mr. Collins,\" she added, \"Lizzy will be persuaded. I will speak to her about it myself immediately. She is a very stubborn, silly girl who doesn't know what's good for her, but I will make sure she finds out.\" \"Excuse me for interrupting you, madam,\" Mr. Collins quickly said, \"but if she is genuinely stubborn and silly, I'm not certain she would be an altogether suitable wife for someone like me, who naturally seeks happiness in marriage. So, if she truly insists on rejecting my proposal, perhaps it would be better not to compel her to accept me, because if she is prone to such defects of character, she couldn't significantly contribute to my well-being.\" \"Sir, you completely misunderstand me,\" said Mrs. Bennet, looking worried. \"Lizzy is only headstrong in matters like these. In every other way, she is as kind-hearted a girl as has ever lived. I will go straight to Mr. Bennet, and we will settle this with her very soon, I am sure.\"",

Mr. Collins gratefully accepted her congratulations and then proceeded to describe the details of his proposal to Elizabeth, feeling confident that her firm refusal only demonstrated her modesty and refined character. This explanation surprised Mrs. Bennet; she would have liked to believe that Elizabeth actually meant to encourage him with her protests, but she couldn’t bring herself to accept it, and said as much. “But rest assured, Mr. Collins,” she added, “Lizzy will come around. I’ll speak to her about it myself immediately. She’s a very stubborn, foolish girl, and does not know what’s good for her; but I will make her understand.”\n\n“Excuse my interruption, madam,” exclaimed Mr. Collins, “but if she truly is so stubborn and foolish, then perhaps she would not be a suitable wife for someone like myself, who naturally seeks happiness in marriage. If she is determined to refuse me, it may not be wise to force her to accept, because with such flaws in temperament, she would not add much to my happiness.”\n\n“Sir, you are quite mistaken,” replied Mrs. Bennet, now anxious. “Lizzy is only stubborn in matters like this. In every other way, she is as kind-hearted a girl as you could hope to meet. I will go straight to Mr. Bennet, and we’ll soon settle things with her, I’m sure.”"

Perhaps not the less so from feeling a doubt of my positive happiness had my fair cousin honoured me with her hand; for I have often observed, that resignation is never so perfect as when the blessing denied begins to lose somewhat of its value in our estimation. You will not, I hope, consider me as showing any disrespect to your family, my dear madam, by thus withdrawing my pretensions to your daughter’s favour, without having paid yourself and Mr. Bennet the compliment of requesting you to interpose your authority in my behalf. My conduct may, I fear, be objectionable in having accepted my dismission from your daughter’s lips instead of your own; but we are all liable to error. I have certainly meant well through the whole affair.

Accepting unavoidable misfortune is everyone's duty; it is particularly the duty of a young man who has been as fortunate as I have been in my early advancement; and I believe I have accepted it. Perhaps my acceptance is easier because I doubt if I would have been truly happy had my lovely cousin agreed to marry me; for I have often noticed that acceptance is most complete when the blessing that was denied starts to seem less valuable in our eyes. I hope, my dear madam, you will not consider it disrespectful to your family that I am withdrawing my suit for your daughter's favor in this way, without first asking you and Mr. Bennet to intervene on my behalf. My conduct might, I worry, be considered improper because I accepted her rejection directly instead of from you; but we are all capable of making mistakes.

It was improbable that their absence from Netherfield would prevent Mr. Bingley from being there; and as for the loss of the sisters' society, she was confident that Jane would quickly forget it once she was enjoying her happiness with him.\nAfter a brief pause, Elizabeth said, 'It is unfortunate that you won't be able to see your friends before they leave the county. But couldn't we hope that the time of future happiness Miss Bingley is looking forward to might arrive sooner than she anticipates, and that the pleasant interaction you've shared as friends will be resumed with even more satisfaction as sisters? Mr. Bingley will not be held up in London because of them.'",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "She then read aloud the first sentence, which said that they had just decided to follow their brother to London immediately, planning to dine that day at Mr. Hurst's house on Grosvenor Street. The next sentence read: \"I do not claim to regret leaving anything in Hertfordshire except your company, my dearest friend; but let us hope that, in the future, we will have many more chances to enjoy the pleasant companionship we've shared, and in the meantime, we can ease the pain of parting by writing to each other often and openly. I am counting on you for this.\" Elizabeth listened to these overly sentimental words with a skeptical and detached attitude; and though their sudden departure surprised her, she found nothing to truly be upset about: it was unlikely that Mr. Bingley wouldn't still spend time at Netherfield just because his sisters were leaving, and she was confident that Jane would soon forget the loss of their company while happy with him. After a brief pause, Elizabeth said, \"It's unfortunate that you can't see your friends before they leave the area. But perhaps the happy future Miss Bingley hopes for will come sooner than expected, and the friendship you have now will become even more satisfying once you are sisters. Mr. Bingley won't stay in London because of them.\""

Many of my acquaintance are already there for the winter: I wish I could hear that you, my dearest friend, had any intention of making one in the crowd, but of that I despair. I sincerely hope your Christmas in Hertfordshire may abound in the gaieties which that season generally brings, and that your beaux will be so numerous as to prevent your feeling the loss of the three of whom we shall deprive you.’\n“It is evident by this,” added Jane, “that he comes back no more this winter.”\n“It is only evident that Miss Bingley does not mean he should.”\n“Why will you think so? It must be his own doing; he is his own master. But you do not know all. I will read you the passage which particularly hurts me. I will have no reserves from you. ‘Mr. Darcy is impatient to see his sister; and to confess the truth, we are scarcely less eager to meet her again. I really do not think Georgiana Darcy has her equal for beauty, elegance, and accomplishments; and the affection she inspires in Louisa and myself is heightened into something still more interesting from the hope we dare to entertain of her being hereafter our sister. I do not know whether I ever before mentioned to you my feelings on this subject, but I will not leave the country without confiding them, and I trust you will not esteem them unreasonable. My brother admires her greatly already; he will have frequent opportunity now of seeing her on the most intimate footing; her relations all wish the connection as much as his own; and a sister’s partiality is not misleading me, I think, when I call Charles most capable of engaging any woman’s heart. With all these circumstances to favour an attachment, and nothing to prevent it, am I wrong, my dearest Jane, in indulging the hope of an event which will secure the happiness of so many?’ What think you of this sentence, my dear Lizzy?” said Jane, as she finished it. “Is it not clear enough?

Furthermore, we are convinced that once Charles is in town, he won't be quick to leave again. Consequently, we've decided to join him there so he doesn't have to spend his free time alone in an uncomfortable hotel. Many of my acquaintances are already spending the winter there. My dearest friend, I truly wish you had any intention of joining the crowd, but I despair of that happening. I sincerely hope your Christmas in Hertfordshire is full of the usual seasonal festivities and that you have so many admirers that you won't miss the three of us who will be absent.' Jane then added, 'Based on this, it's clear he won't be coming back this winter.' Elizabeth countered, 'It's only clear that Miss Bingley doesn't want him to.' 'Why would you think that?' Jane asked.

Caroline wrote: \"Mr. Darcy is eager to see his sister, and truthfully, Louisa and I are almost as impatient to see her again. I honestly believe Georgiana Darcy is unparalleled in beauty, grace, and accomplishments. The affection she inspires in Louisa and myself is intensified by the hope we cautiously hold that she will eventually become our sister. I'm not sure if I've mentioned my feelings on this matter before, but I cannot leave the area without sharing them, and I trust you won't find them unreasonable. My brother already admires her greatly; he will now have frequent opportunities to see her in a very close setting. Her family is as keen on this connection as his own. And I don't think a sister's partiality is misleading me when I say Charles is very capable of winning any woman's heart. With all these circumstances favoring a connection, and nothing preventing it, am I wrong, my dearest Jane, to indulge in the hope of an event that will ensure the happiness of so many?\"' Finishing the quote, Jane turned to Elizabeth. 'What do you think of this sentence, my dear Lizzy?' she asked. 'Isn't it perfectly obvious? Doesn't it explicitly state that Caroline neither expects nor desires me to be her sister-in-law; that she is completely sure her brother feels no interest in me; and that if she suspects the nature of my feelings for him, she intends (most kindly!) to caution me?

Jane then reads Caroline’s letter aloud, which describes how when Charles (Mr. Bingley) went to London, he thought his business there would only take a few days, but now it’s clear that it’ll be longer. Caroline writes that once Charles is in London, he won’t be in any rush to leave, so she and Louisa have decided to join him so that he doesn’t have to be alone and bored at a hotel. She mentions that many of her acquaintances are already in London for the winter, and she wishes Jane could join them, though she knows that Jane isn’t planning to be there. Caroline hopes Jane will have an enjoyable Christmas in Hertfordshire, with plenty of parties and potential suitors to distract her from missing the three people (herself, Louisa, and Charles) who are leaving. Jane then comments that this letter makes it clear Charles will not return that winter. Elizabeth disagrees, suggesting it only shows Caroline doesn’t want him to. Jane insists there’s more evidence and reads a letter passage where Caroline says Darcy is anxious to see his sister, and both she and Louisa are just as eager. Caroline gushes about Georgiana Darcy’s beauty, talents, and the affection she inspires in them, even hinting they hope Georgiana will become part of their family. Caroline admits she’s hopeful Charles and Georgiana will be frequently together, that their families approve, and that Charles could easily win any woman’s heart. She asks Jane if she’s wrong to hope for the happiness that would come from such a connection. Jane then asks Elizabeth if this wording is not clear proof that Caroline neither expects nor wants Jane to be her sister-in-law, and that Caroline is certain of Charles’ lack of interest in Jane—perhaps even warning her not to hope for his affections. Jane questions if there’s any other possible interpretation."

If Mr. Darcy had shown her half that much affection, she would have already ordered her wedding gown. But here is the real situation: we aren't wealthy or important enough for them.

Anyone who has seen you two together couldn't doubt his feelings for you; and I'm sure Miss Bingley knows it—she isn't naive.

But the truth is, we're not wealthy or important enough for them, and she's especially eager for her brother to marry Miss Darcy.

Elizabeth took an opportunity of thanking her. “It keeps him in good humour,” said she, “and I am more obliged to you than I can express.”\nCharlotte assured her friend of her satisfaction in being useful, and that it amply repaid her for the little sacrifice of her time. This was very amiable; but Charlotte’s kindness extended farther than Elizabeth had any conception of:—its object was nothing less than to secure her from any return of Mr. Collins’s addresses, by engaging them towards herself. Such was Miss Lucas’s scheme; and appearances were so favourable, that when they parted at night, she would have felt almost sure of success if he had not been to leave Hertfordshire so very soon. But here she did injustice to the fire and independence of his character; for it led him to escape out of Longbourn House the next morning with admirable slyness, and hasten to Lucas Lodge to throw himself at her feet. He was anxious to avoid the notice of his cousins, from a conviction that, if they saw him depart, they could not fail to conjecture his design, and he was not willing to have the attempt known till its success could be known likewise; for, though feeling almost secure, and with reason, for Charlotte had been tolerably encouraging, he was comparatively diffident since the adventure of Wednesday. His reception, however, was of the most flattering kind. Miss Lucas perceived him from an upper window as he walked towards the house, and instantly set out to meet him accidentally in the lane. But little had she dared to hope that so much love and eloquence awaited her there.",

Elizabeth seized an opportunity to express her thanks. She remarked that it kept him in good spirits and that she was more indebted than she could say. Charlotte responded by assuring her friend that she was pleased to be of assistance and that it more than made up for the small amount of time it cost her. This seemed like a simple act of kindness, but Charlotte's helpfulness was motivated by a deeper intention that Elizabeth had no inkling of: her aim was to deter Mr. Collins from pursuing Elizabeth further by drawing his attention to herself. This was Miss Lucas's plan, and circumstances appeared so favorable that when they parted that evening, she would have felt almost certain of achieving her goal, if he hadn't been scheduled to leave Hertfordshire so very shortly. However, in this she misjudged the spirited and independent streak in his character. This characteristic prompted him to slip away from Longbourn House the next morning with impressive discretion and hurry to Lucas Lodge to offer his hand in marriage. He wished to avoid being noticed by his cousins, convinced that if they saw him depart, they would inevitably deduce his intention, and he didn't want his attempt to be known until its success was assured. Although feeling quite confident, and with good reason given Charlotte's considerable encouragement, he was comparatively more cautious since his unsuccessful proposal earlier that week. Nevertheless, his reception was extremely welcoming. Miss Lucas spotted him approaching from an upper window and promptly went out to meet him in the lane, pretending it was a chance encounter. Yet, she had scarcely allowed herself to hope that such passionate declarations and eloquent words awaited her there.",

Elizabeth found a moment to thank her, saying that Charlotte kept Mr. Collins in good spirits and that she was more grateful than she could say. Charlotte assured Elizabeth that she was happy to help, and that it was a small price to pay. Although this seemed very kind, Charlotte had more in mind than Elizabeth realized: her intention was not simply to assist her friend, but to attract Mr. Collins’s attentions to herself and spare Elizabeth from further proposals. Such was Charlotte’s plan; and things seemed to be going well enough that, when they parted that night, she would have been confident of success if it were not for Mr. Collins’s imminent departure from Hertfordshire. However, Charlotte underestimated Mr. Collins’s decisiveness, as he secretly left Longbourn House early the next morning and quickly made his way to Lucas Lodge to propose. He wanted to be discreet and avoid being seen by his cousins, knowing they would guess his intentions, and preferred that no one know about his suit until it succeeded. Although he felt almost sure Charlotte would accept, especially since she had encouraged him, he still felt somewhat uncertain after his previous failed proposal. Fortunately for him, Charlotte welcomed him warmly. She saw him approaching from an upstairs window and hurried out to 'accidentally' meet him in the lane, though she had not hoped for such affection and passionate words from him."

The younger girls formed hopes of coming out a year or two sooner than they might otherwise have done; and the boys were relieved from their apprehension of Charlotte’s dying an old maid. Charlotte herself was tolerably composed. She had gained her point, and had time to consider of it. Her reflections were in general satisfactory. Mr. Collins, to be sure, was neither sensible nor agreeable: his society was irksome, and his attachment to her must be imaginary. But still he would be her husband. Without thinking highly either of men or of matrimony, marriage had always been her object: it was the only honourable provision for well-educated young women of small fortune, and, however uncertain of giving happiness, must be their pleasantest preservative from want. This preservative she had now obtained; and at the age of twenty-seven, without having ever been handsome, she felt all the good luck of it. The least agreeable circumstance in the business was the surprise it must occasion to Elizabeth Bennet, whose friendship she valued beyond that of any other person. Elizabeth would wonder, and probably would blame her; and though her resolution was not to be shaken, her feelings must be hurt by such a disapprobation. She resolved to give her the information herself; and therefore charged Mr. Collins, when he returned to Longbourn to dinner, to drop no hint of what had passed before any of the family. A promise of secrecy was of course very dutifully given, but it could not be kept without difficulty; for the curiosity excited by his long absence burst forth in such very direct questions on his return, as required some ingenuity to evade, and he was at the same time exercising great self-denial, for he was longing to publish his prosperous love.\n",

The younger daughters hoped to be introduced into society a year or two sooner than they might otherwise have been able, and the sons were freed from the concern that Charlotte might live out her life unmarried. Charlotte herself was reasonably composed. She had accomplished her objective and took time to consider it. Her reflections were mostly satisfactory. Mr. Collins, undeniably, was neither intelligent nor pleasant; his company was tiresome, and his feelings for her seemed purely imagined. Yet, he would still be her husband. Despite not holding high regard for either men or the institution of marriage, getting married had always been her aim; it was the only respectable path for educated young women with limited means, and even if uncertain to bring happiness, it was the surest protection against poverty. She had now acquired this safeguard, and at twenty-seven years old, not being considered beautiful, she truly felt the benefit of it. The most uncomfortable part of the matter was the surprise it would inevitably cause Elizabeth Bennet, whose friendship she valued more highly than anyone else's. Elizabeth would be astonished and likely critical; and though Charlotte's resolve was unshaken, her feelings would certainly be wounded by such disapproval. She decided to deliver the news to Elizabeth herself; therefore, she instructed Mr. Collins, upon his return to Longbourn for dinner, not to hint at what had happened before any of the family members. He gave a promise of secrecy, as was proper, but keeping it proved difficult, as the curiosity aroused by his long absence prompted very direct questions upon his return that were hard to sidestep, and he was simultaneously exerting considerable self-control, eager as he was to announce his successful courtship.",

The younger sisters hoped this meant they could join society a little earlier than expected, and the boys were glad that Charlotte would not become an old maid. Charlotte herself remained fairly calm. She had achieved her goal and could now reflect on it. Her thoughts were generally positive. While Mr. Collins was neither intelligent nor pleasant, and spending time with him was tedious—his affection for her probably imagined—he would nonetheless be her husband. Charlotte had never had a high opinion of men or marriage, but securing a marriage had always been her ambition. For young women with little money but good education, marriage was considered the most respectable way to be provided for; even if it did not guarantee happiness, it was the surest way to avoid poverty. She now had this security, and at twenty-seven, without ever having been considered pretty, she felt very fortunate. The only unpleasant part was the shock it would give Elizabeth Bennet, whose friendship she treasured most. Elizabeth would be surprised and likely disapprove; and though Charlotte’s decision was firm, she would be hurt by Elizabeth’s opinion. Charlotte decided to tell Elizabeth herself, so she insisted that Mr. Collins not mention anything to the Bennet family when he returned to Longbourn. He readily promised to keep the secret, but it was not easy; his long absence had aroused curiosity, leading to direct questions when he got back. It took all his restraint and cleverness to avoid giving away his happy news, for he was eager to announce his romantic success."

Miss Lucas called soon after breakfast, and in a private conference with Elizabeth related the event of the day before.\nThe possibility of Mr. Collins’s fancying himself in love with her friend had once occurred to Elizabeth within the last day or two: but that Charlotte could encourage him seemed almost as far from possibility as that she could encourage him herself; and her astonishment was consequently so great as to overcome at first the bounds of decorum, and she could not help crying out,—\n“Engaged to Mr. Collins! my dear Charlotte, impossible!”\nThe steady countenance which Miss Lucas had commanded in telling her story gave way to a momentary confusion here on receiving so direct a reproach; though, as it was no more than she expected, she soon regained her composure, and calmly replied,—\n“Why should you be surprised, my dear Eliza? Do you think it incredible that Mr. Collins should be able to procure any woman’s good opinion, because he was not so happy as to succeed with you?”\nBut Elizabeth had now recollected herself; and, making a strong effort for it, was able to assure her, with tolerable firmness, that the prospect of their relationship was highly grateful to her, and that she wished her all imaginable happiness.\n“I see what you are feeling,” replied Charlotte; “you must be surprised, very much surprised, so lately as Mr. Collins was wishing to marry you. But when you have had time to think it all over, I hope you will be satisfied with what I have done. I am not romantic, you know. I never was. I ask only a comfortable home; and, considering Mr. Collins’s character, connections, and situation in life, I am convinced that my chance of happiness with him is as fair as most people can boast on entering the marriage state.”",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "After polite farewells, the women left, all equally taken aback that he intended to come back so quickly. Mrs. Bennet hoped this meant he was considering proposing to one of her younger daughters, and she thought Mary might be persuaded to accept him. Mary, in particular, thought much more highly of his mental capabilities than the others did, finding his thoughts often substantial. While not considering him as smart as herself, she believed he could become a very pleasant companion if she guided his reading and self-improvement based on her example. However, all such hopes were dashed the next morning. Miss Lucas arrived soon after breakfast and, in a private chat with Elizabeth, recounted the events of the previous day. Elizabeth had briefly thought in the last day or two that Mr. Collins might imagine himself in love with her friend, but the possibility of Charlotte encouraging him seemed almost as unlikely as her encouraging him herself. As a result, her astonishment was so great that it initially exceeded polite bounds, and she couldn't help but cry out, \"Engaged to Mr. Collins! My dear Charlotte, that's impossible!\" Miss Lucas's calm demeanor while telling her story momentarily broke upon receiving such a direct criticism, although she quickly recovered, as it was no more than she had expected. She then calmly replied, \"Why are you surprised, my dear Eliza? Do you find it unbelievable that Mr. Collins could gain any woman's favourable opinion, simply because he was not lucky enough to succeed with you?\" By now, Elizabeth had regained her composure. Making a significant effort, she managed to assure her, with reasonable steadiness, that the prospect of their union was very welcome to her, and she wished her all possible happiness. \"I see what you are feeling,\" Charlotte responded. \"You must be surprised, very much surprised, especially since Mr. Collins was wanting to marry you so recently. But after you've had time to consider everything, I hope you will be satisfied with what I have done. I am not romantic, you know; I never was. I only desire a secure home. And, given Mr. Collins's personality, social connections, and position in life, I am convinced that my opportunity for happiness with him is as good as what most people can boast when entering marriage.\"",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "After exchanging polite farewells, the ladies left, all equally amazed to learn that Mr. Collins planned to return soon. Mrs. Bennet interpreted this as a sign that he intended to propose to one of her younger daughters, and Mary could have been persuaded to accept him. Mary thought highly of his intellect, perceiving a depth in his thinking that impressed her. Although she did not consider him as clever as herself, she believed that, with encouragement and exposure to her own example, he could become a pleasant companion. However, the next morning quashed these hopes when Miss Lucas visited after breakfast and privately told Elizabeth about the events of the previous day.\nElizabeth had briefly considered that Mr. Collins might become interested in her friend, but the idea that Charlotte would reciprocate seemed almost impossible—just as unlikely as she herself doing so. Therefore, Elizabeth was so shocked that she momentarily forgot her manners and exclaimed, \"Engaged to Mr. Collins! My dear Charlotte, that can't be!\"\nMiss Lucas, who had maintained her composure while telling the story, became briefly unsettled by Elizabeth's direct reaction, but, having anticipated it, quickly regained her calm and replied, \"Why are you so surprised, Eliza? Do you think it's impossible for Mr. Collins to win any woman's approval just because he didn't succeed with you?\"\nElizabeth regained her self-control and managed to tell Charlotte, with reasonable steadiness, that she was pleased for them and wished them much happiness.\nCharlotte responded, \"I understand why you're so surprised, especially since Mr. Collins wanted to marry you just recently. But once you have had time to reflect on it, I hope you'll see that I've made a sensible decision. I'm not a romantic; I never have been. I just want a comfortable home, and considering Mr. Collins's circumstances and connections, I believe my chances for happiness with him are as good as most people's when they marry.\""

It was very strange that he should come to Longbourn instead of to Lucas Lodge; it was also very inconvenient and exceedingly troublesome. She hated having visitors in the house while her health was so indifferent, and lovers were of all people the most disagreeable. Such were the gentle murmurs of Mrs. Bennet, and they gave way only to the greater distress of Mr. Bingley’s continued absence.\nNeither Jane nor Elizabeth were comfortable on this subject. Day after day passed away without bringing any other tidings of him than the report which shortly prevailed in Meryton of his coming no more to Netherfield the whole winter; a report which highly incensed Mrs. Bennet, and which she never failed to contradict as a most scandalous falsehood.\nEven Elizabeth began to fear—not that Bingley was indifferent—but that his sisters would be successful in keeping him away. Unwilling as she was to admit an idea so destructive to Jane’s happiness, and so dishonourable to the stability of her lover, she could not prevent its frequently recurring. The united efforts of his two unfeeling sisters, and of his overpowering friend, assisted by the attractions of Miss Darcy and the amusements of London, might be too much, she feared, for the strength of his attachment.\nAs for Jane, her anxiety under this suspense was, of course, more painful than Elizabeth’s: but whatever she felt she was desirous of concealing; and between herself and Elizabeth, therefore, the subject was never alluded to. But as no such delicacy restrained her mother, an hour seldom passed in which she did not talk of Bingley, express her impatience for his arrival, or even require Jane to confess that if he did not come back she should think herself very ill-used. It needed all Jane’s steady mildness to bear these attacks with tolerable tranquillity.",

She found it very odd that he chose to come to Longbourn instead of Lucas Lodge, viewing it as inconvenient and very bothersome. She disliked having visitors, especially when her health was poor, and considered suitors the most unpleasant guests. These were Mrs. Bennet's mild complaints, but they were quickly replaced by her greater distress over Mr. Bingley's prolonged absence. This situation made both Jane and Elizabeth uncomfortable. Days passed with no news of him other than the rumour that soon spread in Meryton that he would not be returning to Netherfield at all that winter. This report greatly angered Mrs. Bennet, and she vehemently insisted it was a scandalous lie. Even Elizabeth began to worry – not about Bingley's feelings – but that his sisters might successfully prevent him from returning. Despite her reluctance to entertain an idea so damaging to Jane's happiness and so unfair to Bingley's commitment, the thought kept occurring to her. She feared that the combined efforts of his two cold-hearted sisters and his dominating friend, possibly aided by Miss Darcy's appeal and the distractions of London, might overpower the strength of his affection for Jane. For Jane, her anxiety during this period of uncertainty was, understandably, more painful than Elizabeth's. However, she was determined to hide whatever she felt, so she and Elizabeth never spoke about the topic together. Her mother, however, had no such reservations, and rarely did an hour pass without her talking about Bingley, expressing her impatience for his arrival, or even demanding that Jane confess she would feel very badly treated if he did not come back. It required all of Jane's unfailing gentleness to bear these interactions with a degree of calmness.",

Mrs. Bennet disliked having guests when she wasn’t feeling well, and she especially disliked entertaining suitors, considering them the most tiresome of all. These mild complaints, however, were soon overshadowed by her greater distress over Mr. Bingley’s continued absence.\n\nNeither Jane nor Elizabeth felt at ease about the matter. Days went by with no news of Bingley except for a rumor spreading in Meryton that he would not return to Netherfield for the entire winter—a rumor that greatly angered Mrs. Bennet, who always insisted it was a scandalous lie.\n\nElizabeth started to worry—not that Bingley was uninterested in Jane, but that his sisters might successfully prevent him from returning. Though she hesitated to admit anything that would hurt Jane or question Bingley’s constancy, the thought kept coming back to her. She feared that the combined influence of Bingley’s heartless sisters, his powerful friend, the attractions of Miss Darcy, and the entertainments of London might overpower his affection for Jane.\n\nJane, of course, felt even more anxious during this period of uncertainty, but she tried hard not to show how she felt, so she and Elizabeth never discussed the subject. Mrs. Bennet, however, had no such restraint and talked about Bingley constantly—impatient for his return and sometimes insisting that Jane admit she would be badly treated if he didn’t come back. Jane’s consistent gentleness was tested as she endured her mother’s frequent complaints."

That he was really fond of Jane, she doubted no more than she had ever done; and much as she had always been disposed to like him, she could not think without anger, hardly without contempt, on that easiness of temper, that want of proper resolution, which now made him the slave of his designing friends, and led him to sacrifice his own happiness to the caprice of their inclinations. Had his own happiness, however, been the only sacrifice, he might have been allowed to sport with it in whatever manner he thought best; but her sister’s was involved in it, as she thought he must be sensible himself. It was a subject, in short, on which reflection would be long indulged, and must be unavailing. She could think of nothing else; and yet, whether Bingley’s regard had really died away, or were suppressed by his friends’ interference; whether he had been aware of Jane’s attachment, or whether it had escaped his observation; whichever were the case, though her opinion of him must be materially affected by the difference, her sister’s situation remained the same, her peace equally wounded.\n",

She was as convinced as she had always been that he genuinely cared for Jane. And despite having generally liked him, she couldn't help but think with anger, bordering on contempt, about his weak will and lack of resolution, qualities that now allowed his manipulative friends to control him and caused him to abandon his own happiness to satisfy their desires. However, if only his own happiness were being sacrificed, he might have been free to handle it as he saw fit; but her sister's happiness was at stake, which Elizabeth believed he must have realized himself. It was, in essence, a subject that would occupy her thoughts for a long time, but ultimately to no avail. She couldn't focus on anything else. Yet, regardless of whether Bingley's feelings had genuinely disappeared or were stifled by his friends' interference, and whether he had been aware of Jane's feelings or remained oblivious, whichever the truth, though her view of him would be significantly altered by the difference, her sister's situation remained unchanged, her sense of peace equally wounded.",

Although Elizabeth had always liked Bingley, she was now angry—and almost scornful—at his lack of resolve and his willingness to let his manipulative friends control him, making him give up his happiness for theirs. If only his own happiness were at stake, it would be his decision to risk it however he liked; but since Jane was affected, Elizabeth felt he should realize the impact of his actions. The matter gave her much to think about, though she knew her reflections were useless. She could focus on nothing else, and whether Bingley’s love had truly faded or was merely suppressed by his friends, or whether he knew Jane cared or remained oblivious—whatever the truth, Elizabeth thought, no matter how her view of Bingley changed, Jane’s suffering was the same."

Jane then asked if she still maintained that his sisters influenced him. Elizabeth affirmed this, stating they acted in conjunction with his friend. Jane found this hard to accept, questioning why they would try to influence him when they should only want his happiness, which, if he was attached to her, no other woman could provide. Elizabeth countered that Jane's initial premise was incorrect; the sisters might desire many things in addition to his happiness, such as increased wealth and social status, or for him to marry a woman with significant money, influential connections, and pride. Jane admitted they undoubtedly wanted him to choose Miss Darcy but suggested this might stem from better intentions than Elizabeth supposed, perhaps because they had known and loved her longer than they had known Jane. However, she insisted that regardless of their personal desires, it was highly improbable they would have opposed their brother's wishes unless there was something seriously objectionable. If they believed he was attached to Jane, they wouldn't have tried to separate them, and if he truly was, they couldn't have succeeded. By assuming such interference, Jane felt Elizabeth was portraying everyone as acting unnaturally and wrongly, causing her great unhappiness. She pleaded with Elizabeth not to distress her with this notion. She preferred to accept that she might have been mistaken, viewing this mistake as minor compared to the pain of having a negative opinion of him or his sisters. She wished to interpret the situation in the most favourable and understandable light. Elizabeth could not argue against such a request, and consequently, Mr. Bingley's name was rarely mentioned between them from that time on.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "Jane responded that she thought Elizabeth was being too harsh in her comments about both parties, and she hoped that seeing them happy together would change her mind. Jane then shifted the topic, asking Elizabeth not to blame someone or lower her opinion of him, urging her not to assume people mean to hurt them. Jane cautioned that young men are not always cautious in their behavior, and sometimes women misinterpret admiration because of their own vanity. Elizabeth replied that men encourage such misunderstandings. Jane said that when done deliberately, it is inexcusable, but she didn’t believe intentional harm was common. Elizabeth clarified that she didn’t think Mr. Bingley acted out of malice, but that carelessness or lack of resolve could still cause pain. Jane asked if Elizabeth blamed Bingley for this, and Elizabeth answered that she did, but mainly for his lack of determination. Elizabeth warned she might upset Jane with her views about those Jane cared for, but Jane pressed on, questioning whether Elizabeth thought Bingley was influenced by his sisters. Elizabeth confirmed she did, believing his sisters and his friend influenced him. Jane doubted this, arguing they would only want what’s best for Bingley and that if he truly loved her, no one could separate them. Elizabeth countered that they might have other motives, such as wanting Bingley to marry a wealthy and well-connected woman. Jane admitted that the sisters probably preferred Miss Darcy, but suggested it stemmed from positive feelings and familiarity rather than anything negative. Jane found it unlikely that the sisters would actively oppose Bingley’s wishes unless they had a strong reason, and insisted that if Bingley truly cared for her, his sisters’ efforts would be futile. Jane didn’t want to think ill of others and preferred to interpret events in the best possible way. Elizabeth agreed to respect Jane’s wishes, and from then on, Mr. Bingley’s name was scarcely mentioned between them."

But these things happen so often! A young man, such as you describe Mr. Bingley, so easily falls in love with a pretty girl for a few weeks, and, when accident separates them, so easily forgets her, that these sort of inconstancies are very frequent.”\n“An excellent consolation in its way,” said Elizabeth; “but it will not do for us. We do not suffer by accident. It does not often happen that the interference of friends will persuade a young man of independent fortune to think no more of a girl whom he was violently in love with only a few days before.”\n“But that expression of ‘violently in love’ is so hackneyed, so doubtful, so indefinite, that it gives me very little idea. It is as often applied to feelings which arise only from a half hour’s acquaintance, as to a real, strong attachment. Pray, how violent was Mr. Bingley’s love?”\n“I never saw a more promising inclination; he was growing quite inattentive to other people, and wholly engrossed by her. Every time they met, it was more decided and remarkable.

But these things occur so frequently! A young man like the one you describe in Mr. Bingley, who falls easily for a pretty girl for a short time and then, when something separates them, forgets her just as easily, makes these kinds of wavering affections very common.\" \"That's a good comfort in its own way,\" Elizabeth replied, \"but it doesn't apply to our case. We aren't suffering due to chance. It's not typical for friends to successfully persuade a wealthy young man to stop thinking about a girl he was clearly very much in love with only a few days earlier.\" \"But that phrase 'very much in love' is so overused, so questionable, so unclear, that it gives me very little understanding,\" said Mrs. Gardiner. \"It's applied just as often to feelings arising from only a brief acquaintance as to a genuine, deep attachment. Please, how intensely was Mr. Bingley in love?\" \"I never witnessed a more encouraging sign of affection; he was becoming quite oblivious to everyone else and completely focused on her. Every time they met, his feelings seemed more certain and noticeable. At his own party, he upset two or three young ladies by not asking them to dance, and I even spoke to him twice myself without getting a reply. Could there possibly be better indicators?

A young man like Mr. Bingley, as you describe him, can quickly fall for a pretty girl, but if circumstances separate them, he just as quickly forgets her—these sorts of fleeting romances are very common.\" \n\nElizabeth responded, \"That's some comfort, but not for us. Our situation isn't about random chance. It's rare for friends to talk a wealthy young man out of pursuing a girl he was passionately interested in only days earlier.\"\n\nMrs. Gardiner replied, \"But that phrase 'passionately interested' is so overused and vague that it tells me little. People often use it for feelings that develop after just half an hour, as well as for deep, genuine attachment. Just how strong were Mr. Bingley's feelings?\"\n\nElizabeth answered, \"I've never seen a more promising attraction; he was paying less attention to everyone else and was focused only on her. Each time they met, his interest was more obvious. At his own ball, he offended two or three young women by not inviting them to dance, and I spoke to him twice myself but got no answer.

Seriously, I would have you be on your guard. Do not involve yourself, or endeavour to involve him, in an affection which the want of fortune would make so very imprudent. I have nothing to say against him: he is a most interesting young man; and if he had the fortune he ought to have, I should think you could not do better. But as it is—you must not let your fancy run away with you. You have sense, and we all expect you to use it. Your father would depend on your resolution and good conduct, I am sure. You must not disappoint your father.”\n“My dear aunt, this is being serious indeed.”\n“Yes, and I hope to engage you to be serious likewise.”\n“Well, then, you need not be under any alarm. I will take care of myself, and of Mr. Wickham too. He shall not be in love with me, if I can prevent it.”\n“Elizabeth, you are not serious now.”\n“I beg your pardon. I will try again. At present I am not in love with Mr. Wickham; no, I certainly am not. But he is, beyond all comparison, the most agreeable man I ever saw—and if he becomes really attached to me—I believe it will be better that he should not. I see the imprudence of it. Oh, that abominable Mr. Darcy! My father’s opinion of me does me the greatest honour; and I should be miserable to forfeit it. My father, however, is partial to Mr. Wickham. In short, my dear aunt, I should be very sorry to be the means of making any of you unhappy; but since we see, every day, that where there is affection young people are seldom withheld, by immediate want of fortune, from entering into engagements with each other, how can I promise to be wiser than so many of my fellow-creatures, if I am tempted, or how am I even to know that it would be wiser to resist? All that I can promise you, therefore, is not to be in a hurry. I will not be in a hurry to believe myself his first object. When I am in company with him, I will not be wishing. In short, I will do my best.”\n“Perhaps it will be as well if you discourage his coming here so very often. At least you should not remind your mother of inviting him.”\n“As I did the other day,” said Elizabeth, with a conscious smile; “very true, it will be wise in me to refrain from that. But do not imagine that he is always here so often. It is on your account that he has been so frequently invited this week. You know my mother’s ideas as to the necessity of constant company for her friends. But really, and upon my honour, I will try to do what I think to be wisest; and now I hope you are satisfied.”\nHer aunt assured her that she was; and Elizabeth, having thanked her for the kindness of her hints, they parted,—a wonderful instance of advice being given on such a point without being resented.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "Mrs. Gardiner kindly and promptly gave Elizabeth her warning during their first chance to speak privately. After being frank about her concerns, she continued: 'Lizzy, you are too level-headed to fall in love just because you are warned against it, so I am comfortable speaking openly. Seriously, I need you to be cautious. Do not get yourself involved, or try to involve him, in a relationship that would be highly impractical due to lack of money. I have no personal objections to him; he is a very engaging young man, and if he had the fortune he deserves, I would think you could not find anyone better. But as it stands, you must not let your imagination get the better of you. You have good sense, and we all expect you to use it. I am sure your father relies on your good judgment and behaviour. You must not disappoint your father.' 'My dear aunt,' Elizabeth replied, 'this is indeed serious.' 'Yes,' said Mrs. Gardiner, 'and I hope to persuade you to be serious as well.' 'Well, then,' Elizabeth answered, 'you need not be concerned at all. I will look after myself, and Mr. Wickham too. He shall not fall in love with me, if I can help it.' 'Elizabeth,' her aunt said, 'you are not being serious now.' 'I beg your pardon. I will try again. At present, I am not in love with Mr. Wickham; no, I am certainly not. But he is, without a doubt, the most charming man I have ever met—and if he were to become truly attached to me—I believe it would be better if he did not. I recognize the imprudence of it. Oh, that hateful Mr. Darcy! My father’s high opinion of me does me the greatest credit, and I would be wretched to lose it. My father, however, is quite partial to Mr. Wickham. In short, my dear aunt, I would be very sorry to cause any of you unhappiness; but seeing how young people are seldom stopped by immediate lack of money from entering into commitments when they are in love, how can I promise to be wiser than so many others if I am tempted? Or how am I even to know that resisting would be the wiser course? Therefore, all I can promise you is not to act hastily. I will not be quick to believe I am his first object. When I am with him, I will not indulge in wishful thinking. In essence, I will do my best.' 'Perhaps it would be advisable if you discouraged his visiting so very often,' Mrs. Gardiner suggested. 'At the very least, you should not remind your mother to invite him.' 'As I did the other day,' Elizabeth said with a knowing smile; 'that is very true, it would be sensible of me to refrain from that. But do not imagine that he is always here so often. It is because of your visit that he has been invited so frequently this week. You know my mother’s belief in the necessity of providing constant company for her guests. But truly, and upon my honour, I will try to do what I think is wisest; and now I hope you are satisfied.'

          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "Mrs. Gardiner took the first opportunity she had alone with Elizabeth to kindly and thoroughly give her some advice. After honestly sharing her thoughts, she continued: “Lizzy, you’re too sensible to fall in love just because someone tells you not to, so I feel comfortable being direct with you. Seriously, I want you to be careful. Don’t get yourself, or try to get Mr. Wickham, into a relationship that wouldn’t be wise because of a lack of money. I have nothing against him—as a young man, he’s very appealing, and if he had the wealth he deserves, I’d think you couldn’t do any better. But as things stand, you shouldn’t let your imagination get carried away. You have good sense, and everyone expects you to use it. Your father, especially, trusts in your judgment and behavior. Please don’t let him down.”\n\nElizabeth replied, “My dear aunt, you really are being serious.”\n\n“Yes, and I hope you’ll be serious about it too,” her aunt responded.\n\nElizabeth reassured her, “There’s no need for you to worry. I’ll look after myself, and I’ll be careful about Mr. Wickham too—he won’t fall in love with me if I can help it.”\n\nMrs. Gardiner said, “Elizabeth, now you’re not being serious.”\n\nElizabeth admitted, “I’m sorry. Let me try again. I’m not in love with Mr. Wickham, at least not yet. But he is, by far, the most charming man I’ve ever met—and if he does become attached to me, I suppose it would be best for him not to. I can see how it would be unwise. Oh, that dreadful Mr. Darcy! I really value my father’s good opinion, and I’d be miserable if I lost it. But my father actually likes Mr. Wickham. Anyway, I’d be very upset to make any of you unhappy; but since we see so often that young people, when they’re in love, aren’t stopped by not having money, how can I expect to be any wiser than anyone else if I’m tempted, or even know if it would be wiser to resist? All I can promise is that I’ll take things slowly. I won’t be quick to believe that I’m his top priority. When I’m with him, I’ll be careful not to daydream too much. In short, I’ll do my best.”\n\nMrs. Gardiner then suggested, “Maybe it would be better if you discourage him from visiting so often. At least, don’t remind your mother to invite him.”\n\nElizabeth smiled knowingly and replied, “Like I did the other day—that’s true, it would be wise not to do that. But don’t think he’s always here so much; he’s been invited often this week for your sake. You know my mother thinks friends need constant company. But honestly, I’ll try to do what’s best. I hope you’re satisfied now.”\n\nHer aunt assured her she was, and after Elizabeth thanked her for the kind advice, they parted—an example of advice given on such a subject without causing offence."

          "text_segment": "Four weeks passed away, and Jane saw nothing of him. She endeavoured to persuade herself that she did not regret it; but she could no longer be blind to Miss Bingley’s inattention. After waiting at home every morning for a fortnight, and inventing every evening a fresh excuse for her, the visitor did at last appear; but the shortness of her stay, and, yet more, the alteration of her manner, would allow Jane to deceive herself no longer. The letter which she wrote on this occasion to her sister will prove what she felt:—\n“My dearest Lizzy will, I am sure, be incapable of triumphing in her better judgment, at my expense, when I confess myself to have been entirely deceived in Miss Bingley’s regard for me. But, my dear sister, though the event has proved you right, do not think me obstinate if I still assert that, considering what her behaviour was, my confidence was as natural as your suspicion. I do not at all comprehend her reason for wishing to be intimate with me; but, if the same circumstances were to happen again, I am sure I should be deceived again. Caroline did not return my visit till yesterday; and not a note, not a line, did I receive in the meantime. When she did come, it was very evident that she had no pleasure in it; she made a slight, formal apology for not calling before, said not a word of wishing to see me again, and was, in every respect, so altered a creature, that when she went away I was perfectly resolved to continue the acquaintance no longer. I pity, though I cannot help blaming, her. She was very wrong in singling me out as she did; I can safely say, that every advance to intimacy began on her side. But I pity her, because she must feel that she has been acting wrong, and because I am very sure that anxiety for her brother is the cause of it. I need not explain myself farther; and though we know this anxiety to be quite needless, yet if she feels it, it will easily account for her behaviour to me; and so deservedly dear as he is to his sister, whatever anxiety she may feel on his behalf is natural and amiable. I cannot but wonder, however, at her having any such fears now, because if he had at all cared about me, we must have met long, long ago. He knows of my being in town, I am certain, from something she said herself; and yet it would seem, by her manner of talking, as if she wanted to persuade herself that he is really partial to Miss Darcy. I cannot understand it. If I were not afraid of judging harshly, I should be almost tempted to say, that there is a strong appearance of duplicity in all this. I will endeavour to banish every painful thought, and think only of what will make me happy, your affection, and the invariable kindness of my dear uncle and aunt. Let me hear from you very soon. Miss Bingley said something of his never returning to Netherfield again, of giving up the house, but not with any certainty. We had better not mention it. I am extremely glad that you have such pleasant accounts from our friends at Hunsford. Pray go to see them, with Sir William and Maria. I am sure you will be very comfortable there.\n“Yours, etc.”",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "Four weeks passed without Jane seeing Mr. Bingley again. Although she tried to convince herself she wasn't bothered by this, she could no longer ignore Miss Bingley's lack of interest. After two weeks of waiting for her at home every morning and making up reasons for her absence each evening, Miss Bingley finally visited. However, the visit was brief, and her attitude had changed significantly, making it impossible for Jane to continue deceiving herself. The feelings Jane expressed on this occasion are shown in the letter she wrote to her sister: 'My dearest Lizzy, I am confident you won't be pleased about being proven right at my expense, but I must admit I was completely fooled by Miss Bingley's supposed regard for me. My dear sister, even though things turned out as you expected, please don't think me stubborn if I still maintain that, given her initial behaviour, my trust was as natural as your suspicion. I truly don't understand her motive for wanting to be close to me, but I'm certain that if the situation happened again, I would be misled once more. Caroline didn't return my visit until yesterday, and in the meantime, I didn't receive any message from her. When she finally came, it was obvious she didn't enjoy being here; she offered a brief, formal apology for not coming sooner, said nothing about wanting to see me again, and seemed so different in every way that by the time she left, I was absolutely resolved to end the acquaintance. I feel sorry for her, though I can't help but find fault with her actions. It was very wrong of her to single me out as she did; I can honestly say that every step towards intimacy was initiated by her. But I pity her because she must be aware she acted wrongly, and I am very sure that her anxiety for her brother is the reason behind it. I don't need to elaborate further; and although we know this concern is entirely unnecessary, if she feels it, it easily explains her conduct towards me. Considering how deservedly dear he is to his sister, any worry she feels on his behalf is understandable and commendable. Nevertheless, I can't help but wonder why she would have such fears now, because if he had cared for me even slightly, we would have met a long, long time ago. I am certain he knows I am in town, based on something she herself mentioned. Yet, from her way of talking, it seemed as if she was trying to convince herself that he is truly attracted to Miss Darcy. I cannot make sense of it. If I weren't afraid of judging too harshly, I would almost be tempted to say that there is a strong suggestion of deceit in all of this. I will try my best to dismiss all upsetting thoughts and focus only on what brings me happiness: your affection and the unfailing kindness of my dear uncle and aunt. Please write back to me very soon. Miss Bingley mentioned something about him never returning to Netherfield and giving up the house, but it wasn't stated with any certainty. We had better not mention it. I am extremely pleased that you have received such positive news from our friends at Hunsford. Please do go and visit them with Sir William and Maria. I am sure you will be very comfortable there. Yours, etc.'",

Jane stayed home every morning for two weeks in hopes of a visit, making up nightly excuses for her friend's absence. Eventually, Miss Bingley did call, but her visit was brief, and her changed behavior made it impossible for Jane to deceive herself any longer. Jane wrote to her sister Lizzy, admitting she had been mistaken about Miss Bingley's friendship, though she insisted her trust was understandable given Miss Bingley's earlier actions. Jane was puzzled by Miss Bingley's desire for closeness since it now appeared false, and she stated she would likely be misled again if the situation repeated. Jane described how Miss Bingley delayed her visit, offered only a polite excuse, and seemed uninterested in renewing their acquaintance, prompting Jane to resolve not to pursue the friendship further. She pitied Miss Bingley as well as blamed her, suggesting that her concern for her brother was at the root of her behaviour. Jane also wondered why Miss Bingley would fear Jane's involvement with her brother, since he evidently did not care for Jane—he surely knew she was in town, yet made no effort to see her. Furthermore, Miss Bingley hinted he might never return to Netherfield, though nothing was certain. Jane ended her letter expressing happiness at the good news from their Hunsford friends, encouraging Lizzy to visit them and sending her love."

His apparent partiality had subsided, his attentions were over, he was the admirer of some one else. Elizabeth was watchful enough to see it all, but she could see it and write of it without material pain. Her heart had been but slightly touched, and her vanity was satisfied with believing that she would have been his only choice, had fortune permitted it. The sudden acquisition of ten thousand pounds was the most remarkable charm of the young lady to whom he was now rendering himself agreeable; but Elizabeth, less clear-sighted perhaps in this case than in Charlotte’s, did not quarrel with him for his wish of independence. Nothing, on the contrary, could be more natural; and, while able to suppose that it cost him a few struggles to relinquish her, she was ready to allow it a wise and desirable measure for both, and could very sincerely wish him happy.\nAll this was acknowledged to Mrs. Gardiner; and, after relating the circumstances, she thus went on:—“I am now convinced, my dear aunt, that I have never been much in love; for had I really experienced that pure and elevating passion, I should at present detest his very name, and wish him all manner of evil. But my feelings are not only cordial towards him, they are even impartial towards Miss King. I cannot find out that I hate her at all, or that I am in the least unwilling to think her a very good sort of girl. There can be no love in all this. My watchfulness has been effectual; and though I should certainly be a more interesting object to all my acquaintance, were I distractedly in love with him, I cannot say that I regret my comparative insignificance. Importance may sometimes be purchased too dearly. Kitty and Lydia take his defection much more to heart than I do.

The gentleman's evident interest in Elizabeth had faded, his courtship had ended, and he was now pursuing someone else. Elizabeth had been observant enough to notice all of this, but she found she could witness it and write about it without experiencing significant distress. Her feelings for him had only been superficial, and her ego was content with the belief that she would have been his preferred choice if their circumstances had been different. The sudden inheritance of ten thousand pounds was the primary appeal of the young woman he was now trying to impress; however, Elizabeth, perhaps less astute in judging this situation than she had been with Charlotte's, did not resent him for desiring financial independence. On the contrary, she found his actions entirely understandable; and, assuming that giving her up had caused him some difficulty, she was willing to accept it as a sensible and beneficial decision for both of them, and she sincerely wished him happiness.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "Around this time, Mrs. Gardiner reminded Elizabeth of her promise to update her about that gentleman, and asked for any news. Elizabeth had information to share that would be more pleasing to her aunt than to herself. The man's evident interest had faded; he was no longer attentive and had started courting another woman. Elizabeth noticed this clearly, but was able to observe and write about it without much distress. She had not been deeply affected emotionally, and her pride was content with thinking she would have been his first choice if not for financial factors. The main attraction of the woman he was now pursuing was her sudden fortune of ten thousand pounds; however, Elizabeth didn't blame him for seeking financial independence, even if she wasn't as perceptive about his motives as she had been with Charlotte's situation. Rather, she thought his decision was perfectly natural, and while she supposed it may have been difficult for him to move on from her, she considered it a wise and sensible choice for both of them, and sincerely wished him well. Elizabeth admitted all this to Mrs. Gardiner, and after describing the events, added: 'I now realize, dear aunt, that I was never very much in love, for if I had known that deep and uplifting passion, I would by now despise him and wish him misfortune. Instead, my feelings for him are warm, and I feel no animosity towards Miss King. I can't bring myself to dislike her, and I even think she seems a good person. Clearly, there's no love in this. Watching the situation unfold has protected me, and though I'd probably be more intriguing to my friends if I were passionately in love, I do not regret my lack of significance. Sometimes, to be important comes at too high a cost. In fact, Kitty and Lydia are more upset by his change of heart than I am. They are young and inexperienced, not yet aware of the disappointing truth that good-looking young men need money to live on, just like plain ones.'"

Mrs. Collins welcomed her friend with genuine warmth and delight, and Elizabeth felt increasingly pleased she had made the journey, given the affectionate reception she received. Elizabeth immediately noticed that her cousin's demeanor had not been altered by his marriage; his polite but stiff manner was exactly as it had always been. He held her at the gate for a few minutes to ask detailed questions about her family, which he insisted on having answered. After he briefly highlighted the tidiness of the entrance, they were finally escorted into the house. As soon as they were settled in the parlor, he welcomed them for a second time with overly formal language to his \"humble abode,\" and carefully repeated his wife's offers of something to drink or eat.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "Everything that Elizabeth saw on the journey the next day was unfamiliar and captivating to her, and she was in high spirits; seeing her sister so healthy had eased her worries, and the upcoming trip to the north filled her with ongoing happiness. When they turned off the main road onto the lane leading to Hunsford, everyone eagerly looked out for the Parsonage, expecting to spot it around each new bend. On one side, the fence of Rosings park marked their border. Remembering the stories she'd heard about those living there made Elizabeth smile. Finally, they could see the Parsonage. The garden sloped down to the road, with the house nestled inside, bordered by green fences and a laurel hedge—clear signs that they had arrived. Mr. Collins and Charlotte showed up at the door, and the carriage stopped at the small gate, leading by a short gravel path to the house, as everyone nodded and smiled with excitement. In a moment, the whole group was out of the carriage, delighted to see one another. Mrs. Collins greeted Elizabeth warmly, making her feel glad she'd come by welcoming her with such affection. Elizabeth immediately noticed that her cousin's behavior hadn't changed since he got married; Mr. Collins was as stiffly polite as ever, keeping her at the gate for several minutes to ask about her entire family. After this brief delay, during which Mr. Collins pointed out how tidy the entrance was, they were shown into the house. Once in the parlor, he greeted them again with exaggerated formality, proud of his modest home, and repeated all his wife's offers of refreshments."

But though everything seemed neat and comfortable, she was not able to gratify him by any sigh of repentance; and rather looked with wonder at her friend, that she could have so cheerful an air with such a companion. When Mr. Collins said anything of which his wife might reasonably be ashamed, which certainly was not seldom, she involuntarily turned her eye on Charlotte. Once or twice she could discern a faint blush; but in general Charlotte wisely did not hear. After sitting long enough to admire every article of furniture in the room, from the sideboard to the fender, to give an account of their journey, and of all that had happened in London, Mr. Collins invited them to take a stroll in the garden, which was large and well laid out, and to the cultivation of which he attended himself. To work in his garden was one of his most respectable pleasures; and Elizabeth admired the command of countenance with which Charlotte talked of the healthfulness of the exercise, and owned she encouraged it as much as possible. Here, leading the way through every walk and cross walk, and scarcely allowing them an interval to utter the praises he asked for, every view was pointed out with a minuteness which left beauty entirely behind. He could number the fields in every direction, and could tell how many trees there were in the most distant clump. But of all the views which his garden, or which the country or the kingdom could boast, none were to be compared with the prospect of Rosings, afforded by an opening in the trees that bordered the park nearly opposite the front of his house.

She couldn't shake the feeling that in highlighting the room's good size, layout, and furniture, he was speaking specifically to her, perhaps wanting her to realize what she had sacrificed by refusing him. However, although everything seemed tidy and pleasant, she was unable to give him the pleasure of seeing her show any sign of repentance. Instead, she looked at her friend Charlotte with astonishment, marveling that she could maintain such a cheerful attitude with him. Whenever Mr. Collins said something his wife might reasonably be ashamed of – which certainly wasn't infrequent – Elizabeth instinctively glanced at Charlotte. Occasionally, she caught a faint blush, but mostly Charlotte wisely pretended not to hear. After spending ample time admiring every piece of furniture in the room, from the sideboard to the fireplace fender, and recounting their travels and experiences in London, Mr. Collins suggested they take a walk in the garden. The garden was large and well-planned, and he took care of its cultivation himself. Tending his garden was one of his most valued enjoyments, and Elizabeth admired Charlotte's ability to keep a straight face while speaking of the exercise's healthfulness and claiming she encouraged it as much as possible. Here, guiding them through every walkway and path, and allowing them barely any opportunity to offer the compliments he sought, he pointed out every view with a level of detail that completely overshadowed its beauty. He could count the number of fields in every direction and tell them precisely how many trees were in the most distant group. But among all the sights his garden, the countryside, or the entire kingdom could offer, none were considered as fine as the prospect of Rosings, visible through an opening in the trees that lined the park nearly opposite the front of his house. Rosings itself was described as a handsome, modern structure, nicely positioned on elevated ground.",

Even though everything looked tidy and comfortable, Elizabeth felt no regret for her decision and instead was amazed that her friend Charlotte could seem so cheerful with a husband like Mr. Collins. Whenever Mr. Collins said something embarrassing, which happened often enough, Elizabeth instinctively glanced at Charlotte, and occasionally saw her blush a little, though most of the time Charlotte wisely ignored her husband's remarks. After spending enough time admiring every piece of furniture and catching up on their trip and news from London, Mr. Collins invited them for a walk in the spacious and well-maintained garden, where he personally tended to the plants. Gardening was one of his few admirable pleasures, and Elizabeth admired how calmly Charlotte spoke about how healthy the hobby was, saying she encouraged him to do it as much as he wanted. Mr. Collins led them tirelessly along every path, eagerly pointing out each feature in such exhaustive detail that any true beauty was lost. He could count and name every field and tree, even those far away. But for him, no view in the area—or even in the country—could compare to the sight of the grand Rosings estate, visible through a gap in the trees across from his house. Rosings itself was a fine modern mansion situated on a hill."

Elizabeth, having other thoughts (implied, regarding Mr. Darcy), remarked on Miss De Bourgh's appearance, saying she looked unwell and ill-tempered, concluding that she would be a perfectly suitable wife for him. Mr. Collins and Charlotte were standing at the gate talking with the visiting ladies, while Sir William, much to Elizabeth's amusement, stood in the doorway, intently observing the important company and bowing repeatedly whenever Miss De Bourgh looked in his direction. After everything was said, the ladies drove off, and the others returned inside the house. As soon as Mr. Collins saw the two girls, he immediately congratulated them on their good luck, which Charlotte explained by informing them that everyone had been invited to dinner at Rosings the following day.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "\"Is that all?\" Elizabeth exclaimed. \"I was expecting something much more exciting—perhaps the pigs had gotten into the garden—but instead, it's only Lady Catherine and her daughter!\"\n\n\"Oh dear, you are mistaken,\" said Maria, surprised at Elizabeth's error. \"That isn't Lady Catherine. The older woman is Mrs. Jenkinson, who lives with them. The younger one is Miss De Bourgh. Just look at her—she’s such a tiny thing! Who would have imagined she’d be so slight and small!\"\n\n\"It's terribly rude of her to keep Charlotte standing outside in this blustery weather. Why doesn't she invite her in?\"\n\n\"Charlotte says it’s rare for her to come inside. It's a great honor when Miss De Bourgh does come in.\"\n\n\"Her appearance appeals to me,\" said Elizabeth, her thoughts elsewhere. \"She looks unwell and irritable. Yes, I think she’ll suit him perfectly. She would make just the right wife for him.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Mr. Collins and Charlotte were by the gate, conversing with the ladies, and to Elizabeth’s amusement, Sir William positioned himself in the doorway, apparently in awe of the distinguished company, bowing every time Miss De Bourgh looked his way. \n\nEventually, as the conversation drew to a close, the ladies departed in their carriage and the rest returned indoors. Mr. Collins, upon seeing Elizabeth and Maria, immediately congratulated them on their luck, and Charlotte explained that they had all been invited to dine at Rosings the following day."

          "text_segment": "Mr. Collins's triumph, in consequence of this invitation, was complete. The power of displaying the grandeur of his patroness to his wondering visitors, and of letting them see her civility towards himself and his wife, was exactly what he had wished for; and that an opportunity of doing it should be given so soon was such an instance of Lady Catherine’s condescension as he knew not how to admire enough.\n“I confess,” said he, “that I should not have been at all surprised by her Ladyship’s asking us on Sunday to drink tea and spend the evening at Rosings. I rather expected, from my knowledge of her affability, that it would happen. But who could have foreseen such an attention as this? Who could have imagined that we should receive an invitation to dine there (an invitation, moreover, including the whole party) so immediately after your arrival?”\n“I am the less surprised at what has happened,” replied Sir William, “from that knowledge of what the manners of the great really are, which my situation in life has allowed me to acquire. About the court, such instances of elegant breeding are not uncommon.”\nScarcely anything was talked of the whole day or next morning but their visit to Rosings. Mr. Collins was carefully instructing them in what they were to expect, that the sight of such rooms, so many servants, and so splendid a dinner, might not wholly overpower them.\nWhen the ladies were separating for the toilette, he said to Elizabeth,—\n“Do not make yourself uneasy, my dear cousin, about your apparel. Lady Catherine is far from requiring that elegance of dress in us which becomes herself and daughter. I would advise you merely to put on whatever of your clothes is superior to the rest—there is no occasion for anything more. Lady Catherine will not think the worse of you for being simply dressed. She likes to have the distinction of rank preserved.”\nWhile they were dressing, he came two or three times to their different doors, to recommend their being quick, as Lady Catherine very much objected to be kept waiting for her dinner. Such formidable accounts of her Ladyship, and her manner of living, quite frightened Maria Lucas, who had been little used to company; and she looked forward to her introduction at Rosings with as much apprehension as her father had done to his presentation at St. James’s.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "Mr. Collins felt completely successful due to this invitation. Getting the chance to impress his guests by showing them how magnificent his patroness was, and letting them witness her graciousness towards him and his wife, was exactly what he desired. The fact that this chance came so quickly was an example of Lady Catherine’s kindness that he felt he couldn't praise enough. He admitted that he wouldn't have been surprised if her Ladyship had invited them for tea and the evening on Sunday, as he somewhat anticipated it given his understanding of her pleasant nature. However, he found this specific attention astonishing. He wondered who could have imagined receiving an invitation to dine there, and one that included everyone in the group, so soon after their arrival.\nSir William responded that he was less surprised by the event because his experience in life had taught him about the true customs of important people. He noted that such demonstrations of refined manners are quite common in court circles.\nAlmost all conversations that day and the following morning revolved around their upcoming visit to Rosings. Mr. Collins diligently prepared them for what to anticipate, hoping that the sight of the elaborate rooms, numerous servants, and lavish meal wouldn't entirely overwhelm them.\nAs the women prepared for dinner, he addressed Elizabeth, telling her not to worry about her clothing. He explained that Lady Catherine doesn't expect her visitors to dress with the same level of elegance that she and her daughter possess. He suggested she simply wear her nicest available outfit, as nothing more was necessary. Lady Catherine, he assured her, would not judge her negatively for being plainly dressed, as she preferred to maintain clear distinctions in social rank.\nWhile they were getting dressed, he frequently visited their doors to encourage them to hurry, mentioning that Lady Catherine strongly disliked being kept waiting for her dinner. These intimidating descriptions of her Ladyship and her way of life significantly unnerved Maria Lucas, who wasn't accustomed to social events. Consequently, she anticipated her formal introduction at Rosings with as much anxiety as her father had felt before his presentation at St. James's.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "Mr. Collins was absolutely thrilled by being invited, as it gave him the perfect chance to show his guests just how important his patroness was and to demonstrate how polite she was to him and his wife—exactly what he had hoped for. That this opportunity arose so quickly after their arrival struck him as a remarkable act of Lady Catherine’s kindness, and he could hardly express enough admiration for it. \n\nHe said, “Honestly, I wouldn’t have been surprised if her Ladyship had invited us to have tea and spend the evening at Rosings on Sunday—I almost expected it, given how gracious she is. But who could have predicted such a special gesture? Who would have thought we’d be invited to dinner, and that everyone in our group would be included, so soon after you’d arrived?”\n\nSir William replied, “I’m not as surprised, knowing something about how people of such status behave, thanks to my own experience. In high society, acts of refined courtesy like this aren’t unusual.”\n\nFor the rest of the day and the next morning, all anyone talked about was their upcoming visit to Rosings. Mr. Collins carefully prepared them for what they would see, so that neither the grandeur of the rooms, the number of servants, nor the elaborate dinner would overwhelm them.\n\nAs the women left to get dressed, he told Elizabeth, “Don’t worry yourself about your outfit, my dear cousin. Lady Catherine doesn’t expect us to match the level of elegance she and her daughter display. I’d just recommend you wear your nicest clothes—nothing more is necessary. She won’t think any less of you for being simply dressed—she prefers to keep social distinctions clear.”\n\nWhile they got ready, he visited their rooms a few times to remind them to hurry, since Lady Catherine strongly disliked having to wait for dinner. These intimidating descriptions of Lady Catherine and her lifestyle really unnerved Maria Lucas, who wasn’t used to high society, and she felt nearly as anxious about meeting Lady Catherine at Rosings as her father once had been about going to court at St. James’s."

As they ascended the steps leading to the hall, Maria's apprehension grew by the moment, and even Sir William did not appear entirely at ease. Elizabeth's composure remained. She had heard nothing about Lady Catherine indicating she was awe-inspiring due to exceptional abilities or extraordinary virtue, and she felt she could face someone whose prominence was based solely on wealth and social standing without fear. From the entrance hall, which Mr. Collins highlighted with ecstatic enthusiasm for its fine proportions and decorative features, they were guided by servants through an adjoining room to the parlour where Lady Catherine, her daughter, and Mrs. Jenkinson were present. Her Ladyship, displaying considerable graciousness, rose to greet them.

As they climbed the steps to the hall, Maria grew increasingly nervous, and even Sir William didn't seem completely at ease. Elizabeth, however, did not lose her composure. She had heard nothing about Lady Catherine that made the woman seem particularly fearsome for her abilities or virtues, and she believed she could face the dignity of wealth and rank without fear.

Elizabeth found herself quite equal to the scene, and could observe the three ladies before her composedly. Lady Catherine was a tall, large woman, with strongly-marked features, which might once have been handsome. Her air was not conciliating, nor was her manner of receiving them such as to make her visitors forget their inferior rank. She was not rendered formidable by silence: but whatever she said was spoken in so authoritative a tone as marked her self-importance, and brought Mr. Wickham immediately to Elizabeth’s mind; and, from the observation of the day altogether, she believed Lady Catherine to be exactly what he had represented.\nWhen, after examining the mother, in whose countenance and deportment she soon found some resemblance of Mr. Darcy, she turned her eyes on the daughter, she could almost have joined in Maria’s astonishment at her being so thin and so small. There was neither in figure nor face any likeness between the ladies. Miss de Bourgh was pale and sickly: her features, though not plain, were insignificant; and she spoke very little, except in a low voice, to Mrs. Jenkinson, in whose appearance there was nothing remarkable, and who was entirely engaged in listening to what she said, and placing a screen in the proper direction before her eyes.\nAfter sitting a few minutes, they were all sent to one of the windows to admire the view, Mr. Collins attending them to point out its beauties, and Lady Catherine kindly informing them that it was much better worth looking at in the summer.\nThe dinner was exceedingly handsome, and there were all the servants, and all the articles of plate which Mr. Collins had promised; and, as he had likewise foretold, he took his seat at the bottom of the table, by her Ladyship’s desire, and looked as if he felt that life could furnish nothing greater. He carved and ate and praised with delighted alacrity; and every dish was commended first by him, and then by Sir William, who was now enough recovered to echo whatever his son-in-law said, in a manner which Elizabeth wondered Lady Catherine could bear. But Lady Catherine seemed gratified by their excessive admiration, and gave most gracious smiles, especially when any dish on the table proved a novelty to them. The party did not supply much conversation. Elizabeth was ready to speak whenever there was an opening, but she was seated between Charlotte and Miss de Bourgh—the former of whom was engaged in listening to Lady Catherine, and the latter said not a word to her all the dinnertime. Mrs. Jenkinson was chiefly employed in watching how little Miss de Bourgh ate, pressing her to try some other dish and fearing she was indisposed. Maria thought speaking out of the question, and the gentlemen did nothing but eat and admire.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "Despite his past experience at court, Sir William was so overwhelmed by the grandeur around him that he barely had the nerve to perform a very deep bow and take his seat without speaking. His daughter, Maria, was so frightened she was nearly senseless, sitting stiffly on the edge of her chair, unsure where to look. Elizabeth, however, felt entirely composed and was able to calmly observe the three women before her. Lady Catherine was a tall, substantial woman with strongly defined facial features that might have once been considered attractive. Her manner was not welcoming, nor did the way she received them allow her visitors to forget their lower social standing. Her power wasn't due to silence; everything she said was spoken with such an authoritative tone that it emphasized her importance and immediately brought Mr. Wickham to Elizabeth's mind. Based on the entire day's observations, Elizabeth concluded Lady Catherine was exactly as Wickham had described her.\nAfter studying the mother, in whose appearance and behavior she soon noticed a resemblance to Mr. Darcy, she turned her attention to the daughter. Elizabeth could almost have shared Maria's surprise at Miss de Bourgh's thinness and small stature. The two women bore no physical likeness to each other. Miss de Bourgh was pale and looked unwell; her features, though not unattractive, were not striking, and she spoke very little, only in a quiet voice to Mrs. Jenkinson. Mrs. Jenkinson had an unremarkable appearance and was completely focused on listening to what Miss de Bourgh said and adjusting a screen correctly before her eyes.\nAfter sitting for a few minutes, they were all directed towards one of the windows to appreciate the view, with Mr. Collins accompanying them to highlight its beauty. Lady Catherine kindly added that it was much more impressive to see in the summer.\nThe dinner was exceptionally fine, with all the servants and silver items Mr. Collins had promised. As he had also predicted, he was asked to sit at the foot of the table by her Ladyship and looked as if he felt life offered nothing better. He carved, ate, and praised with enthusiastic readiness, commending every dish first, followed by Sir William. By now, Sir William had recovered sufficiently to repeat everything his son-in-law said, in a manner that made Elizabeth wonder how Lady Catherine could stand it. But Lady Catherine seemed pleased by their excessive admiration, giving very gracious smiles, especially when they found a dish on the table to be new. The group did not engage in much conversation. Elizabeth was prepared to speak whenever an opportunity arose, but she was seated between Charlotte and Miss de Bourgh—the former was busy listening to Lady Catherine, while the latter did not say a single word to her throughout dinner. Mrs. Jenkinson was primarily occupied with observing how little Miss de Bourgh ate, urging her to try another dish and fearing she might be ill. Maria felt speaking was out of the question, and the gentlemen did nothing but eat and express admiration.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "Despite having been presented at St. James’s, Sir William was so overawed by the grandeur around him that he scarcely had the nerve to bow deeply and silently take his seat; his daughter, nearly paralyzed with fear, perched anxiously at the edge of her chair, uncertain where to look. Elizabeth, however, remained calm and surveyed the three women before her without difficulty. Lady Catherine was tall and large, with striking features that may once have been attractive. Her demeanor was hardly welcoming, and her reception did nothing to make her guests feel comfortable about their lower status. Rather than her silence being intimidating, it was the commanding, authoritative manner with which she spoke that emphasized her self-importance, quickly reminding Elizabeth of Mr. Wickham’s comments about her; everything Elizabeth observed that day convinced her that his account had been entirely accurate.\n\nAfter scrutinizing Lady Catherine and noticing some resemblance to Mr. Darcy in her expression and behavior, Elizabeth looked to her daughter and almost shared Maria’s surprise at how frail and small she appeared. There was no similarity in looks or build between them. Miss de Bourgh was pale and delicate; while her features were not unattractive, they were unimpressive, and she said very little except in a quiet tone to Mrs. Jenkinson, whose own appearance was unremarkable and who was wholly focused on tending to Miss de Bourgh’s needs.\n\nAfter a short time, the visitors were directed to admire the view from one of the windows, accompanied by Mr. Collins highlighting its merits, while Lady Catherine pointed out that it was much more attractive in summer.\n\nThe meal was extremely lavish, exactly as Mr. Collins had promised, with all the staff and silverware on display. As predicted, he took his place at the end of the table at Lady Catherine’s request, looking thoroughly pleased, as if nothing in life could be finer. He served food, ate, and offered effusive praise for every dish, a sentiment readily echoed by Sir William, whose own composure had returned enough to parrot his son-in-law’s accolades, leaving Elizabeth bemused that Lady Catherine could tolerate it. However, Lady Catherine seemed pleased by their excessive admiration, smiling graciously, especially when her guests found something new in the meal. The gathering was not lively; Elizabeth was prepared to converse whenever the opportunity arose but found herself seated between Charlotte—absorbed in listening to Lady Catherine—and Miss de Bourgh, who did not speak to her at all during dinner. Mrs. Jenkinson busied herself with monitoring how little Miss de Bourgh ate and encouraging her to try different foods, fearing she might be unwell. Maria was too intimidated to join any conversation, and the gentlemen focused solely on eating and expressing admiration."

She inquired into Charlotte’s domestic concerns familiarly and minutely, and gave her a great deal of advice as to the management of them all; told her how everything ought to be regulated in so small a family as hers, and instructed her as to the care of her cows and her poultry. Elizabeth found that nothing was beneath this great lady’s attention which could furnish her with an occasion for dictating to others. In the intervals of her discourse with Mrs. Collins, she addressed a variety of questions to Maria and Elizabeth, but especially to the latter, of whose connections she knew the least, and who, she observed to Mrs. Collins, was a very genteel, pretty kind of girl. She asked her at different times how many sisters she had, whether they were older or younger than herself, whether any of them were likely to be married, whether they were handsome, where they had been educated, what carriage her father kept, and what had been her mother’s maiden name? Elizabeth felt all the impertinence of her questions, but answered them very composedly. Lady Catherine then observed,—\n“Your father’s estate is entailed on Mr. Collins, I think? For your sake,” turning to Charlotte, “I am glad of it; but otherwise I see no occasion for entailing estates from the female line. It was not thought necessary in Sir Lewis de Bourgh’s family. Do you play and sing, Miss Bennet?”",

She voiced her opinions on every topic with such authority that it was clear she wasn't accustomed to having her judgment challenged. She questioned Charlotte closely and informally about her household matters and offered a great deal of advice on how to manage everything. She told Charlotte specifically how a small family like hers should be organized and even instructed her on looking after her cows and poultry. Elizabeth observed that this important lady considered no detail too small if it gave her an opportunity to tell others what to do. When she paused her conversation with Mrs. Collins, she directed several questions to Maria and Elizabeth, focusing especially on Elizabeth, whose family she knew the least about. To Mrs. Collins, she remarked that Elizabeth seemed like a very polite and attractive young woman. At various points, she asked Elizabeth about the number of her sisters, whether they were older or younger, if any were likely to marry, their appearance, their education, what kind of carriage her father owned, and her mother’s maiden name. Although Elizabeth found the questions highly presumptuous, she answered them calmly. Lady Catherine then commented, “I believe your father’s estate is entailed on Mr. Collins? For your sake,” she said, turning to Charlotte, “I am happy about that; but otherwise, I don’t see why estates should be entailed away from the female line. It wasn’t deemed necessary in Sir Lewis de Bourgh’s family.” Finally, she asked, “Do you play music or sing, Miss Bennet?”",

Lady Catherine asked Charlotte many personal questions about her household and offered extensive advice on how to run it, explaining how everything should be managed in a small family and giving instructions about caring for cows and poultry. Elizabeth noticed that Lady Catherine paid attention to every detail that allowed her to instruct others. While talking with Mrs. Collins, Lady Catherine frequently questioned Maria and Elizabeth—focusing especially on Elizabeth, as she knew little about her, and remarked to Mrs. Collins that Elizabeth was a refined, attractive girl. She asked Elizabeth several questions about her siblings, their ages and prospects of marriage, whether they were attractive, their education, her father’s carriage, and her mother’s maiden name. Although Elizabeth found these questions intrusive, she answered them calmly. Lady Catherine then commented, \"Your father’s estate is entailed to Mr. Collins, isn’t it? For your sake, Charlotte, I’m pleased about that; but otherwise, I don’t see the reason for entailing estates away from daughters. That wasn’t necessary in Sir Lewis de Bourgh’s family.

Do your sisters play and sing?”\n“One of them does.”\n“Why did not you all learn? You ought all to have learned. The Miss Webbs all play, and their father has not so good an income as yours. Do you draw?”\n“No, not at all.”\n“What, none of you?”\n“Not one.”\n“That is very strange. But I suppose you had no opportunity. Your mother should have taken you to town every spring for the benefit of masters.”\n“My mother would have no objection, but my father hates London.”\n“Has your governess left you?”\n“We never had any governess.”\n“No governess! How was that possible? Five daughters brought up at home without a governess! I never heard of such a thing. Your mother must have been quite a slave to your education.”\nElizabeth could hardly help smiling, as she assured her that had not been the case.\n“Then who taught you? who attended to you? Without a governess, you must have been neglected.”\n“Compared with some families, I believe we were; but such of us as wished to learn never wanted the means. We were always encouraged to read, and had all the masters that were necessary. Those who chose to be idle certainly might.”\n“Ay, no doubt: but that is what a governess will prevent; and if I had known your mother, I should have advised her most strenuously to engage one. I always say that nothing is to be done in education without steady and regular instruction, and nobody but a governess can give it. It is wonderful how many families I have been the means of supplying in that way. I am always glad to get a young person well placed out. Four nieces of Mrs. Jenkinson are most delightfully situated through my means; and it was but the other day that I recommended another young person, who was merely accidentally mentioned to me, and the family are quite delighted with her. Mrs. Collins, did I tell you of Lady Metcalfe’s calling yesterday to thank me? She finds Miss Pope a treasure. ‘Lady Catherine,’ said she, ‘you have given me a treasure.’ Are any of your younger sisters out, Miss Bennet?”\n“Yes, ma’am, all.”\n“All! What, all five out at once? Very odd! And you only the second. The younger ones out before the elder are married! Your younger sisters must be very young?”\n“Yes, my youngest is not sixteen. Perhaps she is full young to be much in company. But really, ma’am, I think it would be very hard upon younger sisters that they should not have their share of society and amusement, because the elder may not have the means or inclination to marry early. The last born has as good a right to the pleasures of youth as the first. And to be kept back on such a motive! I think it would not be very likely to promote sisterly affection or delicacy of mind.”\n“Upon my word,” said her Ladyship, “you give your opinion very decidedly for so young a person. Pray, what is your age?”\n“With three younger sisters grown up,” replied Elizabeth, smiling, “your Ladyship can hardly expect me to own it.”\nLady Catherine seemed quite astonished at not receiving a direct answer; and Elizabeth suspected herself to be the first creature who had ever dared to trifle with so much dignified impertinence.\n“You cannot be more than twenty, I am sure,—therefore you need not conceal your age.”\n“I am not one-and-twenty.”",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "“A little,” Elizabeth replied. Lady Catherine responded, “Oh, well, we’d be pleased to hear you play at some point. Our piano is excellent, probably better than yours—you must try it one day. Do your sisters play or sing?” “One does,” Elizabeth said. “Why didn’t you all learn? You really should have. The Miss Webbs all play, and their father doesn’t have as much money as yours. Can you draw?” “No, not at all.” “What, none of you?” “Not one.” “That’s very odd. But I suppose you lacked the chance. Your mother ought to have brought you to London every spring for tutors.” Elizabeth explained, “My mother wouldn’t object, but my father dislikes London.” Lady Catherine asked, “Has your governess departed?” “We’ve never had a governess,” Elizabeth answered. “No governess! How could that be? Five daughters raised at home without one! I’ve never heard of such a thing. Your mother must have been completely dedicated to your schooling.” Elizabeth could barely suppress a smile as she assured her that wasn’t the case. “Then who instructed you? Who supervised you? Without a governess, you must have been neglected.” “Compared to some families, I believe we were,” Elizabeth admitted, “but those of us who wanted to learn always had the means. We were always encouraged to read and had all the necessary tutors. Those who preferred to be idle certainly could.” “Yes, naturally,” Lady Catherine conceded, “but that’s precisely what a governess prevents. Had I known your mother, I would have strongly urged her to hire one. I always maintain that nothing effective can be accomplished in education without consistent, structured teaching, and only a governess can provide that. It’s remarkable how many families I’ve helped secure governesses for. I’m always pleased to see a young person well-placed. Four nieces of Mrs. Jenkinson are wonderfully situated thanks to my assistance; and just recently, I recommended another young woman who was merely mentioned to me in passing, and the family is absolutely delighted with her. Mrs. Collins, did I mention Lady Metcalfe called yesterday specifically to thank me? She considers Miss Pope a treasure. ‘Lady Catherine,’ she told me, ‘you have given me a treasure.’ Are any of your younger sisters socially introduced, Miss Bennet?” “Yes, ma’am, all of them,” Elizabeth replied. “All! What, all five introduced into society simultaneously? Very peculiar! And you are only the second. The younger ones are out before the older ones are married! Your younger sisters must be quite young?” “Yes, my youngest isn’t yet sixteen,” said Elizabeth. “Perhaps she is quite young for much social activity. But truly, ma’am, I think it would be very unfair to younger sisters if they were denied their share of society and entertainment simply because the elder ones may not have the means or desire to marry early. The last born has just as much right to the joys of youth as the first. And to be held back for such a reason! I doubt it would foster much sisterly affection or refined character.” “Indeed,” said her Ladyship, “you express your opinion very assertively for someone so young. Tell me, what is your age?” “With three younger sisters grown up,” Elizabeth replied with a smile, “your Ladyship can hardly expect me to disclose it.” Lady Catherine appeared completely taken aback at not receiving a direct answer; and Elizabeth suspected she was the first person who had ever dared to treat such pompous rudeness with playful evasion. “You can’t be more than twenty, I’m certain,” Lady Catherine insisted, “so you don’t need to hide your age.” “I am not yet twenty-one,” Elizabeth stated.",

Without a governess, you must have been neglected.”\n\n“Perhaps compared to some families, but any of us who wanted to learn always had the means and encouragement to do so, with the necessary tutors.

She might be rather young to be out much.

To hold them back for that reason wouldn’t encourage sisterly love or refinement.”\n\n“Really,” Lady Catherine said, “you speak your mind quite strongly for someone so young. May I ask your age?”\n\n“With three younger sisters grown up,” Elizabeth replied with a smile, “surely you can’t expect me to admit it.”\n\nLady Catherine was surprised not to get a direct answer, and Elizabeth suspected she was the first to treat Lady Catherine’s imperious manner with such lightheartedness.\n\n“You can’t be more than twenty—so you needn’t hide your age.”\n\n“I’m not quite twenty-one.”"

While Sir William was with them, Mr. Collins devoted his mornings to driving him out in his gig, and showing him the country: but when he went away, the whole family returned to their usual employments, and Elizabeth was thankful to find that they did not see more of her cousin by the alteration; for the chief of the time between breakfast and dinner was now passed by him either at work in the garden, or in reading and writing, and looking out of window in his own book room, which fronted the road. The room in which the ladies sat was backwards. Elizabeth at first had rather wondered that Charlotte should not prefer the dining parlour for common use; it was a better sized room, and had a pleasanter aspect: but she soon saw that her friend had an excellent reason for what she did, for Mr. Collins would undoubtedly have been much less in his own apartment had they sat in one equally lively; and she gave Charlotte credit for the arrangement.\nFrom the drawing-room they could distinguish nothing in the lane, and were indebted to Mr. Collins for the knowledge of what carriages went along, and how often especially Miss De Bourgh drove by in her phaeton, which he never failed coming to inform them of, though it happened almost every day. She not unfrequently stopped at the Parsonage, and had a few minutes’ conversation with Charlotte, but was scarcely ever prevailed on to get out.",

While his father-in-law was present, Mr. Collins dedicated his mornings to taking him on carriage rides and showing him the surrounding area. But once he departed, the household resumed their regular activities, and Elizabeth was pleased to discover that the change did not lead to her spending more time with her cousin. This was because, for the majority of the time between morning meal and midday meal, Mr. Collins was now occupied either tending to the garden, or reading, writing, and observing the road from the window of his personal study, which faced the front of the property. The room where the women convened was situated at the rear. Elizabeth was initially a little surprised that Charlotte didn't opt for the dining room for everyday use, as it was a larger space and had a more pleasant outlook. Nevertheless, she soon understood that her friend had an excellent justification for her choice, as Mr. Collins would undoubtedly have spent considerably less time in his own private room if they had been sitting in a room that was equally inviting. She therefore approved of Charlotte's strategic planning. From the main sitting room, they had difficulty seeing anything in the nearby lane and had to rely on Mr. Collins for information regarding which carriages passed by, particularly how frequently Miss De Bourgh drove past in her phaeton, which he never failed to announce, despite it being an almost daily occurrence. She quite often paused at the Parsonage for a short conversation with Charlotte, but was seldom persuaded to disembark from her vehicle.",

While Sir William was visiting, Mr. Collins spent his mornings taking him out for drives in his gig and showing him the surrounding area. After Sir William left, the household returned to their normal routines, and Elizabeth was pleased to notice that her cousin did not spend more time with them because of the change; instead, Mr. Collins spent most of his time between breakfast and dinner gardening, reading, writing, or looking out the window of his study, which faced the road. The ladies used a room at the back of the house. At first, Elizabeth was surprised that Charlotte had not chosen the larger and nicer dining-parlour for their daily use, but she soon realized that Charlotte had a good reason; if the ladies had sat in a more attractive room, Mr. Collins would have likely spent less time in his own study, so Elizabeth respected Charlotte's decision. Because the ladies' drawing-room was at the back, they couldn't see what was happening in the lane, and had to rely on Mr. Collins for news of passing carriages and, in particular, for updates on how often Miss De Bourgh drove by in her carriage—a fact he never failed to interrupt them with, even though it was an almost daily occurrence. Miss De Bourgh would sometimes stop at the Parsonage for a brief chat with Charlotte, but she was rarely persuaded to come inside."

Really, Mr. Darcy, it's quite unkind of you to bring up everything you knew to my disadvantage from Hertfordshire—and, if I may say, rather unwise too—as you're provoking me to strike back, and things might come out that would shock your relatives.\" Smiling, he replied, \"I'm not afraid of you.\" Colonel Fitzwilliam eagerly chimed in, \"Oh, please, tell me what you have to accuse him of! I'd love to know how he acts around people he doesn't know.\" \"Very well, you shall hear—but brace yourself for something truly awful,\" Elizabeth began. \"The very first time I ever saw him in Hertfordshire, you must understand, was at a ball—and at this ball, can you believe what he did? He only danced four dances! It pains me to tell you, but it's true. He danced only four dances, despite gentlemen being scarce, and I know for a fact that more than one young lady was left sitting, needing a partner. Mr. Darcy, you can't deny this.\" \"At that moment,\" he replied, \"I didn't have the honour of knowing any lady at the assembly beyond my own group.\" \"Exactly; and introductions are simply impossible at a ball, aren't they?\" Elizabeth said, then turned back to Colonel Fitzwilliam, \"Well, Colonel Fitzwilliam, what piece should I play next? My fingers are waiting for your instruction.\" Darcy suggested, \"Perhaps I should have acted more wisely and sought introductions, but I'm not good at making a favourable impression on strangers.\" \"Shall we ask your cousin why?\" Elizabeth said, still addressing Colonel Fitzwilliam. \"Shall we ask him why a man with his intelligence, education, and worldly experience is supposedly bad at recommending himself to strangers?\" \"I can answer that for you,\" Fitzwilliam responded, \"without even needing to ask him. It's because he can't be bothered.\" Darcy said, \"I certainly lack the knack that some people have for conversing easily with those I've never met before. I can't pick up on their way of talking or appear interested in their affairs, as I often see others do.\" Elizabeth then remarked, regarding her playing, \"My fingers don't glide over this instrument with the impressive skill I see in so many other women's playing. They lack the same strength or speed and don't produce the same feeling. But then, I've always assumed it was my own fault—because I haven't made the effort to practice. It's not that I think my fingers aren't capable of playing as expertly as any other woman's.\" Darcy smiled and said, \"You are absolutely right. You have used your time much better. No one fortunate enough to hear you play could feel anything is missing. Neither of us performs for strangers.\"",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "Elizabeth laughed heartily at Darcy's unflattering description of her, then jokingly told Colonel Fitzwilliam that Darcy would give him quite an impression of her and make him doubt everything she said. She added she was unlucky to have met someone so able to reveal her true nature in a place where she hoped to maintain a good reputation. Turning to Darcy, she accused him, in jest, of unfairly sharing unflattering stories about her from Hertfordshire, warning that provoking her might lead her to share stories about him that might shock his relatives. Darcy replied, smiling, that he wasn't afraid of her. Colonel Fitzwilliam asked Elizabeth to share what accusations she had against Darcy. Elizabeth warned him to brace himself for something terrible—namely, that at the first event she saw Darcy at in Hertfordshire, he only danced four dances, though there were not many gentlemen and several ladies needed partners. She challenged Darcy not to deny it. Darcy explained that he hadn’t known anyone there outside his own group. Elizabeth sarcastically responded that, of course, no one could ever be introduced at a ball. Turning back to the piano, she asked Fitzwilliam what she should play next. Darcy then admitted that perhaps he should have sought introductions, but he felt himself not good at making a favorable first impression on strangers. Elizabeth suggested they ask Fitzwilliam why someone as sensible and educated as Darcy struggles to introduce himself to new people. Fitzwilliam answered that Darcy simply doesn’t make the effort. Darcy agreed, saying he lacked the talent some have for easy conversation with strangers and couldn't pretend interest, as others did. Elizabeth compared this to her own piano playing—she doesn’t play as well as others because she hasn’t practiced, though she believes her fingers could if she tried. Darcy replied that Elizabeth was right and had spent her time better, complimenting her playing and suggesting that neither of them appeals to strangers."

As she had heard no carriage, she thought it not unlikely to be Lady Catherine; and under that apprehension was putting away her half-finished letter, that she might escape all impertinent questions, when the door opened, and to her very great surprise Mr. Darcy, and Mr. Darcy only, entered the room.\nHe seemed astonished too on finding her alone, and apologized for his intrusion, by letting her know that he had understood all the ladies to be within.\nThey then sat down, and when her inquiries after Rosings were made, seemed in danger of sinking into total silence. It was absolutely necessary, therefore, to think of something; and in this emergency recollecting when she had seen him last in Hertfordshire, and feeling curious to know what he would say on the subject of their hasty departure, she observed,—\n“How very suddenly you all quitted Netherfield last November, Mr. Darcy! It must have been a most agreeable surprise to Mr. Bingley to see you all after him so soon; for, if I recollect right, he went but the day before. He and his sisters were well, I hope, when you left London?”\n“Perfectly so, I thank you.”\nShe found that she was to receive no other answer; and, after a short pause, added,—\n“I think I have understood that Mr. Bingley has not much idea of ever returning to Netherfield again?”\n“I have never heard him say so; but it is probable that he may spend very little of his time there in future. He has many friends, and he is at a time of life when friends and engagements are continually increasing.”\n“If he means to be but little at Netherfield, it would be better for the neighbourhood that he should give up the place entirely, for then we might possibly get a settled family there. But, perhaps, Mr. Bingley did not take the house so much for the convenience of the neighbourhood as for his own, and we must expect him to keep or quit it on the same principle.”\n“I should not be surprised,” said Darcy, “if he were to give it up as soon as any eligible purchase offers.”\nElizabeth made no answer.",

She was taken aback by the sound of a doorbell ringing, which definitely meant a visitor had arrived. Having heard no carriage approach, she suspected it might be Lady Catherine. Fearing intrusive questions, she began tucking away her letter, still unfinished, when the door opened. To her immense surprise, Mr. Darcy entered the room, and he was alone. He seemed equally taken aback to find her unaccompanied and apologized for interrupting, explaining that he had understood all the ladies were at home. They both sat down, and after she inquired about affairs at Rosings, the conversation seemed on the verge of falling into complete silence. Realizing a topic was urgently needed, and recalling their last meeting in Hertfordshire as well as being curious about his perspective on their quick departure, Elizabeth commented, “Mr. Darcy, you and your party left Netherfield quite suddenly last November! It must have been a delightful surprise for Mr. Bingley to see you all follow him so soon, considering, if I remember correctly, he had only left the day before. I hope he and his sisters were well when you left London?” He replied simply, “Perfectly so, thank you.” She understood that this was all the answer she would receive. After a brief pause, she added, “I believe I heard that Mr. Bingley has no real intention of ever returning to Netherfield?” Darcy responded, “I have never heard him express that, but it is likely he will spend very little time there in the future. He has a wide circle of friends, and at his age, friendships and social commitments are constantly increasing.” Elizabeth remarked, “If he plans to be there so seldom, it would benefit the neighbourhood more if he just gave up the property entirely; then we might get a family who would settle there permanently. But perhaps Mr. Bingley didn't rent the house for the neighbourhood's convenience as much as his own, and we should expect him to either keep or leave it based on his personal reasons.” Darcy replied, “I would not be surprised if he decided to give it up as soon as a suitable property to purchase becomes available.” Elizabeth offered no reply.",

To her surprise, it was only Mr. Darcy who entered the room. Darcy, also looking surprised to find Elizabeth alone, apologized for disturbing her, explaining he thought all the ladies were at home. They both sat down, and after Elizabeth asked after Rosings, a silence fell between them. To keep the conversation going, Elizabeth brought up the sudden departure from Netherfield the previous November and asked after Mr. Bingley and his sisters. Darcy replied briefly that they were all well. Elizabeth then mentioned she'd heard Mr. Bingley did not plan to return to Netherfield often, to which Darcy responded that he had not heard Bingley say so, but it was likely he would not spend much time there because he had many friends and increasing social obligations. Elizabeth remarked that if Bingley rarely visited, it might be better for the neighborhood if he gave up the house so another family could settle there, though perhaps Bingley had taken the home for his own convenience. Darcy said he would not be surprised if Bingley gave up the house as soon as a suitable alternative became available. Elizabeth had nothing further to say."

After staying only a few minutes longer without engaging much with anyone, he left. \"What can this possibly mean?\" Charlotte exclaimed the moment he was gone. \"My dear Eliza,\" she added, \"he must surely be in love with you, or he wouldn't have visited us in such an informal way.\"",

The gentleman seemed to have a shift in his mood; he moved his chair back, picked up a newspaper from the table, and, looking over it, asked in a more distant tone, “Do you like Kent?” They had a brief, reserved conversation about the countryside, which ended quickly when Charlotte and her sister came in from their walk. The two women were surprised to find Elizabeth alone with Mr. Darcy. Mr. Darcy explained the misunderstanding that led him to interrupt Miss Bennet, and after a few more minutes of saying little, he left. Once he was gone, Charlotte exclaimed, “What does this mean? Eliza, he must be in love with you, or else he wouldn’t have visited us so informally.”"

All field sports were over. Within doors there was Lady Catherine, books, and a billiard table, but gentlemen cannot be always within doors; and in the nearness of the Parsonage, or the pleasantness of the walk to it, or of the people who lived in it, the two cousins found a temptation from this period of walking thither almost every day. They called at various times of the morning, sometimes separately, sometimes together, and now and then accompanied by their aunt. It was plain to them all that Colonel Fitzwilliam came because he had pleasure in their society, a persuasion which of course recommended him still more; and Elizabeth was reminded by her own satisfaction in being with him, as well as by his evident admiration, of her former favourite, George Wickham; and though, in comparing them, she saw there was less captivating softness in Colonel Fitzwilliam’s manners, she believed he might have the best informed mind.\nBut why Mr. Darcy came so often to the Parsonage it was more difficult to understand. It could not be for society, as he frequently sat there ten minutes together without opening his lips; and when he did speak, it seemed the effect of necessity rather than of choice—a sacrifice to propriety, not a pleasure to himself. He seldom appeared really animated. Mrs. Collins knew not what to make of him. Colonel Fitzwilliam’s occasionally laughing at his stupidity proved that he was generally different, which her own knowledge of him could not have told her; and as she would have liked to believe this change the effect of love, and the object of that love her friend Eliza, she set herself seriously to work to find it out: she watched him whenever they were at Rosings, and whenever he came to Hunsford; but without much success. He certainly looked at her friend a great deal, but the expression of that look was disputable. It was an earnest, steadfast gaze, but she often doubted whether there were much admiration in it, and sometimes it seemed nothing but absence of mind.\nShe had once or twice suggested to Elizabeth the possibility of his being partial to her, but Elizabeth always laughed at the idea; and Mrs. Collins did not think it right to press the subject, from the danger of raising expectations which might only end in disappointment; for in her opinion it admitted not of a doubt, that all her friend’s dislike would vanish, if she could suppose him to be in her power.\nIn her kind schemes for Elizabeth, she sometimes planned her marrying Colonel Fitzwilliam. He was, beyond comparison, the pleasantest man: he certainly admired her, and his situation in life was most eligible; but, to counterbalance these advantages, Mr. Darcy had considerable patronage in the church, and his cousin could have none at all.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "However, when Elizabeth mentioned his quietness, it didn't seem very likely to be the reason for his visit, even according to Charlotte's hopes. After speculating for a while, they could only conclude that his visits were due to a lack of other activities, which was particularly plausible given the time of year. Outdoor pursuits were finished. Inside, there was Lady Catherine, reading, and a billiard table, but gentlemen can't stay indoors all the time. So, the proximity of the Parsonage, the enjoyable walk to it, or the company living there presented a reason for the two cousins to visit almost daily from then on. They stopped by at different times in the morning, sometimes alone, sometimes together, and occasionally with their aunt. It was obvious to everyone that Colonel Fitzwilliam visited because he enjoyed their company, an opinion that naturally made him more appealing. Elizabeth felt satisfied being with him, and combined with his clear admiration, it reminded her of her previous favourite, George Wickham. Although she noted that Colonel Fitzwilliam's manners lacked the charming gentleness of Wickham's, she thought his intellect might be superior.\n\nBut why Mr. Darcy came so often to the Parsonage was harder to understand. His purpose couldn't be for conversation, as he frequently sat for ten minutes without speaking. When he did speak, it seemed forced, a duty to social customs rather than something he wanted to do, offering him no pleasure. He rarely appeared lively. Mrs. Collins was perplexed by his behaviour. Colonel Fitzwilliam sometimes joked about his dullness, confirming that he was usually different, something her own observations couldn't have told her. Since she wished to believe this change was caused by love, and that Elizabeth was the object of it, she seriously began trying to find out. She watched him whenever they were at Rosings and whenever he visited Hunsford, but without much success. He certainly looked at her friend frequently, but the meaning of his look was ambiguous. It was a steady, intense stare, but she often questioned whether it contained much admiration, and sometimes it seemed like mere absent-mindedness.\n\nShe had once or twice suggested to Elizabeth that he might be interested in her, but Elizabeth always dismissed the idea with a laugh. Mrs. Collins felt it was wrong to insist on the topic, fearing she might create expectations that would only lead to disappointment. In her view, she had no doubt that all of her friend's dislike would vanish if she believed he was emotionally invested in her.\n\nIn her benevolent plans for Elizabeth, she sometimes envisioned her marrying Colonel Fitzwilliam. He was, by far, the more pleasant man. He clearly admired her, and his social standing was very suitable. However, offsetting these advantages, Mr. Darcy held significant influence over church appointments, whereas his cousin had none at all.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "Elizabeth recounted that Mr. Darcy barely spoke when he visited, and even Charlotte, who hoped otherwise, found it unlikely that there was any deeper reason for his calls. After mulling over various possibilities, they concluded that his visits likely stemmed from boredom, which was understandable since it was the time of year when outdoor sports were finished. Indoor entertainments—Lady Catherine, books, and billiards—were limited and men could not stay inside all day. The proximity of the Parsonage, the pleasant walk there, or the enjoyable company of its residents offered a welcome diversion, and so the two cousins started to stroll over nearly every day—sometimes alone, sometimes together, and occasionally accompanied by their aunt. It became obvious to everyone that Colonel Fitzwilliam visited because he enjoyed their company, which made him all the more likable. Elizabeth, charmed by his company and his clear affection for her, was reminded of her old favourite, George Wickham, and could not help comparing the two. Although Colonel Fitzwilliam was less captivating in manner than Wickham, she believed he was better educated and more knowledgeable.\n\nHowever, Darcy's frequent visits to the Parsonage were harder to explain. He did not seem to come for the conversation, often sitting in silence for ten minutes at a time; when he did speak, it appeared to be out of social obligation rather than genuine interest. He rarely looked animated. Mrs. Collins was puzzled by his behavior; occasionally, Colonel Fitzwilliam would laugh and call Darcy dull, which suggested to Mrs. Collins that Darcy was not always so quiet—a fact she would not have guessed on her own. Wishing to believe that Darcy's awkwardness was due to love for Elizabeth, Mrs. Collins started watching him closely both at Rosings and the Parsonage, but her observations yielded little. Although Darcy often looked at Elizabeth, the meaning of his gaze was uncertain—it was intent and steady, but sometimes seemed more absent-minded than admiring.\n\nMrs. Collins hinted to Elizabeth that Darcy might be interested in her, but Elizabeth just laughed it off. Mrs. Collins refrained from pushing the suggestion, wary of raising hopes that could lead to disappointment; she felt sure, however, that Elizabeth would soon stop disliking Darcy if she thought she had influence over him.\n\nIn her friendly matchmaking, Mrs. Collins sometimes imagined Elizabeth marrying Colonel Fitzwilliam, whom she found far more agreeable—he clearly admired Elizabeth, and his circumstances were excellent. However, Darcy's connection to church patronage was a considerable advantage that Colonel Fitzwilliam did not possess."

It felt almost intentional on his part, or perhaps a self-imposed duty; because on these occasions, it wasn't just a quick formal greeting and an awkward pause before leaving, but he actually felt obligated to turn around and walk alongside her. He didn't talk much, nor did she make much effort to converse or listen; but during their third unexpected meeting, it struck her that he was asking some strange, unrelated questions—about whether she enjoyed being in Hunsford, her preference for walking alone, and her thoughts on Mr. and Mrs. Collins's happiness; and when discussing Rosings and her unfamiliarity with the house, he appeared to anticipate that if she returned to Kent in the future, she would be staying there too. His words seemed to imply this. Could he have been thinking of Colonel Fitzwilliam?

Putting away the letter immediately, and forcing a smile, she said,—\n“I did not know before that you ever walked this way.”\n“I have been making the tour of the park,” he replied, “as I generally do every year, and intended to close it with a call at the Parsonage. Are you going much farther?”\n“No, I should have turned in a moment.”\nAnd accordingly she did turn, and they walked towards the Parsonage together.\n“Do you certainly leave Kent on Saturday?” said she.\n“Yes—if Darcy does not put it off again. But I am at his disposal. He arranges the business just as he pleases.”\n“And if not able to please himself in the arrangement, he has at least great pleasure in the power of choice. I do not know anybody who seems more to enjoy the power of doing what he likes than Mr. Darcy.”\n“He likes to have his own way very well,” replied Colonel Fitzwilliam. “But so we all do. It is only that he has better means of having it than many others, because he is rich, and many others are poor. I speak feelingly. A younger son, you know, must be inured to self-denial and dependence.”\n“In my opinion, the younger son of an earl can know very little of either. Now, seriously, what have you ever known of self-denial and dependence? When have you been prevented by want of money from going wherever you chose or procuring anything you had a fancy for?”\n“These are home questions—and perhaps I cannot say that I have experienced many hardships of that nature. But in matters of greater weight, I may suffer from the want of money. Younger sons cannot marry where they like.”\n“Unless where they like women of fortune, which I think they very often do.”\n“Our habits of expense make us too dependent, and there are not many in my rank of life who can afford to marry without some attention to money.”\n“Is this,” thought Elizabeth, “meant for me?” and she coloured at the idea; but, recovering herself, said in a lively tone, “And pray, what is the usual price of an earl’s younger son? Unless the elder brother is very sickly, I suppose you would not ask above fifty thousand pounds.”\nHe answered her in the same style, and the subject dropped. To interrupt a silence which might make him fancy her affected with what had passed, she soon afterwards said,—\n“I imagine your cousin brought you down with him chiefly for the sake of having somebody at his disposal. I wonder he does not marry, to secure a lasting convenience of that kind. But, perhaps, his sister does as well for the present; and, as she is under his sole care, he may do what he likes with her.”\n“No,” said Colonel Fitzwilliam, “that is an advantage which he must divide with me. I am joined with him in the guardianship of Miss Darcy.”\n“Are you, indeed? And pray what sort of a guardian do you make? Does your charge give you much trouble? Young ladies of her age are sometimes a little difficult to manage; and if she has the true Darcy spirit, she may like to have her own way.”",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "One day while walking, she was absorbed in rereading Jane's latest letter, reflecting on parts that suggested Jane wasn't in good spirits. Suddenly, instead of encountering Mr. Darcy again, she saw Colonel Fitzwilliam approaching as she looked up. She quickly put the letter away and forced a smile, remarking, \"I wasn't aware you ever walked this way.\" He responded, \"I've been doing my usual annual tour of the park and planned to finish it with a visit to the Parsonage. Are you planning to go much further?\" \"No, I was just about to turn back,\" she replied. And so she did turn, and they walked towards the Parsonage together. She asked, \"Are you definitely leaving Kent on Saturday?\" \"Yes,\" he said, \"unless Darcy postpones it again. But my plans depend entirely on him. He arranges everything as he sees fit.\" Elizabeth commented, \"And if he can't get his own way in arranging things, he certainly seems to enjoy the authority to choose. I don't know anyone who appears to relish the power to do as they please more than Mr. Darcy.\" Colonel Fitzwilliam agreed, \"He does like having his own way very much. But don't we all? The difference is simply that he possesses better means to achieve it than many others, being wealthy while many are not. I speak from experience. A younger son, as you know, must get used to self-denial and reliance on others.\" Elizabeth countered, \"In my opinion, an earl's younger son knows very little of either. Seriously, what have you ever truly experienced of self-denial or dependence? When has a lack of money ever stopped you from going where you wished or getting something you desired?\" \"Those are pointed questions,\" he replied, \"and perhaps I can't claim to have faced many such specific hardships. But in more significant matters, I can suffer from not having money. Younger sons aren't free to marry whomever they like.\" She quipped, \"Unless they happen to like wealthy women, which I suspect is quite often the case.\" He explained, \"Our expensive lifestyles make us too dependent, and few people in my social position can afford to marry without giving some thought to money.\" \"Is that,\" Elizabeth wondered to herself, \"meant for me?\" The thought made her blush, but she quickly regained her composure and said cheerfully, \"And tell me, what is the typical cost of an earl's younger son? Unless the elder brother is quite frail, I assume you wouldn't expect more than fifty thousand pounds.\" He responded in the same lighthearted manner, and the conversation shifted. To prevent him from thinking she was disturbed by their previous topic, she soon said, \"I imagine your cousin primarily brought you here so he would have someone readily available. I'm surprised he hasn't married to secure that kind of permanent convenience. But perhaps his sister serves the purpose well enough for now; since she's solely under his care, he can do as he pleases with her.\" \"No,\" said Colonel Fitzwilliam, \"that's an advantage he has to share with me. I am a joint guardian of Miss Darcy with him.\" \"Are you, really?\" she asked. \"And what kind of guardian are you? Does your ward cause you much trouble? Young ladies her age can sometimes be a bit difficult to manage; and if she has the true Darcy spirit, she might like to have things her own way.\"",

She quickly put away the letter and forced a smile, greeting him by saying she hadn’t realized he ever walked that way. He explained he’d been touring the park, as he usually did each year, and planned to finish by visiting the Parsonage. He asked if she was going further; she said she was just about to turn back, and together they started toward the Parsonage.\n\nElizabeth asked if he was definitely leaving Kent on Saturday. Colonel Fitzwilliam replied that he would, unless Mr. Darcy delayed their departure again, since Darcy made all the arrangements. Elizabeth remarked that, even if Mr. Darcy couldn’t always arrange things exactly as he wanted, he certainly seemed to enjoy having the power to choose for himself more than anyone else she knew. Colonel Fitzwilliam agreed that Darcy liked his own way, but said everyone did—the difference was that Darcy was rich and could get it, while others, like himself, were less fortunate. He admitted, as a younger son, he was accustomed to self-denial and dependence.\n\nElizabeth doubted that the younger son of an earl knew much about self-denial or dependence, teasing him by asking when he had ever lacked money for anything he wanted. Colonel Fitzwilliam conceded he hadn’t struggled much in that respect, but pointed out that in more serious matters—such as marriage—money could be an obstacle for younger sons. Elizabeth joked that is why younger sons often chose wealthy wives. Colonel Fitzwilliam agreed, saying their spending habits made them reliant on marrying for money, as few in his position could afford to marry otherwise.\n\nElizabeth wondered if these comments were aimed at her and blushed at the idea, but recovered, and asked, jokingly, what price an earl’s younger son usually fetched for a marriage settlement—unless his older brother was very ill, she supposed he wouldn’t ask for more than fifty thousand pounds. Colonel Fitzwilliam replied in the same playful tone, and then the conversation moved on.\n\nTo avoid any awkwardness, Elizabeth changed the subject, suggesting that Mr. Darcy had probably brought Colonel Fitzwilliam along mainly to have someone at his disposal, and joked that perhaps Darcy should marry to ensure a permanent companion. She observed that Darcy’s sister, whom he cared for, must currently fulfill that role and he could do as he pleased with her. Colonel Fitzwilliam corrected her, saying he shared guardianship of Miss Darcy with Darcy. Elizabeth asked what kind of guardian he made, whether his ward gave him much trouble, and, noting young women were sometimes difficult, wondered aloud if Miss Darcy, possessing her brother’s determined spirit, liked to have her own way."

She is a very great favourite with some ladies of my acquaintance, Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley. I think I have heard you say that you know them.”\n“I know them a little. Their brother is a pleasant, gentlemanlike man—he is a great friend of Darcy’s.”\n“Oh yes,” said Elizabeth drily—“Mr. Darcy is uncommonly kind to Mr. Bingley, and takes a prodigious deal of care of him.”\n“Care of him! Yes, I really believe Darcy does take care of him in those points where he most wants care. From something that he told me in our journey hither, I have reason to think Bingley very much indebted to him. But I ought to beg his pardon, for I have no right to suppose that Bingley was the person meant. It was all conjecture.”\n“What is it you mean?”\n“It is a circumstance which Darcy of course could not wish to be generally known, because if it were to get round to the lady’s family it would be an unpleasant thing.”\n“You may depend upon my not mentioning it.”\n“And remember that I have not much reason for supposing it to be Bingley. What he told me was merely this: that he congratulated himself on having lately saved a friend from the inconveniences of a most imprudent marriage, but without mentioning names or any other particulars; and I only suspected it to be Bingley from believing him the kind of young man to get into a scrape of that sort, and from knowing them to have been together the whole of last summer.”\n“Did Mr. Darcy give you his reasons for this interference?”\n“I understood that there were some very strong objections against the lady.”\n“And what arts did he use to separate them?”\n“He did not talk to me of his own arts,” said Fitzwilliam, smiling. “He only told me what I have now told you.”\nElizabeth made no answer, and walked on, her heart swelling with indignation. After watching her a little, Fitzwilliam asked her why she was so thoughtful.\n“I am thinking of what you have been telling me,” said she. “Your cousin’s conduct does not suit my feelings. Why was he to be the judge?”\n“You are rather disposed to call his interference officious?”\n“I do not see what right Mr. Darcy had to decide on the propriety of his friend’s inclination; or why, upon his own judgment alone, he was to determine and direct in what manner that friend was to be happy. But,” she continued, recollecting herself, “as we know none of the particulars, it is not fair to condemn him. It is not to be supposed that there was much affection in the case.”\n“That is not an unnatural surmise,” said Fitzwilliam; “but it is lessening the honour of my cousin’s triumph very sadly.”\nThis was spoken jestingly, but it appeared to her so just a picture of Mr. Darcy, that she would not trust herself with an answer; and, therefore, abruptly changing the conversation, talked on indifferent matters till they reached the Parsonage.",

I think I've heard you mention knowing them?\" \"I know them slightly. Their brother is a pleasant, gentlemanly man – he's a close friend of Darcy's.\" \"Oh yes,\" Elizabeth said dryly, \"Mr. Darcy is exceptionally good to Mr. Bingley and takes an awful lot of care of him.\" \"Care of him! Yes, I truly believe Darcy does look out for him in the areas where he needs it most. Based on something he told me on our journey here, I have reason to think Bingley is very much indebted to him. But I should ask his pardon, as I have no right to assume Bingley was the person he meant. It was just speculation.\" \"What exactly do you mean?\" \"It's something Darcy naturally wouldn't want widely known, because if it got back to the lady's family, it would be awkward.\" \"You can rely on me not to mention it.\" \"And remember, I don't have strong grounds for thinking it was Bingley. All he told me was that he was pleased to have recently saved a friend from the difficulties of a highly ill-advised marriage, without naming names or giving any specifics. I only suspected it was Bingley because he seems like the sort of young man who might get into that kind of mess, and because I knew they had spent the entire previous summer together.\" \"Did Mr. Darcy explain his reasons for this intervention?\" \"I understood there were very serious objections against the lady.\" \"And what methods did he use to separate them?\" \"He didn't tell me about his specific methods,\" said Fitzwilliam with a smile. \"He only told me what I've just told you.\" Elizabeth didn't respond and walked on, her heart swelling with anger.

Why was he appointed the judge?\" \"You're rather inclined to call his interference meddling, aren't you?\" \"I don't see what right Mr. Darcy had to decide on the suitability of his friend's affections, or why, based solely on his own opinion, he should determine and direct how that friend should find happiness. But,\" she continued, collecting herself, \"since we don't know all the details, it's not fair to condemn him. We shouldn't assume there was much affection in the relationship anyway.\" \"That's not an unreasonable assumption,\" said Fitzwilliam, \"but it rather diminishes the glory of my cousin's success.\" He said this jokingly, but it seemed to her such an accurate description of Mr. Darcy that she didn't trust herself to reply.

She's well-liked by Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley, whom I believe you know.\" He replied, \"I know them a little. Their brother is a friendly and respectable man—he's a close friend of Darcy's.\" Elizabeth replied dryly, \"Mr. Darcy is remarkably attentive to Mr. Bingley, making sure to look after him.\" He answered, \"Indeed, I actually think Darcy does look after Bingley, especially where Bingley is most in need of guidance. Based on what Darcy told me during our journey here, I believe Bingley owes him a lot. But I must apologize; I shouldn't assume Bingley was who Darcy meant. It was just speculation.\" Elizabeth asked what he meant. Fitzwilliam explained, \"Darcy wouldn't want this to be publicly known because it would be awkward for the lady's family if it spread.\" Elizabeth assured him, \"You can trust me not to mention it.\" Fitzwilliam cautioned her again, \"Remember, I don't have strong evidence it's Bingley.

I suspected it was Bingley because he seems the type to fall into such trouble, and since they spent last summer together.\" Elizabeth then asked if Darcy explained his reasons for interfering. Fitzwilliam answered that there were strong objections to the lady. She asked what methods Darcy used to break them up, and Fitzwilliam, smiling, said Darcy didn't speak of that, only what he had just told Elizabeth. Elizabeth said nothing, feeling growing anger inside. Fitzwilliam, noticing her silence, asked why she was so thoughtful. She said she was thinking about what he told her, and that Darcy's actions seemed wrong to her; why should Darcy have the right to judge? Fitzwilliam asked if she thought Darcy's interference was meddlesome. Elizabeth said she didn't see why Darcy should decide what was best for his friend, or why his own judgment should dictate his friend's happiness. But, she admitted, since they didn't know the specifics, it wasn't fair to judge him. She added there probably wasn't much love involved. Fitzwilliam replied that this wasn't an unreasonable assumption, but it didn't make Darcy's success look very admirable.

It was not to be supposed that any other people could be meant than those with whom she was connected. There could not exist in the world two men over whom Mr. Darcy could have such boundless influence. That he had been concerned in the measures taken to separate Mr. Bingley and Jane, she had never doubted; but she had always attributed to Miss Bingley the principal design and arrangement of them. If his own vanity, however, did not mislead him, he was the cause—his pride and caprice were the cause—of all that Jane had suffered, and still continued to suffer. He had ruined for a while every hope of happiness for the most affectionate, generous heart in the world; and no one could say how lasting an evil he might have inflicted.\n“There were some very strong objections against the lady,” were Colonel Fitzwilliam’s words; and these strong objections probably were, her having one uncle who was a country attorney, and another who was in business in London.\n“To Jane herself,” she exclaimed, “there could be no possibility of objection,—all loveliness and goodness as she is! Her understanding excellent, her mind improved, and her manners captivating. Neither could anything be urged against my father, who, though with some peculiarities, has abilities which Mr. Darcy himself need not disdain, and respectability which he will probably never reach.” When she thought of her mother, indeed, her confidence gave way a little; but she would not allow that any objections there had material weight with Mr. Darcy, whose pride, she was convinced, would receive a deeper wound from the want of importance in his friend’s connections than from their want of sense; and she was quite decided, at last, that he had been partly governed by this worst kind of pride, and partly by the wish of retaining Mr. Bingley for his sister.\nThe agitation and tears which the subject occasioned brought on a headache; and it grew so much worse towards the evening that, added to her unwillingness to see Mr. Darcy, it determined her not to attend her cousins to Rosings, where they were engaged to drink tea.",

It was obvious that the individuals referred to could only be those connected to her; it was inconceivable that Mr. Darcy could wield such immense influence over any other two men. While she had never doubted his involvement in the efforts to separate Mr. Bingley and Jane, she had always believed Miss Bingley was primarily responsible for planning and executing them. However, if his own conceit hadn't deluded him, he—his arrogance and unpredictability—was the actual cause of all Jane's past and present suffering. He had, for a time, crushed every hope of happiness for the most affectionate and generous heart in the world, and there was no telling how enduring the negative consequences he had created might be. Colonel Fitzwilliam had spoken of \"very serious objections against the lady,\" which likely meant her having one uncle who was a provincial lawyer and another engaged in business in London. She declared vehemently that Jane herself was beyond any objection, being utterly lovely and virtuous, possessing an excellent understanding, a refined mind, and captivating manners. Furthermore, nothing could be held against her father, who, despite some eccentricities, had abilities Mr. Darcy himself ought to respect and a degree of respectability he probably wouldn't achieve. When she considered her mother, her confidence admittedly faltered slightly, but she wouldn't concede that any issues there held significant weight for Mr. Darcy. She was convinced his pride would be wounded more deeply by the lack of social importance in his friend's connections than by any lack of intellect. Ultimately, she was quite certain his actions were motivated partly by this worse form of pride and partly by his wish to secure Mr. Bingley for his sister. The distress and tears these thoughts provoked brought on a headache, which grew so much worse by evening that, coupled with her reluctance to see Mr. Darcy, it led her to decide against joining her cousins at Rosings, where they were scheduled to have tea.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "Once alone in her room after their visitor had gone, she was finally able to reflect undisturbed on all she’d just learned. It was clear to her that no one but those close to her could have been meant by the conversation. There surely were not two men in the world over whom Mr. Darcy exerted such influence. She had always believed he was involved in creating distance between Mr. Bingley and Jane, but she had previously supposed that Miss Bingley was primarily responsible. Now, if Mr. Darcy’s account was accurate and not affected by his vanity, he alone—his pride and whims—had caused all Jane’s pain and still continued to do so. He had, at least temporarily, destroyed the hopes of happiness for someone with the kindest and most generous nature, and it was impossible to say how lasting the harm might be. Colonel Fitzwilliam had remarked that there were significant objections to the lady, and Elizabeth realized these likely referred to Jane’s uncles—one a country lawyer, the other in business in London. “But with Jane herself,” she thought, “how could anyone find fault? She is full of goodness and beauty, intelligent, well-educated, and charming. Nor could my father be justly criticized; despite some quirks, his intellect is considerable—enough to earn Mr. Darcy’s respect, and a level of respectability Mr. Darcy may never reach.” When it came to her mother, Elizabeth’s certainty wavered a little, but she dismissed the idea that any concerns there would matter much to Mr. Darcy. She was convinced his pride would be more offended by her family’s lack of status than by their lack of sense, and she concluded he had been motivated both by this sort of pride and by a desire to keep Mr. Bingley for his own sister. The stress and tears she experienced while thinking about these matters gave her a headache, which grew worse as the evening went on. Combined with her reluctance to see Mr. Darcy again, it led her to decide not to join her cousins at Rosings for tea as they had planned."

But in all, and in almost every line of each, there was a want of that cheerfulness which had been used to characterize her style, and which, proceeding from the serenity of a mind at ease with itself, and kindly disposed towards everyone, had been scarcely ever clouded. Elizabeth noticed every sentence conveying the idea of uneasiness, with an attention which it had hardly received on the first perusal. Mr. Darcy’s shameful boast of what misery he had been able to inflict gave her a keener sense of her sister’s sufferings.

The knowledge of Darcy’s arrogant claim about the unhappiness he had caused made Elizabeth more sensitive to her sister’s suffering.

However, this idea quickly left her mind and her feelings changed entirely when, to her complete shock, she saw Mr. Darcy enter the room. He quickly asked how she was, explaining that he had come only to hear if she was feeling better. Elizabeth responded to him with polite coldness. He sat briefly before standing up and pacing the room. Without saying anything, Elizabeth watched him in surprise. After several minutes of silence, he approached her, clearly unsettled, and began to speak: 'I have tried unsuccessfully to fight my feelings. I cannot do it. I must let you know how deeply I admire and love you.'"

He articulated himself well, but he didn't just speak of affection; he also detailed his feelings concerning his social standing.

He dwelled intensely on his perception of her inferiority, viewing marriage to her as a degradation, and the obstacles presented by her family which his good judgment had always placed in opposition to his attraction. This detailed focus seemed to acknowledge the significance of the person he was offending, but it was certainly not calculated to make his proposal appealing. Despite her deep-seated antipathy towards him, she couldn't entirely dismiss the compliment of receiving affection from such a man. Although her resolve remained unshaken, she initially felt a moment of pity for the hurt he was about to experience. However, his subsequent words, which were full of pride, ignited her resentment, and her compassion turned entirely to anger. Nevertheless, she attempted to compose herself so she could reply calmly once he had finished. He ended by explaining the strength of his attachment, which he claimed he had found impossible to overcome despite all his efforts, and expressed his hope that she would now accept his offer of marriage as a reward.

Nothing can excuse the unfair and heartless way you acted.

You have robbed him of the financial independence during the best years of his life that he was both entitled to and deserved. You are responsible for all of this!

But perhaps,” he added, pausing his walk and facing her, “these wrongdoings might have been overlooked if your pride hadn't been wounded by my honest admission of the reservations that had long prevented me from seriously considering proposing. These bitter accusations might have been avoided if I had been more cunning, concealed my internal struggles, and manipulated you into believing I was solely driven by pure, unqualified affection; by logic, by careful thought, by every possible positive motive. But I detest any form of deception. Nor am I ashamed of the feelings I expressed. They were natural and justifiable. Could you genuinely expect me to be pleased by your family's lower status?—to be happy about the prospect of having relatives whose position in society is so clearly inferior to my own?” Elizabeth felt her anger intensifying by the second, yet she made a great effort to speak calmly as she replied, “You are mistaken, Mr. Darcy, if you believe that the *way* you proposed affected me in any way other than sparing me the difficulty I might have felt in rejecting you, had you proposed in a more gentlemanly manner.” She saw him flinch at this, but he remained silent, and she continued, “You could not have offered me your hand in any way imaginable that would have convinced me to accept it.” Again, his surprise was evident, and he looked at her with an expression mixed with disbelief and wounded pride.

The tumult of her mind was now painfully great. She knew not how to support herself, and, from actual weakness, sat down and cried for half an hour.

That she should receive an offer of marriage from Mr. Darcy! that he should have been in love with her for so many months! so much in love as to wish to marry her in spite of all the objections which had made him prevent his friend’s marrying her sister, and which must appear at least with equal force in his own case, was almost incredible! it was gratifying to have inspired unconsciously so strong an affection. But his pride, his abominable pride, his shameless avowal of what he had done with respect to Jane, his unpardonable assurance in acknowledging, though he could not justify it, and the unfeeling manner which he had mentioned Mr. Wickham, his cruelty towards whom he had not attempted to deny, soon overcame the pity which the consideration of his attachment had for a moment excited.\nShe continued in very agitating reflections till the sound of Lady Catherine’s carriage made her feel how unequal she was to encounter Charlotte’s observation, and hurried her away to her room.",

The turmoil in her mind became incredibly distressing. She felt she could not compose herself and, from pure exhaustion, sat down and cried for thirty minutes. Her amazement, as she reflected on what had occurred, intensified with every thought. That Mr. Darcy would propose to her! That he had been in love with her for months! So deeply in love that he wanted to marry her despite all the objections that had caused him to prevent his friend from marrying her sister—objections that were clearly just as significant in his own situation—was almost impossible to believe! It was satisfying to know she had unknowingly inspired such strong affection. But his arrogance, his detestable pride, his unashamed admission of his actions regarding Jane, his unpardonable presumption in acknowledging it even though he couldn't justify it, and the callous way he had spoken of Mr. Wickham, whose cruel treatment he had not attempted to deny, quickly overcame the sympathy that the thought of his affection had briefly stirred.

Elizabeth's mind was thrown into turmoil. She was so overwhelmed that she had to sit down and cry for half an hour. The more she thought about what had happened, the more astonished she became. To think she had received a marriage proposal from Mr. Darcy! That he had been in love with her for so long! So deeply in love that he wanted to marry her despite all the reasons he had used to stop his friend from marrying her sister, reasons that should apply just as much to himself—it was almost unbelievable. She felt pleased, almost flattered, to have inspired such strong feelings without even realizing it. But soon, thoughts of his pride—his intolerable pride—his unapologetic admission of what he had done to Jane, and the way he spoke about Mr. Wickham, admitting his cruelty without shame or defense, overpowered the brief sympathy she felt because of his affection. She remained lost in these distressing thoughts until the sound of Lady Catherine’s carriage reminded her that she was in no state to face Charlotte, and she quickly retreated to her own room."

          "text_segment": "“Two offences of a very different nature, and by no means of equal magnitude, you last night laid to my charge. The first mentioned was, that, regardless of the sentiments of either, I had detached Mr. Bingley from your sister,—and the other, that I had, in defiance of various claims, in defiance of honour and humanity, ruined the immediate prosperity and blasted the prospects of Mr. Wickham. Wilfully and wantonly to have thrown off the companion of my youth, the acknowledged favourite of my father, a young man who had scarcely any other dependence than on our patronage, and who had been brought up to expect its exertion, would be a depravity, to which the separation of two young persons whose affection could be the growth of only a few weeks, could bear no comparison. But from the severity of that blame which was last night so liberally bestowed, respecting each circumstance, I shall hope to be in future secured, when the following account of my actions and their motives has been read. If, in the explanation of them which is due to myself, I am under the necessity of relating feelings which may be offensive to yours, I can only say that I am sorry. The necessity must be obeyed, and further apology would be absurd. I had not been long in Hertfordshire before I saw, in common with others, that Bingley preferred your elder sister to any other young woman in the country. But it was not till the evening of the dance at Netherfield that I had any apprehension of his feeling a serious attachment. I had often seen him in love before. At that ball, while I had the honour of dancing with you, I was first made acquainted, by Sir William Lucas’s accidental information, that Bingley’s attentions to your sister had given rise to a general expectation of their marriage. He spoke of it as a certain event, of which the time alone could be undecided. From that moment I observed my friend’s behaviour attentively; and I could then perceive that his partiality for Miss Bennet was beyond what I had ever witnessed in him. Your sister I also watched. Her look and manners were open, cheerful, and engaging as ever, but without any symptom of peculiar regard; and I remained convinced, from the evening’s scrutiny, that though she received his attentions with pleasure, she did not invite them by any participation of sentiment. If you have not been mistaken here, I must have been in an error. Your superior knowledge of your sister must make the latter probable. If it be so, if I have been misled by such error to inflict pain on her, your resentment has not been unreasonable. But I shall not scruple to assert, that the serenity of your sister’s countenance and air was such as might have given the most acute observer a conviction that, however amiable her temper, her heart was not likely to be easily touched. That I was desirous of believing her indifferent is certain; but I will venture to say that my investigations and decisions are not usually influenced by my hopes or fears. I did not believe her to be indifferent because I wished it; I believed it on impartial conviction, as truly as I wished it in reason. My objections to the marriage were not merely those which I last night acknowledged to have required the utmost force of passion to put aside in my own case; the want of connection could not be so great an evil to my friend as to me. But there were other causes of repugnance; causes which, though still existing, and existing to an equal degree in both instances, I had myself endeavoured to forget, because they were not immediately before me. These causes must be stated, though briefly. The situation of your mother’s family, though objectionable, was nothing in comparison of that total want of propriety so frequently, so almost uniformly betrayed by herself, by your three younger sisters, and occasionally even by your father:—pardon me,—it pains me to offend you. But amidst your concern for the defects of your nearest relations, and your displeasure at this representation of them, let it give you consolation to consider that to have conducted yourselves so as to avoid any share of the like censure is praise no less generally bestowed on you and your eldest sister than it is honourable to the sense and disposition of both. I will only say, farther, that from what passed that evening my opinion of all parties was confirmed, and every inducement heightened, which could have led me before to preserve my friend from what I esteemed a most unhappy connection. He left Netherfield for London on the day following, as you, I am certain, remember, with the design of soon returning. The part which I acted is now to be explained. His sisters’ uneasiness had been equally excited with my own: our coincidence of feeling was soon discovered; and, alike sensible that no time was to be lost in detaching their brother, we shortly resolved on joining him directly in London. We accordingly went—and there I readily engaged in the office of pointing out to my friend the certain evils of such a choice. I described and enforced them earnestly. But however this remonstrance might have staggered or delayed his determination, I do not suppose that it would ultimately have prevented the marriage, had it not been seconded by the assurance, which I hesitated not in giving, of your sister’s indifference. He had before believed her to return his affection with sincere, if not with equal, regard. But Bingley has great natural modesty, with a stronger dependence on my judgment than on his own. To convince him, therefore, that he had deceived himself was no very difficult point. To persuade him against returning into Hertfordshire, when that conviction had been given, was scarcely the work of a moment. I cannot blame myself for having done thus much. There is but one part of my conduct, in the whole affair, on which I do not reflect with satisfaction; it is that I condescended to adopt the measures of art so far as to conceal from him your sister’s being in town. I knew it myself, as it was known to Miss Bingley; but her brother is even yet ignorant of it. That they might have met without ill consequence is, perhaps, probable; but his regard did not appear to me enough extinguished for him to see her without some danger. Perhaps this concealment, this disguise, was beneath me. It is done, however, and it was done for the best. On this subject I have nothing more to say, no other apology to offer. If I have wounded your sister’s feelings, it was unknowingly done; and though the motives which governed me may to you very naturally appear insufficient, I have not yet learnt to condemn them.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "Last night, you accused me of two different wrongs, unequal in their seriousness. The first was that I intentionally kept Mr. Bingley from your sister, without regard for either of your feelings. The second was that, in defiance of justice, honour, and human kindness, I had destroyed Mr. Wickham's immediate well-being and ruined his future prospects. Deliberately casting aside the companion of my youth, a young man my father favoured, who depended almost entirely on our support and expected it, would be a level of wickedness far worse than merely separating two young people whose attachment could only have been recent. However, I hope to avoid the severe criticism you so freely gave last night regarding both matters once you have read the following explanation of my actions and motives. If, in explaining myself as I must, I have to express feelings that might offend you, I can only say I regret it. This explanation is necessary, and further apologies would be pointless. Soon after arriving in Hertfordshire, like others, I noticed Bingley preferred your elder sister over any other young woman there. But it wasn't until the evening of the Netherfield ball that I feared his feelings were serious. I had seen him fall in love many times before. At that ball, while dancing with you, I first learned, through Sir William Lucas's casual remark, that Bingley's attention to your sister had led everyone to expect their marriage. He spoke of it as a certainty, with only the date unknown. From that moment, I watched my friend's behaviour closely and saw that his fondness for Miss Bennet was stronger than I had ever seen in him. I also observed your sister. Her look and manner were as open, cheerful, and pleasant as always, but without any sign of special affection for him. My observations that evening convinced me that although she accepted his attention with pleasure, she did not encourage it with shared feelings. If you are right about this, I must have been mistaken. Your superior knowledge of your sister makes it likely I was wrong. If that is the case, and if my mistake caused her pain, your anger was not unreasonable. However, I confidently assert that your sister's calm appearance and manner were such that even the most astute observer might conclude that, despite her amiable nature, her heart was not easily moved. It is true I wanted to believe she was indifferent, but I maintain that my judgments are not usually swayed by my hopes or fears. I didn't believe her indifferent simply because I wished it; I believed it based on unbiased observation, as truly as I wished it for logical reasons. My objections to the marriage were not just the ones I mentioned last night, which I admitted took great passion to overcome in my own circumstances; a lack of connections was not as serious a problem for my friend as it was for me. But there were other reasons for my dislike, reasons which, though still present and equally significant in both situations, I had tried to ignore because they weren't immediately visible. These reasons must be mentioned, even if briefly. The background of your mother's family, though objectionable, was minor compared to the complete lack of proper behaviour so frequently, almost constantly, shown by herself, your three younger sisters, and sometimes even your father – please forgive me, it pains me to offend you. But amidst your distress about your family's flaws and your displeasure at my pointing them out, find comfort in knowing that the way you and your eldest sister have conducted yourselves, avoiding any such criticism, is widely praised and speaks highly of your sense and character. Furthermore, I will only add that what happened that evening confirmed my opinion of everyone involved and strengthened every reason I had to protect my friend from what I considered a most unhappy marriage. He left Netherfield for London the next day, as I'm sure you remember, intending to return soon. Now, I will explain my role. His sisters were as uneasy as I was; we quickly discovered our shared feelings and, realizing no time should be wasted in separating their brother, we soon decided to join him directly in London. We went accordingly, and there I willingly took on the task of pointing out to my friend the definite disadvantages of such a choice. I described and emphasized them strongly. But however much this warning may have shaken or delayed his decision, I don't believe it would have ultimately prevented the marriage if it hadn't been supported by the assurance, which I gave without hesitation, that your sister was indifferent. He had previously believed she returned his affection with sincere, if not equal, feeling. But Bingley possesses great natural modesty and relies more on my judgment than his own. Therefore, convincing him that he had been mistaken was not very difficult. Persuading him against returning to Hertfordshire, once he was convinced, took scarcely any time at all. I cannot blame myself for having done this much. There is only one part of my conduct in the entire affair that I don't view with satisfaction: that I lowered myself to use deception by concealing from him that your sister was in town. I knew it, as did Miss Bingley, but her brother is still unaware. Perhaps they might have met without bad consequences, but his feelings did not seem to me extinguished enough for him to see her without some risk. Perhaps this concealment, this deception, was beneath me. However, it was done, and it was done for the best. On this matter, I have nothing further to say, no other apology to offer. If I have hurt your sister's feelings, it was done unknowingly; and although the reasons that guided me may seem quite insufficient to you, I have not yet learned to condemn them.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "Last night, you accused me of two very different wrongdoings that are not equally serious. The first was that I separated Mr. Bingley from your sister without caring about their feelings; the second was that I deliberately harmed Mr. Wickham’s future, ignoring all moral claims on my honor and kindness. To betray someone who was a childhood friend, my father’s favorite, and largely dependent on our support would be a far worse wrong than ending a romance that had only just begun between your sister and Mr. Bingley. Nevertheless, I hope my following explanation will protect me from further criticism regarding both issues. If, as I defend myself, I say anything that pains you, I apologize, but it is necessary and it would be foolish to say more.\n\nSoon after arriving in Hertfordshire, I noticed, as many others did, that Bingley preferred your oldest sister to any other woman. Not until the Netherfield ball, however, did I realize he might be seriously in love. I had seen him infatuated with others before. At that ball, during our own dance, Sir William Lucas casually mentioned that people expected your sister to marry Bingley. He spoke as if it was a certainty. From then, I watched Bingley closely and saw that he indeed cared for your sister in a way I had not observed before. I also observed your sister, whose cheerful and friendly manners showed no sign of special affection; I concluded that while she enjoyed Bingley’s company, she didn’t return his interest. If I judged this wrong, and you know your sister better, then my actions may have hurt her, and your anger is justified. However, I assert that anyone, no matter how discerning, would have viewed your sister as unlikely to fall in love easily, however pleasant her character. I did hope she felt indifferent, but my judgment was based on what I truly observed, not on what I wished.\n\nMy objections to their match were more than those I admitted about my own situation. The lack of proper family connections was not as serious for Bingley as it would be for myself. There were other things that made me uneasy, which I tried to put aside for myself, but still apply here. These include not just your mother's side of the family, but frequent displays of improper behavior by your mother, your three younger sisters, and even, at times, your father. I am sorry to cause you pain by saying this. Take comfort, though, that you and your eldest sister have always conducted yourselves in a way that has earned general praise, which honors you both. From what happened at the ball, my negative opinion of the situation was confirmed and my reasons for discouraging Bingley from the match increased. He left for London the following day—as you surely recall—planning to return soon. Here’s what I did: Bingley’s sisters shared my concerns. We quickly decided to follow him to London, and once there, I took it upon myself to strongly warn him about the risks of marrying your sister. While my arguments might not have changed his mind by themselves, I told him without hesitation that your sister didn’t care for him, which convinced him. Bingley is modest and relies on my advice, so it was not hard to persuade him not to return to Hertfordshire. I don't regret what I did here, except for one thing: I kept Bingley from knowing your sister was in London at the same time. Although it might not have mattered if they had met, I felt it was safer to prevent it in case his feelings weren’t resolved. Concealing this fact may have been beneath me, but I thought it for the best. If my actions hurt your sister’s feelings, I did it without knowing. My reasons may seem insufficient to you, but I do not regret them."

          "text_segment": "—With respect to that other, more weighty accusation, of having injured Mr. Wickham, I can only refute it by laying before you the whole of his connection with my family. Of what he has particularly accused me I am ignorant; but of the truth of what I shall relate I can summon more than one witness of undoubted veracity. Mr. Wickham is the son of a very respectable man, who had for many years the management of all the Pemberley estates, and whose good conduct in the discharge of his trust naturally inclined my father to be of service to him; and on George Wickham, who was his godson, his kindness was therefore liberally bestowed. My father supported him at school, and afterwards at Cambridge; most important assistance, as his own father, always poor from the extravagance of his wife, would have been unable to give him a gentleman’s education. My father was not only fond of this young man’s society, whose manners were always engaging, he had also the highest opinion of him, and hoping the church would be his profession, intended to provide for him in it. As for myself, it is many, many years since I first began to think of him in a very different manner. The vicious propensities, the want of principle, which he was careful to guard from the knowledge of his best friend, could not escape the observation of a young man of nearly the same age with himself, and who had opportunities of seeing him in unguarded moments, which Mr. Darcy could not have. Here again I shall give you pain—to what degree you only can tell. But whatever may be the sentiments which Mr. Wickham has created, a suspicion of their nature shall not prevent me from unfolding his real character. It adds even another motive. My excellent father died about five years ago; and his attachment to Mr. Wickham was to the last so steady, that in his will he particularly recommended it to me to promote his advancement in the best manner that his profession might allow, and if he took orders, desired that a valuable family living might be his as soon as it became vacant. There was also a legacy of one thousand pounds. His own father did not long survive mine; and within half a year from these events Mr. Wickham wrote to inform me that, having finally resolved against taking orders, he hoped I should not think it unreasonable for him to expect some more immediate pecuniary advantage, in lieu of the preferment, by which he could not be benefited. He had some intention, he added, of studying the law, and I must be aware that the interest of one thousand pounds would be a very insufficient support therein. I rather wished than believed him to be sincere; but, at any rate, was perfectly ready to accede to his proposal. I knew that Mr. Wickham ought not to be a clergyman. The business was therefore soon settled. He resigned all claim to assistance in the church, were it possible that he could ever be in a situation to receive it, and accepted in return three thousand pounds. All connection between us seemed now dissolved. I thought too ill of him to invite him to Pemberley, or admit his society in town. In town, I believe, he chiefly lived, but his studying the law was a mere pretence; and being now free from all restraint, his life was a life of idleness and dissipation. For about three years I heard little of him; but on the decease of the incumbent of the living which had been designed for him, he applied to me again by letter for the presentation. His circumstances, he assured me, and I had no difficulty in believing it, were exceedingly bad. He had found the law a most unprofitable study, and was now absolutely resolved on being ordained, if I would present him to the living in question—of which he trusted there could be little doubt, as he was well assured that I had no other person to provide for, and I could not have forgotten my revered father’s intentions. You will hardly blame me for refusing to comply with this entreaty, or for resisting every repetition of it. His resentment was in proportion to the distress of his circumstances—and he was doubtless as violent in his abuse of me to others as in his reproaches to myself. After this period, every appearance of acquaintance was dropped. How he lived, I know not. But last summer he was again most painfully obtruded on my notice. I must now mention a circumstance which I would wish to forget myself, and which no obligation less than the present should induce me to unfold to any human being. Having said thus much, I feel no doubt of your secrecy. My sister, who is more than ten years my junior, was left to the guardianship of my mother’s nephew, Colonel Fitzwilliam, and myself. About a year ago, she was taken from school, and an establishment formed for her in London; and last summer she went with the lady who presided over it to Ramsgate; and thither also went Mr. Wickham, undoubtedly by design; for there proved to have been a prior acquaintance between him and Mrs. Younge, in whose character we were most unhappily deceived; and by her connivance and aid he so far recommended himself to Georgiana, whose affectionate heart retained a strong impression of his kindness to her as a child, that she was persuaded to believe herself in love and to consent to an elopement. She was then but fifteen, which must be her excuse; and after stating her imprudence, I am happy to add, that I owed the knowledge of it to herself. I joined them unexpectedly a day or two before the intended elopement; and then Georgiana, unable to support the idea of grieving and offending a brother whom she almost looked up to as a father, acknowledged the whole to me. You may imagine what I felt and how I acted. Regard for my sister’s credit and feelings prevented any public exposure; but I wrote to Mr. Wickham, who left the place immediately, and Mrs. Younge was of course removed from her charge. Mr. Wickham’s chief object was unquestionably my sister’s fortune, which is thirty thousand pounds; but I cannot help supposing that the hope of revenging himself on me was a strong inducement.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "Regarding the more serious accusation, that I harmed Mr. Wickham, I can only disprove it by presenting the complete history of his relationship with my family. I don't know exactly what specific charges he has made against me, but I can provide more than one trustworthy witness to confirm the truth of what I am about to tell you. Mr. Wickham is the son of a very reputable man who managed all of the Pemberley estates for many years. His excellent service naturally led my father to want to help him. Consequently, my father was very generous to George Wickham, who was his godson. My father paid for his education at school and later at Cambridge, which was crucial assistance since Wickham's own father, always poor due to his wife's extravagance, couldn't have afforded a gentleman's education for him. My father not only enjoyed this young man's company, as his manners were always pleasant, but he also had the highest regard for him and intended to provide for him by encouraging him to enter the clergy. As for myself, I began to view him very differently many years ago. His bad habits and lack of morals, which he carefully hid from his closest friends, could not escape the notice of someone close to his own age who had the chance to observe him in unguarded moments, something Mr. Darcy Sr. did not have. Telling you this will again cause you pain, how much, only you can say. But no matter what feelings Mr. Wickham has stirred up, a suspicion about his true character will not stop me from revealing it. It even gives me another reason to do so. My excellent father passed away about five years ago. His affection for Mr. Wickham remained so constant until the end that in his will, he specifically instructed me to help Wickham advance in his chosen profession as much as possible, and if he became ordained, my father wanted a valuable family church position to be given to him as soon as it became available. There was also a legacy of one thousand pounds. Wickham's own father died not long after mine. Within six months of these events, Mr. Wickham wrote to inform me that he had decided against ordination and hoped I wouldn't find it unreasonable for him to request some more immediate financial benefit instead of the church position he would not be taking. He added that he had some intention of studying law and that I must realize the interest from one thousand pounds would be insufficient support for that. I hoped rather than believed he was sincere, but in any case, I was perfectly willing to agree to his request. I knew Mr. Wickham was not suited to be a clergyman. The matter was therefore quickly settled. He gave up all claim to assistance related to the church, even if he could ever have been in a position to receive it, and accepted three thousand pounds in return. All connection between us seemed now broken. I had such a low opinion of him that I neither invited him to Pemberley nor socialized with him in town. I believe he lived mostly in town, but his claim of studying law was a mere pretense. Now free from restraint, he lived a life of idleness and wild spending. For about three years I heard little of him, but upon the death of the clergyman who held the position intended for him, he wrote to me again asking for the appointment. He assured me his financial situation was extremely bad, which I had no trouble believing. He said he had found studying law very unprofitable and was now absolutely determined to become ordained if I would present him to the living in question. He was confident I would do this, as he was certain I had no one else to provide for and could not have forgotten my revered father’s wishes. You can hardly blame me for refusing his plea or for rejecting his repeated requests. His anger matched the desperation of his circumstances, and he was undoubtedly as harsh in his criticism of me to others as he was in his complaints directly to me. After this period, we completely dropped any pretense of acquaintance. How he lived, I do not know. But last summer, he was once again most unpleasantly forced upon my attention. I must now mention something I wish I could forget myself, and which only the current necessity would compel me to reveal to anyone. Having said this much, I am confident you will keep it secret. My sister, who is more than ten years younger than me, was placed under the guardianship of my mother’s nephew, Colonel Fitzwilliam, and myself. About a year ago, she left school, and a household was set up for her in London. Last summer, she went with the lady in charge of her to Ramsgate, and Mr. Wickham also went there, undoubtedly on purpose. It turned out he had a previous acquaintance with Mrs. Younge, the lady overseeing Georgiana, in whose character we were most unfortunately mistaken. Through Mrs. Younge’s complicity and help, Wickham managed to so impress Georgiana, whose affectionate heart still held a strong positive memory of his kindness to her as a child, that she became convinced she was in love and agreed to elope. She was only fifteen then, which must serve as her excuse. After stating her imprudence, I am happy to add that I learned about it from her herself. I arrived unexpectedly a day or two before the planned elopement. Then Georgiana, unable to bear the thought of disappointing and hurting a brother whom she almost saw as a father figure, confessed everything to me. You can imagine what I felt and how I acted. Concern for my sister’s reputation and feelings prevented any public exposure, but I wrote to Mr. Wickham, who immediately left the place, and Mrs. Younge was of course removed from her position. Mr. Wickham’s main goal was undoubtedly my sister’s fortune, which is thirty thousand pounds, but I cannot help but suspect that the hope of getting revenge on me was also a significant motivation.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "In response to the serious charge of having wronged Mr. Wickham, I can only clear my name by sharing the entire history of his relationship with my family. While I do not know the specific claims he has made against me, I can present multiple trustworthy witnesses to validate what I am about to say. Mr. Wickham is the son of a highly regarded man who managed all the Pemberley estates for many years. Because of his loyal service, my father felt compelled to help him, especially his godson, George Wickham. My father paid for Wickham’s education at school and later at Cambridge, providing support that his own financially struggling family could not. My father valued Wickham’s company and had hoped to see him enter the church, intending to secure him a good position. However, over the years, I came to see Wickham differently. Despite his charm with adults, I noticed flaws in his character that others did not see. I feel compelled, in light of recent events, to reveal his true character. When my father passed away about five years ago, he was still attached to Wickham and asked in his will that I help him find a career in the church, promising him a valuable church position when it became available, as well as a legacy of one thousand pounds. Wickham’s own father died soon after, and within six months Wickham wrote to me explaining that he did not want to join the church after all. He requested a financial settlement instead, claiming he wanted to study law, and said that the one thousand pounds would not be enough. While I doubted his sincerity, I agreed to his proposal, knowing he was unsuited to be a clergyman. He gave up any claim to a church position, and I gave him three thousand pounds. Our relationship ended there, and I did not invite him to Pemberley again. He mostly lived in town and, rather than studying law, led an idle and reckless life. For about three years, I heard little from him. Then, when the church position my father had promised became vacant, Wickham wrote to ask for it, now claiming law had not worked for him and that he was determined to become a clergyman. He reminded me that my father wished for him to have it, and argued I had no one else to provide for. I refused his request, despite his repeated appeals. He responded with anger and likely spoke poorly of me to others. After this, we ceased all association. I do not know how he lived after that, but last summer he became involved in my life again in an extremely unpleasant way. I must share an unfortunate event I’d rather forget, but I trust you with this information. My younger sister Georgiana, left in my care and that of our cousin Colonel Fitzwilliam, was taken from school about a year ago and set up in London. Last summer she visited Ramsgate with her companion, Mrs. Younge. Wickham also went there, clearly on purpose, as he already knew Mrs. Younge, whom we mistakenly trusted. With her help, Wickham gained my sister’s affection so much that she agreed to elope with him. She was only fifteen at the time and realized the mistake herself, confessing it to me just before they could leave. Out of concern for my sister’s reputation, I handled the matter discreetly; I wrote to Wickham, who left immediately, and removed Mrs. Younge from her position. Wickham’s main motivation was clearly my sister’s large fortune of thirty thousand pounds, though I suspect he also wanted revenge on me."

With a strong prejudice against everything he might say, she began his account of what had happened at Netherfield. She read with an eagerness which hardly left her power of comprehension; and from impatience of knowing what the next sentence might bring, was incapable of attending to the sense of the one before her eyes. His belief of her sister’s insensibility she instantly resolved to be false; and his account of the real, the worst objections to the match, made her too angry to have any wish of doing him justice.

Initially, she was amazed that he thought himself capable of offering any sort of apology and remained firmly convinced that he had no valid explanation that his sense of shame would not conceal. Possessing a strong bias against anything he might say, she began reading his account of the Netherfield events. Her eagerness to read was so great it nearly impaired her comprehension, and her impatience to know what would follow made her unable to fully process the sentence she was currently reading. She immediately decided that his belief regarding her sister's insensitivity was false. Furthermore, his description of the true, most serious objections to the potential marriage made her too angry to even consider if he had a point. She found no satisfying expression of regret for what he had done; his tone was arrogant, not apologetic. To her, it seemed entirely fuelled by pride and insolence.",

Nevertheless, it is easy to imagine how keenly she read it, and how tumultuous her emotions were as she did so. Elizabeth found it almost impossible to describe how she felt. She was astonished at first just to realize that Darcy believed he could offer any sort of apology, and she was certain that any real explanation would be too shameful to reveal. Approaching the letter with strong preconceptions against everything Darcy might say, she started reading his version of what occurred at Netherfield. Her eagerness was so intense that she could barely process the words; she was so impatient to see what would come next that she couldn’t focus on the sentence in front of her. She immediately dismissed his claim that her sister was not interested in Bingley, believing it untrue; and when she got to his explanation of his true reasons for opposing the match, she became so angry that she didn’t attempt to see his side of things. He did not express enough regret to satisfy her—his tone was arrogant rather than remorseful. The whole letter, to her, seemed full of pride and disrespect."

However, after carefully reading and re-reading the immediately following points about Wickham relinquishing all claim to the living in exchange for receiving a considerable sum of three thousand pounds, she was again compelled to hesitate.

Wickham's comments about the living were still fresh in her mind, and as she thought over his precise words, she felt it was clear that someone was being seriously dishonest, and for a moment she indulged the hope that her own wishes were not mistaken. However, as she read and reread with great care the passages relating to Wickham giving up all claims to the living and being given instead the considerable sum of three thousand pounds, her certainty wavered. She set the letter aside and tried to consider every detail as fairly as she could, weighing the likelihood of each person's account, but she found it difficult to decide. Both sides were simply making unproven claims. She returned to the letter for more answers.

Of his former way of life, nothing had been known in Hertfordshire but what he told himself. As to his real character, had information been in her power, she had never felt a wish of inquiring. His countenance, voice, and manner, had established him at once in the possession of every virtue. She tried to recollect some instance of goodness, some distinguished trait of integrity or benevolence, that might rescue him from the attacks of Mr. Darcy; or at least, by the predominance of virtue, atone for those casual errors, under which she would endeavour to class what Mr. Darcy had described as the idleness and vice of many years’ continuance. But no such recollection befriended her. She could see him instantly before her, in every charm of air and address, but she could remember no more substantial good than the general approbation of the neighbourhood, and the regard which his social powers had gained him in the mess. After pausing on this point a considerable while, she once more continued to read. But, alas! the story which followed, of his designs on Miss Darcy, received some confirmation from what had passed between Colonel Fitzwilliam and herself only the morning before; and at last she was referred for the truth of every particular to Colonel Fitzwilliam himself—from whom she had previously received the information of his near concern in all his cousin’s affairs and whose character she had no reason to question.

Locally, nothing about his previous life was known except what he himself revealed. As for his true nature, she had never felt any desire to investigate it, even if she could have. His appearance, voice, and demeanour had immediately convinced her he was perfectly virtuous. She tried to recall specific instances of his kindness, some noteworthy example of honesty or benevolence that might save him from Mr. Darcy's criticisms, or at least allow his perceived virtues to excuse the 'idleness and vice' over many years that Mr. Darcy had described as minor errors. But she couldn't remember anything of the sort. She could instantly picture his appealing look and charming manner, but she could recall nothing more substantial than the general approval of the neighbourhood and the respect his social skills had earned him among the officers. After dwelling on this point for some time, she continued reading. However, the subsequent account of his intentions towards Miss Darcy received some support from her conversation with Colonel Fitzwilliam that very morning; and ultimately, she was directed to Colonel Fitzwilliam himself for verification of all the details—a person she knew was closely involved in his cousin's affairs and whose trustworthiness she had no reason to doubt.

In Hertfordshire, all anyone knew about Mr. Wickham's past was what he himself had shared. She had never cared to inquire into his true character, as his appearance, manner, and speech had instantly convinced her of his virtues. She tried to remember instances of his integrity or kindness that might defend him against Darcy’s accusations, or at least outweigh the faults described as laziness and vice, which she tried to excuse as minor lapses. But she could not recall any such examples. All she could remember was the general approval of the community and the friendships he made in the militia. After thinking this over for some time, she returned to her reading. Unfortunately, the following account of Wickham’s intentions towards Miss Darcy was partially supported by what Colonel Fitzwilliam had told her just the day before. Ultimately, she was advised to seek confirmation from Colonel Fitzwilliam himself, who was closely involved with all of Mr. Darcy's concerns and whose character she trusted. She had considered asking him directly, but the awkwardness of such a conversation put her off, and finally she felt sure Darcy would never have made these claims if he weren’t confident that his cousin would support them."

          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "Her perspective on everything concerning Wickham was now completely reversed. His attentions towards Miss King now appeared to be driven purely by mercenary and repulsive motives; and her modest inheritance no longer indicated his limited desires, but rather his desperation to acquire money. His conduct towards Elizabeth herself could now have no acceptable explanation: he must have either been mistaken about her financial situation or simply been boosting his ego by encouraging the affection she now realized she had shown most imprudently. Any lingering inclination to think well of him diminished steadily. Furthermore, in justification of Mr. Darcy, she had to concede that Mr. Bingley, when questioned by Jane, had long ago confirmed Darcy's innocence in the matter. She also acknowledged that, despite his proud and reserved manner, she had never, throughout their acquaintance (which had lately brought them into closer contact and given her some understanding of his habits), observed anything that suggested he was dishonest or unfair, or that he had immoral or irreligious customs. She knew that his own family and friends esteemed him. Even Wickham himself had admitted Darcy possessed good qualities as a brother, and she had often heard Darcy speak of his sister with such warmth that it demonstrated he was capable of affectionate feeling. She reasoned that if his actions had been as Wickham claimed, such a serious violation of justice could hardly have remained hidden from the public. Lastly, she found it inexplicable that such a pleasant man as Mr. Bingley could maintain a friendship with someone capable of the behaviour Wickham alleged. She became profoundly ashamed of herself. She could not reflect on either Darcy or Wickham without feeling that she had been blind, biased, unfair, and foolish.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "Now everything involving him seemed entirely changed. His interest in Miss King was now clearly motivated by selfish and greedy intentions, and her modest wealth showed not restraint on his part but desperation to obtain any fortune he could. His conduct towards herself could no longer be seen as acceptable: either he had misunderstood her financial situation, or had simply enjoyed the vanity of winning her regard, which she realized she had unguardedly revealed. Any lingering sympathy she had for him became weaker and weaker. In further defense of Mr. Darcy, she remembered that Mr. Bingley, when Jane questioned him, had long before insisted Darcy was blameless in the matter. Although Darcy's manners were proud and sometimes disagreeable, in all her recent and frequent encounters with him, she had never seen anything to suggest he was unethical or unjust, nor anything to indicate irreligion or immorality. Among his own relations he was respected, and even Wickham had admitted he was a good brother. She had also often heard Darcy speak tenderly of his sister, which showed he possessed kind feelings. Had Darcy done all Wickham accused him of, such egregious wrongdoing could hardly have been hidden from society, and a friendship between such a man and the admirable Mr. Bingley would be unthinkable. She felt utterly ashamed of herself. She could not think of either Darcy or Wickham without seeing now that she had been blind, biased, and foolish."

Lady Catherine, accepting this, turned to Mrs. Collins and insisted she send a servant with the young women, arguing that it was highly improper for them to travel post alone. She emphasized the importance of young ladies being properly accompanied, citing how her own niece, Georgiana, had traveled last summer with two male servants for propriety's sake.

Reflection must be reserved for solitary hours: whenever she was alone, she gave way to it as the greatest relief; and not a day went by without a solitary walk, in which she might indulge in all the delight of unpleasant recollections.\nMr. Darcy’s letter she was in a fair way of soon knowing by heart. She studied every sentence; and her feelings towards its writer were at times widely different. When she remembered the style of his address, she was still full of indignation: but when she considered how unjustly she had condemned and upbraided him, her anger was turned against herself; and his disappointed feelings became the object of compassion. His attachment excited gratitude, his general character respect: but she could not approve him; nor could she for a moment repent her refusal, or feel the slightest inclination ever to see him again. In her own past behaviour, there was a constant source of vexation and regret: and in the unhappy defects of her family, a subject of yet heavier chagrin. They were hopeless of remedy. Her father, contented with laughing at them, would never exert himself to restrain the wild giddiness of his youngest daughters; and her mother, with manners so far from right herself, was entirely insensible of the evil. Elizabeth had frequently united with Jane in an endeavour to check the imprudence of Catherine and Lydia; but while they were supported by their mother’s indulgence, what chance could there be of improvement? Catherine, weak-spirited, irritable, and completely under Lydia’s guidance, had been always affronted by their advice; and Lydia, self-willed and careless, would scarcely give them a hearing.

Since she didn't provide the answers herself, attention was required, which Elizabeth considered a blessing; otherwise, with her mind so engrossed, she might have forgotten her location. Reflection had to be saved for moments of solitude; whenever she was alone, she indulged in it, finding it a great comfort. Not a day passed without a solitary walk where she could freely engage in the bittersweet pleasure of dwelling on unhappy memories. Elizabeth was well on her way to knowing Mr. Darcy's letter by heart. She analyzed every sentence, and her feelings toward its author varied greatly at different times. When she remembered the way he had addressed her, she remained filled with indignation. But when she considered how unjustly she had judged and criticized him, her anger turned inward, and she felt pity for his disappointed feelings. His affection prompted gratitude, and his overall character earned her respect, but she could not approve of him. Nor could she for a moment regret turning him down or feel the slightest wish to ever see him again. Her own past behavior was a constant source of annoyance and regret, and the unfortunate flaws of her family caused her even deeper distress, seeming beyond any remedy. Her father, content to merely laugh at them, would never make an effort to control his youngest daughters' reckless abandon, and her mother, lacking proper manners herself, was entirely oblivious to the problem. Elizabeth had often joined with Jane in attempts to curb Catherine and Lydia's impulsive actions, but with their mother's indulgence supporting them, what possibility of improvement was there? Catherine, weak-willed, easily irritated, and completely under Lydia's influence, had always taken offense at their advice, and Lydia, stubborn and careless, would barely listen to them. They were ignorant, idle, and conceited. If there was an officer in Meryton, they would flirt with him, and as long as Meryton was a walk away from Longbourn, they would constantly be heading there.",

She saved her reflections for moments when she was alone, during which she found great relief in revisiting her thoughts, often taking daily solitary walks to dwell on her troubling memories. She grew very familiar with Mr. Darcy's letter, going over every sentence and feeling a variety of emotions towards him. Remembering the tone of the letter made her angry, but when she thought about how wrongly she had judged him, her annoyance turned inward, and she pitied his disappointment. While she felt grateful for his affection and respected his character, she could not approve of him or regret refusing him, nor did she wish to see him again. Her own conduct remained a source of irritation and regret, and she was even more distressed thinking of her family's flaws, which seemed beyond help. Her father only joked about their issues and never tried to control the youngest daughters' carelessness, and her mother, herself lacking proper manners, did not notice the problem. Elizabeth and Jane had often tried to correct Catherine and Lydia, but with their mother encouraging their behavior, change seemed impossible. Catherine, being meek and easily led by Lydia, resented their suggestions, and Lydia, obstinate and thoughtless, hardly listened at all. Both girls were ignorant, lazy, and conceited; as long as there were officers in Meryton, they would flirt with them, and so long as Meryton was nearby, they would always find a reason to go there."

But I hope you know we are very grateful for your gracious visit and that we have tried our best to make your stay pleasant.” Elizabeth quickly thanked him and assured him she’d been very happy during her six-week stay, enjoying Charlotte’s company and everyone’s kindness, which made her feel grateful. Mr. Collins was pleased and, smiling formally, continued, “I’m delighted to hear you haven’t found your time here unpleasant. We’ve tried hard to make things enjoyable, and fortunately, we were able to introduce you to excellent society and regularly vary our routine through our connections with Rosings. I think we can safely say your visit here hasn’t been entirely dull. Our relationship with Lady Catherine’s family is a rare privilege. You see how often we’re invited there and involved in their activities. Honestly, despite the parsonage’s drawbacks, I don’t think anyone should pity those who can share our close ties with Rosings.” His emotions were so strong he had to walk around the room, while Elizabeth tried to respond politely and honestly in a few brief remarks."

Who could about such a nasty little freckled thing?”\nElizabeth was shocked to think that, however incapable of such coarseness of expression herself, the coarseness of the sentiment was little other than her own breast had formerly harboured and fancied liberal!",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "“Are they, truly?” Elizabeth asked with significant satisfaction. “They are scheduled to set up camp near Brighton,” Lydia continued, “and I am so eager for Father to take all of us there for the summer! It would be such a wonderful idea, and I’m sure it would barely cost anything. Mother would absolutely love to go too! Just think how miserable the summer will be otherwise!” Elizabeth thought to herself, “Yes, that would indeed be a delightful plan, guaranteed to ruin us completely. Goodness gracious! Brighton and a whole camp full of soldiers for us, who have already been thrown into disarray by a single poor militia regiment and the monthly dances in Meryton!” As they were seated at the table, Lydia announced, “I have some news for you now. Guess what? It’s fantastic news, absolutely first-class, and it’s about someone we all fond of.” Jane and Elizabeth exchanged glances, and they told the waiter he could leave. Lydia chuckled and said, “Oh, that’s just typical of your carefulness and good sense. You thought the waiter shouldn’t overhear, as if he would care! I bet he hears much worse things said than what I’m about to tell you. But he’s an unattractive man! I’m glad he’s gone. I’ve never seen such a long chin in my life. Anyway, back to my news: it’s about dear Wickham; too important for the waiter, wouldn’t you say? There’s no longer any risk of Wickham marrying Mary King—there! She has gone to stay with her uncle in Liverpool; she’s gone for good. Wickham is safe.” “And Mary King is safe!” Elizabeth added, “safe from a connection that would have been unwise regarding wealth.” “She’s incredibly silly for leaving if she liked him,” Lydia commented. “But I hope there isn’t a deep affection on either side,” Jane said. “I am certain there isn’t on his part. I can promise you he never cared about her in the slightest. Who could possibly care about such a plain, freckled little person?” Elizabeth was disturbed to realise that, while she herself would never use such crude words, the unpleasantness of the feeling was not much different from what she herself had previously felt and considered broad-minded!",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "\"Are they really?\" exclaimed Elizabeth, feeling very pleased. \"They're going to set up camp near Brighton, and I so wish Father would take us all there this summer! It would be such a wonderful plan, and I bet it wouldn't cost much at all. Mother would absolutely love to go, too! Just think how dreadful our summer will be otherwise!\" \n\n\"Yes,\" mused Elizabeth, \"that truly would be an excellent idea, and quite overwhelm us. Goodness! Brighton and an entire camp of soldiers, when we've already been thrown into excitement by just one regiment of militia and Meryton's monthly balls!\"\n\n\"Now I have some news for you,\" Lydia announced as they sat down to eat. \"Guess what? It's excellent, really top news, and about someone we all like.\"\n\nJane and Elizabeth exchanged glances, and told the waiter he could leave. Lydia laughed and said, \"That's just like you—so proper and careful. You thought the waiter shouldn't hear, as if he'd care! I bet he hears worse things than I'm going to say. But he's ugly! I'm glad he's gone, I've never seen such a long chin before. Anyway, here's my news: it's about dear Wickham; too good for the waiter to hear, isn't it? There's no risk now of Wickham marrying Mary King—guess what! She's gone to stay with her uncle in Liverpool. Wickham is free.\"\n\n\"And Mary King is safe!\" added Elizabeth. \"Safe from such a risky marriage for someone in her situation.\"\n\n\"She's a fool to leave if she liked him.\"\n\n\"But I hope neither of them was deeply attached,\" Jane said.\n\n\"I'm sure he wasn't—I'll bet he never cared at all for her. Who could, for such a silly little freckled girl?\"\n\nElizabeth was appalled to realize that, though she would never speak so crudely herself, she had once felt much the same unkind sentiment in her own mind and even thought herself generous for it!"

She is almost three-and-twenty! Lord! how ashamed I should be of not being married before three-and-twenty! My aunt Philips wants you so to get husbands you can’t think.

Not a soul knew of it, but Colonel and Mrs. Forster, and Kitty and me, except my aunt, for we were forced to borrow one of her gowns; and you cannot imagine how well he looked! When Denny, and Wickham, and Pratt, and two or three more of the men came in, they did not know him in the least. Lord! how I laughed! and so did Mrs. Forster. I thought I should have died.

Well, let’s get really comfortable and cozy now, and talk and laugh the entire way home. First off, tell us everything that’s happened to you since you left. Did you meet any pleasant men?

She thinks Lizzy should have accepted Mr. Collins, but I don’t think that would have been any fun. Lord, how I’d love to be married before any of you! And then I could take you to all the dances as your chaperone. Oh dear! We had such a great time the other day at Colonel Forster’s! Kitty and I were spending the day there, and Mrs. Forster promised to have a small dance in the evening (by the way, Mrs. Forster and I are *such* good friends!). So she invited the two Harringtons, but Harriet was ill, so Pen had to come by herself. And then, guess what we did?

When Denny, and Wickham, and Pratt, and two or three other men came in, they didn’t recognize him at all. Lord, I laughed so much! And so did Mrs. Forster. I thought I was going to die laughing.

What a stroke was this for poor Jane, who would willingly have gone through the world without believing that so much wickedness existed in the whole race of mankind as was here collected in one individual! Nor was Darcy’s vindication, though grateful to her feelings, capable of consoling her for such discovery. Most earnestly did she labour to prove the probability of error, and seek to clear one, without involving the other.\n“This will not do,” said Elizabeth; “you never will be able to make both of them good for anything. Take your choice, but you must be satisfied with only one. There is but such a quantity of merit between them; just enough to make one good sort of man; and of late it has been shifting about pretty much. For my part, I am inclined to believe it all Mr. Darcy’s, but you shall do as you choose.”\nIt was some time, however, before a smile could be extorted from Jane.\n“I do not know when I have been more shocked,” said she. “Wickham so very bad! It is almost past belief. And poor Mr. Darcy! dear Lizzy, only consider what he must have suffered. Such a disappointment! and with the knowledge of your ill opinion too! and having to relate such a thing of his sister! It is really too distressing, I am sure you must feel it so.”\n“Oh no, my regret and compassion are all done away by seeing you so full of both. I know you will do him such ample justice, that I am growing every moment more unconcerned and indifferent. Your profusion makes me saving; and if you lament over him much longer, my heart will be as light as a feather.”\n“Poor Wickham! there is such an expression of goodness in his countenance! such an openness and gentleness in his manner.”\n“There certainly was some great mismanagement in the education of those two young men. One has got all the goodness, and the other all the appearance of it.”\n“I never thought Mr. Darcy so deficient in the appearance of it as you used to do.”\n“And yet I meant to be uncommonly clever in taking so decided a dislike to him, without any reason. It is such a spur to one’s genius, such an opening for wit, to have a dislike of that kind. One may be continually abusive without saying anything just; but one cannot be always laughing at a man without now and then stumbling on something witty.”\n“Lizzy, when you first read that letter, I am sure you could not treat the matter as you do now.”\n“Indeed, I could not. I was uncomfortable enough, I was very uncomfortable—I may say unhappy. And with no one to speak to of what I felt, no Jane to comfort me, and say that I had not been so very weak, and vain, and nonsensical, as I knew I had! Oh, how I wanted you!”\n",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "You will understand when I tell you what happened the very next day. She then discussed the letter, repeating everything in it concerning George Wickham. This news was devastating for poor Jane, who wished she could go through life without believing that such a degree of wickedness, as was concentrated in one person, could exist in all of humanity! Although she was grateful that Darcy was cleared, it couldn't fully console her given the shocking truth about Wickham. She desperately tried to find a way to believe it was a mistake, trying to excuse one man without condemning the other. Elizabeth replied, 'That won't work; you'll never be able to make both of them out to be decent people. Choose one, but you must accept only one. There's only a certain amount of goodness between them, just enough for one genuinely good man, and that goodness has been moving around quite a bit recently. Personally, I tend to think all the merit belongs to Mr. Darcy, but you can decide for yourself.' It took some time, however, before Jane could manage a smile. 'I don't know when I've been so shocked,' she said. 'Wickham being so incredibly bad! It's almost unbelievable. And poor Mr. Darcy! Dear Lizzy, just think how much he must have suffered. Such a disappointment! And knowing you thought so badly of him too! And having to reveal such a story about his own sister! It's truly upsetting; I'm sure you must feel it too.' 'Oh no,' Elizabeth responded, 'my sympathy and pity are completely cancelled out by seeing how full of both you are. I know you will do him such complete justice that I'm becoming less and less concerned and bothered by the moment. Your abundance of feeling makes me feel less; and if you continue to feel sorry for him for much longer, my heart will be as light as a feather.' 'Poor Wickham!' Jane sighed, 'there is such an look of kindness in his face! Such open and gentle manners.' 'There must have been some major errors in the way those two young men were brought up,' Elizabeth concluded. 'One ended up with all the real goodness, and the other with only the outward appearance of it.' 'I never thought Mr. Darcy lacked the *appearance* of goodness as much as you did,' Jane countered. 'And yet I intended to be unusually clever by taking such a definite dislike to him, for no reason at all. It's such a stimulation to one's cleverness, such an opportunity for wit, to have that kind of unfounded dislike. You can constantly criticize without saying anything fair, but you can't always laugh at someone without occasionally coming up with something clever.' 'Lizzy, when you first read that letter, I'm sure you couldn't have treated the matter so casually,' Jane observed. 'Indeed, I couldn't,' Elizabeth agreed. 'I was quite uncomfortable, very uncomfortable indeed—I might even say unhappy. And with no one to talk to about what I felt, no Jane to comfort me and tell me I hadn't been as utterly weak, and vain, and silly as I knew I had been! Oh, how much I needed you then!'",

For poor Jane, this was a heavy blow; she had preferred to believe that such wickedness did not exist, let alone in one person. Even though she appreciated Darcy’s justification, it still pained her to discover the truth; she tried hard to find a mistake in Darcy’s account, hoping to defend one man without condemning the other.\n\nElizabeth interrupted, \"That won't work; you can't make both of them blameless. You'll have to choose—there is only so much goodness to go around, enough for just one upright man; lately, it's been moving between them. Personally, I think Mr. Darcy deserves it all, but you may decide as you like.\"\n\nJane, however, could not be cheered easily. \"I've rarely been more stunned,\" she said. \"Wickham, so wicked? It's almost unbelievable. And poor Mr. Darcy! Lizzy, imagine what he must have felt—such a disappointment, especially knowing you didn’t think well of him, and having to reveal such things about his sister! It’s truly distressing; I’m sure you must feel it, too.\"\n\nElizabeth replied, \"Oh, my pity and sorrow are vanishing as I see how much you feel both for him. I know you’ll defend him so thoroughly that I’m actually becoming much less troubled about the whole matter. If you keep mourning for him, soon I’ll feel completely carefree.\"\n\n\"Poor Wickham!\" Jane sighed, \"He seems so good—his face and his manner are so honest and gentle.\"\n\nElizabeth replied, \"Clearly, something went wrong with how those two were raised. One of them got all the real goodness, the other just the appearance of it.\"\n\nJane said, \"I never thought Mr. Darcy lacked the appearance of goodness as much as you once did.\"\n\nElizabeth admitted, \"And yet, I thought I was being very clever to dislike him without any real cause. Having such a strong dislike is quite good for one's wit—one can keep making jokes, even if they're unfair, but occasionally you accidentally say something clever.\"\n\n\"Lizzy,\" said Jane, \"When you first read that letter, you surely couldn’t treat it so flippantly.\"\n\n\"Indeed not,\" Elizabeth answered. \"I was very upset—unhappy, really. I didn’t have anyone to confide in, no Jane to reassure me that I hadn’t been quite so silly and vain as I feared I had. How much I wished for your comfort!\""

Yes, yes. They will take care not to outrun their income. They will never be distressed for money. Well, much good may it do them!

Elizabeth tried to be diverted by them; but all sense of pleasure was lost in shame. She felt anew the justice of Mr. Darcy’s objections; and never had she before been so much disposed to pardon his interference in the views of his friend.\nBut the gloom of Lydia’s prospect was shortly cleared away; for she received an invitation from Mrs. Forster, the wife of the colonel of the regiment, to accompany her to Brighton. This invaluable friend was a very young woman, and very lately married. A resemblance in good-humour and good spirits had recommended her and Lydia to each other, and out of their three months’ acquaintance they had been intimate two.\nThe rapture of Lydia on this occasion, her adoration of Mrs. Forster, the delight of Mrs. Bennet, and the mortification of Kitty, are scarcely to be described. Wholly inattentive to her sister’s feelings, Lydia flew about the house in restless ecstasy, calling for everyone’s congratulations, and laughing and talking with more violence than ever; whilst the luckless Kitty continued in the parlour repining at her fate in terms as unreasonable as her accent was peevish.\n“I cannot see why Mrs. Forster should not ask me as well as Lydia,” said she, “though I am not her particular friend.

Mrs. Bennet commented that some time by the sea would restore her health completely and permanently. Kitty joined in, stating that her Aunt Philips was positive it would do her personally a great deal of good. Such complaints were constantly heard echoing through Longbourn House. Elizabeth attempted to find amusement in them, but any pleasure she might have felt was overshadowed by shame. She felt renewed justification for Mr. Darcy’s earlier criticisms and had never before been so inclined to excuse his involvement in his friend's romantic affairs. However, the prospect of unhappiness for Lydia soon vanished; she received an invitation from Mrs. Forster, the wife of the regiment's colonel, to accompany her to Brighton. This valuable friend was a very young woman, only recently married. A shared cheerful and lively disposition had drawn her and Lydia together, and they had been very close for two out of the three months they had known each other. The intensity of Lydia's joy on hearing this news, her admiration for Mrs. Forster, the sheer delight of Mrs. Bennet, and the deep disappointment of Kitty are almost impossible to describe. Completely ignoring her sister’s feelings, Lydia excitedly rushed around the house in restless happiness, demanding congratulations from everyone, laughing and talking with even more force than usual; while the unfortunate Kitty remained in the drawing-room, lamenting her misfortune in terms as unreasonable as her voice was peevish. \"I don’t understand why Mrs. Forster didn’t ask me as well as Lydia,\" she complained, \"even though I’m not her special friend. I have just as much right to be invited as she does, and even more, because I am two years older.\" Elizabeth tried in vain to make her listen to reason, and Jane similarly tried to get her to accept the situation. As for Elizabeth herself, this invitation stirred feelings completely contrary to those of her mother and Lydia. She saw it as the final blow to any chance of Lydia ever developing common sense.

These repeated complaints filled the house, and Elizabeth tried to find amusement in them, but instead, she only felt embarrassment and understood Mr. Darcy’s criticisms better, feeling more inclined to forgive his interference in the past.\n\nHowever, Lydia’s discontent soon vanished when Mrs. Forster, the colonel’s young wife and Lydia’s recent close friend, invited her to Brighton. Lydia was overjoyed, her mother was thrilled, but Kitty was very upset. Lydia was inconsiderate of her sister’s feelings, eagerly telling everyone about the invitation, while Kitty sulked, arguing that she deserved to go as much as Lydia since she was older. Elizabeth and Jane tried to comfort her, but with little success. For Elizabeth, this invitation only made her more concerned about Lydia’s behavior and she secretly suggested to her father that Lydia should not be allowed to go, fearing it would lead to more trouble."

In her mind, she pictured the lively seaside town full of officers; she imagined herself drawing the attention of dozens she had yet to meet.

Her answer was warmly in his favour. With an air of indifference, he soon afterwards added, “How long did you say that he was at Rosings?”\n“Nearly three weeks.”\n“And you saw him frequently?”\n“Yes, almost every day.”\n“His manners are very different from his cousin’s.”\n“Yes, very different; but I think Mr. Darcy improves on acquaintance.”\n“Indeed!” cried Wickham, with a look which did not escape her. “And pray may I ask—” but checking himself, he added, in a gayer tone, “Is it in address that he improves?

His pride, in that direction, may be of service, if not to himself, to many others, for it must deter him from such foul misconduct as I have suffered by. I only fear that the sort of cautiousness to which you, I imagine, have been alluding, is merely adopted on his visits to his aunt, of whose good opinion and judgment he stands much in awe. His fear of her has always operated, I know, when they were together; and a good deal is to be imputed to his wish of forwarding the match with Miss de Bourgh, which I am certain he has very much at heart.”\nElizabeth could not repress a smile at this, but she answered only by a slight inclination of the head. She saw that he wanted to engage her on the old subject of his grievances, and she was in no humour to indulge him.

He appeared surprised, annoyed, and worried, but after a moment's thought and with a return of his smile, he replied that he had known him well previously. After noting that the Colonel was a very gentlemanly man, he asked her what she thought of him. Her answer was strongly in his favour. Seemingly casually, he then added, \"How long did you say he was at Rosings?\" \"Almost three weeks.\" \"And you saw him often?\" \"Yes, nearly every day.\" \"His manners are very different from his cousin's.\" \"Yes, quite different; but I find that Mr. Darcy is better liked the more one gets to know him.\" \"Indeed!\" Wickham exclaimed, with a look she did not miss. \"And might I perhaps ask—\" but he stopped himself and added, in a lighter tone, \"Is it in his bearing that he improves? Has he condescended to add any politeness to his usual manner? For I hardly dare hope,\" he continued, speaking more quietly and seriously, \"that he has improved in fundamental ways.\" \"Oh, no!\" Elizabeth said. \"In essentials, I believe, he is just as he always was.\" As she spoke, Wickham looked as if he was unsure whether to be pleased by her words or to doubt their meaning. There was something in her expression that made him listen with nervous and watchful attention, as she clarified: \"When I said he improved on acquaintance, I didn't mean that his character or behaviour were getting better, but rather that, by knowing him longer, his true nature was better understood.\" Wickham's alarm now showed in a heightened colour and agitated expression; he was silent for a few minutes, until, overcoming his discomfort, he turned back to her and said in the gentlest tone, \"You, who are so familiar with my feelings towards Mr. Darcy, will readily understand how sincerely I must be glad that he is sensible enough to at least adopt the appearance of acting correctly. In that respect, his pride might be useful, if not for himself, then for many others, as it must deter him from such terrible conduct as I have experienced. I only fear that the kind of cautiousness you, I imagine, have been referring to, is merely assumed when he visits his aunt, whose high opinion and judgment he greatly respects. His fear of her has always influenced him, I know, when they were together; and a good deal is also likely due to his wish to promote the marriage with Miss de Bourgh, which I am certain is very important to him.\" Elizabeth could not help but smile at this, but she only responded with a slight nod.

Wickham seemed startled and uneasy, but after regaining his composure, he said he had met him before, called him a gentleman, and inquired how Elizabeth found him. Elizabeth spoke warmly of the colonel. Wickham, trying to act unaffected, then questioned how long the colonel had stayed and if Elizabeth had seen him often. She replied that she had, almost daily, and noted that his demeanor was quite different from Mr. Darcy's. Elizabeth added that she thought Darcy improved with familiarity. Wickham replied with surprise and a hint of distrust, asking if Darcy's improved merely in his manner and not in his true character, since he doubted Darcy had changed at heart. Elizabeth assured him that, fundamentally, Darcy was much the same as always. Wickham seemed unsure whether to be pleased or suspicious, noticing something in Elizabeth's expression that made him listen anxiously. Elizabeth clarified that she didn't mean Darcy had changed, but that as she got to know him, she understood his character better. Wickham, now visibly unsettled, was silent for a moment before regaining his composure and saying gently that, knowing how he felt about Darcy, she could imagine he would be glad that Darcy could at least pretend to be proper around others. He suggested that Darcy's pride might prevent him from repeating past wrongs—at least in company or before his aunt, Lady Catherine, whose opinion he cares about—and added that Darcy probably behaved well to further his prospects with Miss de Bourgh. Elizabeth simply smiled, recognizing Wickham's attempt to revisit his old complaints, which she did not encourage.

Mrs. Bennet was elaborate in expressing her hopes for her daughter's happiness and forceful in urging her to take advantage of the opportunity to have as much fun as possible—counsel that was widely expected to be heeded. Amidst Lydia's own noisy delight in saying farewell, the more subdued goodbyes offered by her sisters were delivered without being noticed.",

The departure from her family was more loud and boisterous than emotional. Kitty was the only one who cried, but it was out of annoyance and jealousy. Mrs. Bennet offered many warm wishes for her daughter's happiness and strongly encouraged her to take full advantage of the pleasures before her—suggestions that Lydia was sure to follow. Amid Lydia's noisy excitement as she said goodbye, her sisters' quieter farewells went unnoticed."

Her father, captivated by youth and beauty, and that appearance of good-humour which youth and beauty generally give, had married a woman whose weak understanding and illiberal mind had very early in their marriage put an end to all real affection for her. Respect, esteem, and confidence had vanished for ever; and all his views of domestic happiness were overthrown. But Mr. Bennet was not of a disposition to seek comfort for the disappointment which his own imprudence had brought on in any of those pleasures which too often console the unfortunate for their folly or their vice. He was fond of the country and of books; and from these tastes had arisen his principal enjoyments. To his wife he was very little otherwise indebted than as her ignorance and folly had contributed to his amusement. This is not the sort of happiness which a man would in general wish to owe to his wife; but where other powers of entertainment are wanting, the true philosopher will derive benefit from such as are given.\nElizabeth, however, had never been blind to the impropriety of her father’s behaviour as a husband. She had always seen it with pain; but respecting his abilities, and grateful for his affectionate treatment of herself, she endeavoured to forget what she could not overlook, and to banish from her thoughts that continual breach of conjugal obligation and decorum which, in exposing his wife to the contempt of her own children, was so highly reprehensible. But she had never felt so strongly as now the disadvantages which must attend the children of so unsuitable a marriage, nor ever been so fully aware of the evils arising from so ill-judged a direction of talents—talents which, rightly used, might at least have preserved the respectability of his daughters, even if incapable of enlarging the mind of his wife.",

Her father, drawn in by youth, beauty, and the appearance of good nature these qualities often lend, had wed a woman whose poor intellect and narrow mindset very quickly extinguished any real affection for her within their marriage. Respect, admiration, and trust were gone forever, and all his hopes for a happy domestic life were ruined. But Mr. Bennet was not inclined to seek comfort for the disappointment his own lack of judgment had caused in the kinds of pleasures that too often serve as solace for the unfortunate consequences of people's mistakes or vices. He enjoyed the countryside and books, and these preferences were the source of his main satisfactions. He owed his wife very little, except for the amusement he derived from her lack of knowledge and sense. This is not the sort of happiness one would generally want from a spouse, but where other sources of enjoyment are missing, a wise person will make use of what is available. Elizabeth, however, had never been unaware of how improperly her father behaved as a husband. She had always found it upsetting to see, but respecting his intelligence and appreciating his kind treatment of her, she tried to disregard what she could not fail to notice, and to remove from her mind that ongoing failure to meet marital obligations and maintain decorum, which was so highly blameworthy, especially as it subjected his wife to her own children's scorn. But she had never felt as intensely as she did now the disadvantages that must affect the children of such a mismatched union, nor had she ever been so fully conscious of the troubles stemming from such a poor direction of his talents—talents that, if properly employed, could have at least ensured his daughters' social standing, even if they couldn't expand his wife's mind.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "If Elizabeth had based her ideas about marriage and family life solely on her own experience, she would not have had a very positive impression. Her father had been attracted by youth, beauty, and cheerful looks, leading him to marry a woman who, due to her lack of intelligence and narrow-mindedness, quickly lost his affection. Any respect and trust he had for her disappeared early in their marriage, and his hopes for a happy home were dashed. However, Mr. Bennet did not try to seek relief for his disappointment in pleasures that many people might use to forget their own mistakes. Instead, he took comfort in rural life and reading, which became his main sources of happiness. He only depended on his wife in the sense that her foolishness provided him with some amusement—a kind of satisfaction most men would not wish to derive from their wives, but in the absence of better alternatives, a wise person makes use of what is available. Elizabeth had always been acutely aware of how inappropriately her father behaved as a husband, and although it pained her, she tried, out of gratitude for his kindness and respect for his intelligence, to forgive what she couldn't ignore. She attempted to push aside the constant failure of her father to uphold his marital duties, a failure that made her mother a figure of ridicule to her own children. Never before had Elizabeth felt as strongly the drawbacks faced by children of parents so badly matched, nor realized so clearly the problems that come from wasting one's talents—talents that, if directed properly, could have at least maintained her daughters' social standing, even if they failed to improve her mother's mind."

Their parties abroad were less varied than before; and at home she had a mother and sister, whose constant repinings at the dulness of everything around them threw a real gloom over their domestic circle; and, though Kitty might in time regain her natural degree of sense, since the disturbers of her brain were removed, her other sister, from whose disposition greater evil might be apprehended, was likely to be hardened in all her folly and assurance, by a situation of such double danger as a watering-place and a camp. Upon the whole, therefore, she found, what has been sometimes found before, that an event to which she had looked forward with impatient desire, did not, in taking place, bring all the satisfaction she had promised herself. It was consequently necessary to name some other period for the commencement of actual felicity; to have some other point on which her wishes and hopes might be fixed, and by again enjoying the pleasure of anticipation, console herself for the present, and prepare for another disappointment. Her tour to the Lakes was now the object of her happiest thoughts: it was her best consolation for all the uncomfortable hours which the discontentedness of her mother and Kitty made inevitable; and could she have included Jane in the scheme, every part of it would have been perfect.\n“But it is fortunate,” thought she, “that I have something to wish for. Were the whole arrangement complete, my disappointment would be certain. But here, by carrying with me one ceaseless source of regret in my sister’s absence, I may reasonably hope to have all my expectations of pleasure realized. A scheme of which every part promises delight can never be successful; and general disappointment is only warded off by the defence of some little peculiar vexation.”",

Their social activities outside the home became less diverse, and at home, her mother and sister's constant complaints about the dullness of their lives cast a real shadow over the family. While Kitty might eventually regain her good sense now that the influences distracting her were gone, her other sister, Lydia, from whom greater trouble was likely, seemed destined to become more firmly set in her silliness and overconfidence because she was in a risky situation combining a spa town and a military camp. As a result, Elizabeth discovered, as others sometimes have, that an event she had eagerly looked forward to did not bring all the happiness she expected once it actually happened. Consequently, she needed to set a new future date for true contentment; she needed another focus for her wishes and hopes, so that by enjoying the pleasure of looking forward again, she could console herself in the present and prepare for another potential letdown. Her planned trip to the Lakes now became the object of her happiest thoughts; it was her greatest comfort against all the difficult hours made unavoidable by her mother and Kitty's dissatisfaction. If she could have included Jane in the plan, every aspect of it would have been perfect. \"But it is fortunate,\" she thought, \"that I have something to still wish for. If the entire arrangement were already complete, my disappointment would be guaranteed. But here, by carrying with me one continuous source of regret in my sister's absence, I can reasonably hope for all my expectations of pleasure to be met. A plan where every part promises delight is never successful; and overall disappointment is only fended off by the defence of some small, particular annoyance.\"",

Their social gatherings became less interesting, and at home, her mother and sister's constant complaints about the monotony of their lives made the household atmosphere gloomy. While Kitty might eventually return to her usual self now that her bad influences were gone, her other sister—whose behavior was more concerning—would probably become even more foolish and bold, given the temptations of a resort town and a military encampment. Overall, Elizabeth discovered, as others had before her, that an event she had eagerly awaited did not bring her the happiness she had expected. This meant she had to find a new time to look forward to for real happiness—to set her hopes on something else and, by anticipating that, comfort herself for the present and brace herself for another letdown. Now, planning a trip to the Lakes was her chief source of happiness and her only real consolation amidst the dreary moods of her mother and Kitty. If only Jane could be included in this plan, it would be perfect. Still, Elizabeth thought it was a good thing to have something left to wish for; if everything went exactly as she wanted, disappointment would be unavoidable. By having at least one regret—Jane's absence—she could still hope for enjoyment. Any plan that promises absolute delight is doomed to fail, and only by having a small, specific frustration can one avoid total disappointment."

She must own that she was tired of great houses: after going over so many, she really had no pleasure in fine carpets or satin curtains.\nMrs. Gardiner abused her stupidity. “If it were merely a fine house richly furnished,” said she, “I should not care about it myself; but the grounds are delightful. They have some of the finest woods in the country.”\nElizabeth said no more; but her mind could not acquiesce. The possibility of meeting Mr. Darcy, while viewing the place, instantly occurred. It would be dreadful! She blushed at the very idea; and thought it would be better to speak openly to her aunt, than to run such a risk. But against this there were objections; and she finally resolved that it could be the last resource, if her private inquiries as to the absence of the family were unfavourably answered.\nAccordingly, when she retired at night, she asked the chambermaid whether Pemberley were not a very fine place, what was the name of its proprietor, and, with no little alarm, whether the family were down for the summer? A most welcome negative followed the last question; and her alarms being now removed, she was at leisure to feel a great deal of curiosity to see the house herself; and when the subject was revived the next morning, and she was again applied to, could readily answer, and with a proper air of indifference, that she had not really any dislike to the scheme.\nTo Pemberley, therefore, they were to go.",

Elizabeth felt uneasy. She thought she shouldn't visit Pemberley and had to feign disinterest in seeing it. She claimed she was tired of visiting large estates and no longer enjoyed fine carpets or satin curtains after seeing so many. Mrs. Gardiner scolded her for being foolish, saying that if it were just a grand, well-furnished house, she wouldn't be bothered either, but emphasized the delightful grounds and some of the country's most impressive woods. Elizabeth didn't respond further, but inwardly she couldn't agree. The possibility of encountering Mr. Darcy while viewing the place immediately came to mind, and she found the idea terrifying, blushing intensely. She considered telling her aunt the truth openly rather than risking such a meeting, but decided against it for various reasons, ultimately resolving it would be a last option if her quiet inquiries about the family's absence were not favourable. Consequently, that night, she asked the chambermaid if Pemberley was a very nice place, who owned it, and, with considerable worry, if the family was staying there for the summer. The negative response to the final question was very welcome, and with her anxieties now gone, she was free to feel a great deal of curiosity about seeing the house herself.

Mrs. Gardiner dismissed this as foolishness, saying that while a fancy house alone didn't interest her, Pemberley's grounds were exceptional, boasting some of the loveliest woods. Elizabeth dropped the subject but privately worried about possibly encountering Mr. Darcy during their visit. The idea embarrassed her, prompting her to consider telling her aunt the truth, though she decided to wait and see if the family was at home. That night, she discreetly questioned a maid about the estate and was relieved to learn the family was away for the summer. Relieved, curiosity replaced her apprehension.

          "text_segment": "Elizabeth, as they drove along, watched for the first appearance of Pemberley Woods with some perturbation; and when at length they turned in at the lodge, her spirits were in a high flutter.\nThe park was very large, and contained great variety of ground. They entered it in one of its lowest points, and drove for some time through a beautiful wood stretching over a wide extent.\nElizabeth’s mind was too full for conversation, but she saw and admired every remarkable spot and point of view. They gradually ascended for half a mile, and then found themselves at the top of a considerable eminence, where the wood ceased, and the eye was instantly caught by Pemberley House, situated on the opposite side of the valley, into which the road with some abruptness wound. It was a large, handsome stone building, standing well on rising ground, and backed by a ridge of high woody hills; and in front a stream of some natural importance was swelled into greater, but without any artificial appearance. Its banks were neither formal nor falsely adorned. Elizabeth was delighted. She had never seen a place for which nature had done more, or where natural beauty had been so little counteracted by an awkward taste. They were all of them warm in their admiration; and at that moment she felt that to be mistress of Pemberley might be something!\nThey descended the hill, crossed the bridge, and drove to the door; and, while examining the nearer aspect of the house, all her apprehension of meeting its owner returned. She dreaded lest the chambermaid had been mistaken. On applying to see the place, they were admitted into the hall; and Elizabeth, as they waited for the housekeeper, had leisure to wonder at her being where she was.\nThe housekeeper came; a respectable looking elderly woman, much less fine, and more civil, than she had any notion of finding her. They followed her into the dining-parlour. It was a large, well-proportioned room, handsomely fitted up. Elizabeth, after slightly surveying it, went to a window to enjoy its prospect. The hill, crowned with wood, from which they had descended, receiving increased abruptness from the distance, was a beautiful object. Every disposition of the ground was good; and she looked on the whole scene, the river, the trees scattered on its banks, and the winding of the valley, as far as she could trace it, with delight. As they passed into other rooms, these objects were taking different positions; but from every window there were beauties to be seen. The rooms were lofty and handsome, and their furniture suitable to the fortune of their proprietor; but Elizabeth saw, with admiration of his taste, that it was neither gaudy nor uselessly fine,—with less of splendour, and more real elegance, than the furniture of Rosings.\n“And of this place,” thought she, “I might have been mistress! With these rooms I might have now been familiarly acquainted! Instead of viewing them as a stranger, I might have rejoiced in them as my own, and welcomed to them as visitors my uncle and aunt. But, no,” recollecting herself, “that could never be; my uncle and aunt would have been lost to me; I should not have been allowed to invite them.”\nThis was a lucky recollection—it saved her from something like regret.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "As they journeyed, Elizabeth felt a sense of nervousness anticipating the first glimpse of Pemberley Woods, and her heart raced with excitement when they eventually turned into the estate entrance. The park was vast and diverse in its terrain. They entered the property at one of its lower points and drove for a while through a lovely forest that covered a large area. Elizabeth was too absorbed in her thoughts to talk, but she observed and appreciated every notable feature and scenic view. They drove uphill for about half a mile, reaching the top of a significant rise where the woods ended. Suddenly, Pemberley House came into view, situated across the valley, down which the road descended somewhat steeply. It was a substantial, attractive building made of stone, well-positioned on elevated ground and backed by a line of tall, tree-covered hills. In front, a naturally important stream was enhanced into a larger one, yet it still looked natural, without overly formal or artificial banks. Elizabeth was thrilled. She felt she had never encountered a place where nature's contribution was so significant, and where its natural beauty hadn't been spoiled by poor design. They were all openly admiring the estate, and in that moment, she considered that being the mistress of Pemberley might indeed be quite desirable. They drove down the hill, crossed the bridge, and arrived at the entrance. As she took in the immediate view of the house, her anxiety about potentially encountering its owner resurfaced. She worried the chambermaid might have been mistaken about his absence. When they requested a tour, they were led into the hall. While waiting for the housekeeper, Elizabeth had time to reflect on the unexpected circumstances that brought her there. The housekeeper arrived; a respectable elderly woman who was much less pretentious and more pleasant than Elizabeth had expected. They followed her into the dining room, which was a large, well-balanced room beautifully decorated. After a quick look around, Elizabeth went to a window to enjoy the view. The wooded hill they had descended from appeared even steeper in the distance and was a striking sight. The layout of the landscape was excellent, and she gazed with pleasure upon the entire scene – the river, the scattered trees along its banks, and the winding valley stretching as far as she could see. As they moved through other rooms, these elements of the landscape appeared from different angles, but beauty was visible from every window. The rooms were spacious and elegant, and their furnishings were appropriate for the owner's wealth, but Elizabeth noted with admiration that his taste was neither flashy nor unnecessarily elaborate. The furniture showed more genuine sophistication and less extravagance than that at Rosings. “And I could have been the mistress of this place!” she thought to herself. “I could have been completely familiar with these rooms by now! Instead of seeing them as a visitor, I could have enjoyed them as my own and welcomed my uncle and aunt here as guests. But no,” she corrected herself, remembering the reality, “that could never have happened; I would have lost touch with my uncle and aunt; I wouldn't have been allowed to invite them.” This was a fortunate thought; it spared her from experiencing something akin to regret.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "As Elizabeth rode along, she anxiously awaited her first glimpse of Pemberley Woods; when they finally entered the lodge gates, her excitement was palpable. The park was expansive and offered varied scenery. They entered at one of its lower points and traveled for a while through a beautiful, sprawling forest. Though Elizabeth was too preoccupied to speak, she appreciated every notable feature and scenic view they passed. The carriage gradually climbed for about half a mile before reaching a significant hilltop where the trees ended, revealing Pemberley House across the valley, with the road winding sharply down toward it. The house was a large, attractive stone structure standing on raised ground, backed by wooded hills and with a stream in front, naturally widened but unobstructed by artificial design. The stream’s banks were left unmanicured and genuinely picturesque. Elizabeth was enchanted, never having seen a place that owed so much to nature or where natural beauty had been preserved so carefully. Everyone expressed admiration, and in that moment Elizabeth thought that being the mistress of Pemberley would truly mean something.\n\nThey then descended the hill, crossed a bridge, and approached the house; as they looked at it up close, Elizabeth’s nervousness about possibly meeting the owner returned, worried that the maid had been mistaken. When they asked to tour the house, they were allowed inside the hall, and while waiting for the housekeeper, Elizabeth reflected on how strange it was that she was there.\n\nThe housekeeper arrived—a respectable, elderly woman, less fancy but friendlier than Elizabeth had expected. The group followed her into the dining room, a spacious, elegantly furnished area. After a quick glance around, Elizabeth went to a window to enjoy the view: the wooded hill they had just descended looked even more dramatic from a distance. Every aspect of the grounds seemed well-planned, and Elizabeth admired the entire scene—the river, the scattered trees along its banks, the valley winding away—as much as she could see. As they moved through other rooms, the same beautiful features came into view from different perspectives. The rooms were grand and well-matched to the owner’s wealth, but Elizabeth admired that the decor was tasteful, elegant, and not gaudy or overly splendid, with more true refinement than she’d seen at Rosings.\n\nElizabeth thought to herself that she might have been the mistress of this place, comfortably familiar with these rooms and able to welcome her uncle and aunt as guests—had things been different. But she quickly realized that in such a situation, she likely would have lost her relationship with them, as she would not have been allowed to invite them. This realization spared her from feeling real regret."

She approached, and saw the likeness of Mr. Wickham, suspended, amongst several other miniatures, over the mantel-piece. Her aunt asked her, smilingly, how she liked it. The housekeeper came forward, and told them it was the picture of a young gentleman, the son of her late master’s steward, who had been brought up by him at his own expense. “He is now gone into the army,” she added; “but I am afraid he has turned out very wild.”\nMrs. Gardiner looked at her niece with a smile, but Elizabeth could not return it.\n“And that,” said Mrs. Reynolds, pointing to another of the miniatures, “is my master—and very like him.

But, Lizzy, you can tell us whether it is like or not.”\nMrs. Reynolds’ respect for Elizabeth seemed to increase on this intimation of her knowing her master.\n“Does that young lady know Mr. Darcy?”\nElizabeth coloured, and said, “A little.”\n“And do not you think him a very handsome gentleman, ma’am?”\n“Yes, very handsome.”\n“I am sure I know none so handsome; but in the gallery upstairs you will see a finer, larger picture of him than this.

He was very fond of them.”\nThis accounted to Elizabeth for Mr. Wickham’s being among them.\nMrs. Reynolds then directed their attention to one of Miss Darcy, drawn when she was only eight years old.\n“And is Miss Darcy as handsome as her brother?” said Mr. Gardiner.\n“Oh, yes—the handsomest young lady that ever was seen; and so accomplished! She plays and sings all day long. In the next room is a new instrument just come down for her—a present from my master: she comes here to-morrow with him.”\nMr. Gardiner, whose manners were easy and pleasant, encouraged her communicativeness by his questions and remarks: Mrs. Reynolds, either from pride or attachment, had evidently great pleasure in talking of her master and his sister.\n“Is your master much at Pemberley in the course of the year?”\n“Not so much as I could wish, sir: but I dare say he may spend half his time here; and Miss Darcy is always down for the summer months.”\n“Except,” thought Elizabeth, “when she goes to Ramsgate.”\n“If your master would marry, you might see more of him.”\n“Yes, sir; but I do not know when that will be. I do not know who is good enough for him.”\nMr. and Mrs. Gardiner smiled. Elizabeth could not help saying, “It is very much to his credit, I am sure, that you should think so.”\n“I say no more than the truth, and what everybody will say that knows him,” replied the other. Elizabeth thought this was going pretty far; and she listened with increasing astonishment as the housekeeper added, “I have never had a cross word from him in my life, and I have known him ever since he was four years old.”\nThis was praise of all others most extraordinary, most opposite to her ideas. That he was not a good-tempered man had been her firmest opinion. Her keenest attention was awakened: she longed to hear more; and was grateful to her uncle for saying,—\n“There are very few people of whom so much can be said. You are lucky in having such a master.”\n“Yes, sir, I know I am. If I were to go through the world, I could not meet with a better. But I have always observed, that they who are good-natured when children, are good-natured when they grow up; and he was always the sweetest tempered, most generous-hearted boy in the world.”\nElizabeth almost stared at her. “Can this be Mr. Darcy?” thought she.\n“His father was an excellent man,” said Mrs. Gardiner.\n“Yes, ma’am, that he was indeed; and his son will be just like him—just as affable to the poor.”\nElizabeth listened, wondered, doubted, and was impatient for more. Mrs. Reynolds could interest her on no other point. She related the subjects of the pictures, the dimensions of the rooms, and the price of the furniture in vain. Mr. Gardiner, highly amused by the kind of family prejudice, to which he attributed her excessive commendation of her master, soon led again to the subject; and she dwelt with energy on his many merits, as they proceeded together up the great staircase.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "Elizabeth really wanted to ask the housekeeper if Mr. Darcy was away, but she didn't have the courage. Eventually, her uncle asked the question for her. Elizabeth turned away nervously as Mrs. Reynolds confirmed he was absent, adding, \"But we expect him tomorrow with a large group of friends.\" Elizabeth was incredibly relieved that their own travel plans hadn't been delayed by even a day.\nHer aunt then called her attention to a painting. She walked over and saw a miniature of Mr. Wickham hanging with several others above the fireplace. Her aunt smiled and asked what she thought of it. The housekeeper stepped forward and explained it was a portrait of a young gentleman, the son of her late master's steward, whom the master had supported financially. \"He's joined the army now,\" she added, \"but I'm afraid he's turned out quite wild.\"\nMrs. Gardiner smiled at her niece, but Elizabeth couldn't return the smile.\n\"And that,\" said Mrs. Reynolds, pointing to another miniature, \"is my master—and it looks very much like him. It was painted at the same time as the other—about eight years ago.\"\n\"I've heard a lot about your master's handsome appearance,\" said Mrs. Gardiner, looking at the painting; \"it is indeed a good-looking face. But, Lizzy, you can tell us whether it's a good likeness or not.\"\nMrs. Reynolds' respect for Elizabeth seemed to grow upon hearing that she knew her master.\n\"Does that young lady know Mr. Darcy?\"\nElizabeth blushed and replied, \"A little.\"\n\"And don't you think he's a very handsome gentleman, madam?\"\n\"Yes, very handsome.\"\n\"I'm sure I don't know anyone else as handsome; but upstairs in the gallery, you'll see a better, larger picture of him than this one. This room was my late master's favorite, and these miniatures are exactly as they always were. He was very fond of them.\"\nThis explained to Elizabeth why Mr. Wickham's portrait was among them.\nMrs. Reynolds then showed them a miniature of Miss Darcy, painted when she was just eight years old.\n\"And is Miss Darcy as handsome as her brother?\" asked Mr. Gardiner.\n\"Oh, yes—the most beautiful young lady one could ever see; and so talented! She plays music and sings constantly. In the next room, there's a new instrument that just arrived for her—a gift from my master: she's coming here tomorrow with him.\"\nMr. Gardiner, who had an easy and pleasant manner, encouraged her talkativeness with his questions and comments. Mrs. Reynolds, seemingly out of either pride or affection, clearly enjoyed discussing her master and his sister.\n\"Is your master here at Pemberley often throughout the year?\"\n\"Not as much as I'd like, sir; but I would guess he spends half his time here; and Miss Darcy is always here for the summer months.\"\n\"Except,\" Elizabeth thought to herself, \"when she goes to Ramsgate.\"\n\"If your master were to marry, you might see him more often.\"\n\"Yes, sir; but I don't know when that will happen. I don't know who would be good enough for him.\"\nMr. and Mrs. Gardiner exchanged smiles. Elizabeth couldn't resist saying, \"It certainly speaks well of him, I'm sure, that you think so highly.\"\n\"I'm simply telling the truth, and it's what anyone who knows him will say,\" the housekeeper replied. Elizabeth thought this was quite a strong statement, and she listened with increasing astonishment as Mrs. Reynolds added, \"He's never said a harsh word to me in my life, and I've known him since he was four years old.\"\nThis praise was the most extraordinary she had ever heard, completely contradicting her own views. That he lacked a good temper had been her firm belief. Her attention was fully captured; she was eager to hear more and was grateful to her uncle for saying,\n\"Very few people can have such wonderful things said about them. You are fortunate to have such a master.\"\n\"Yes, sir, I know I am. If I traveled the world, I couldn't find a better one. But I've always noticed that those who are kind-natured as children remain kind-natured as adults; and he was always the sweetest-tempered, most generous-hearted boy in the world.\"\nElizabeth was almost speechless, staring at her. \"Can this really be Mr. Darcy?\" she wondered.\n\"His father was an excellent man,\" said Mrs. Gardiner.\n\"Yes, madam, he truly was; and his son will be just like him—just as kind to the poor.\"\nElizabeth listened, marveling, doubting, and eager for more information. Mrs. Reynolds couldn't capture her interest on any other topic. She described the subjects of other paintings, the sizes of the rooms, and the cost of the furniture, but Elizabeth paid little attention. Mr. Gardiner, highly entertained by what he saw as a kind of family bias contributing to her excessive praise of her master, soon steered the conversation back to Darcy; and as they continued up the grand staircase together, she spoke with great enthusiasm about his many good qualities.",

Eventually, her uncle posed the question, and while Elizabeth turned away anxiously, Mrs. Reynolds confirmed that he was indeed gone but would return the next day with a group of friends. Elizabeth was very relieved that their visit had not been postponed even a day. Her aunt then called her over to see a portrait, which turned out to be of Mr. Wickham, displayed among other miniatures above the fireplace. Smiling, her aunt asked what she thought of it. The housekeeper explained it was of a young man, her late master's steward's son, who had been raised at her master's expense and was now in the army, but unfortunately had become wild. Mrs. Gardiner smiled at Elizabeth, who couldn’t manage a smile in return. Mrs. Reynolds pointed to another portrait—the master himself—and said it was very like him, drawn about eight years prior. Mrs. Gardiner commented on the handsomeness of Mr. Darcy in the picture and asked Elizabeth if it was a good likeness. Mrs. Reynolds seemed to respect Elizabeth more, realizing she knew Mr. Darcy. When asked, Elizabeth blushed and said she knew him a little, and confirmed that he was very handsome. Mrs. Reynolds declared she knew none as handsome and mentioned an even better portrait upstairs. She explained this room was her late master’s favorite and the pictures remained as he’d left them, which explained Wickham’s presence among the portraits. Mrs. Reynolds then showed them a picture of Miss Darcy as a child. Mr. Gardiner asked if she was as attractive as her brother, and Mrs. Reynolds enthusiastically praised her beauty and accomplishments, mentioning the new instrument her master had just purchased for her and saying she and Mr. Darcy would return the following day. Mr. Gardiner, being friendly, encouraged Mrs. Reynolds to share more, and she clearly took pride in talking about her master and Miss Darcy. She explained that Mr. Darcy spent about half the year at Pemberley, though she wished it were more, and that Miss Darcy stayed in the summer. Elizabeth recalled this didn’t include trips like Miss Darcy’s to Ramsgate. Mr. Gardiner suggested that Mrs. Reynolds might see more of her master if he married, but Mrs. Reynolds replied she didn’t know who would be worthy. Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner smiled, and Elizabeth remarked how telling it was that she thought so highly of him. Mrs. Reynolds insisted she was only being truthful, and everyone who knew Mr. Darcy would say the same, adding that she’d never heard a harsh word from him since he was a child. This surprised Elizabeth, as it contradicted her belief that he had a poor temper. She was eager to listen further, grateful her uncle prompted Mrs. Reynolds to continue. Mrs. Reynolds repeated that she could not hope for a better master and believed people who are kind as children remain so as adults, describing Darcy as always sweet-natured and generous. Elizabeth could barely believe it was the same Mr. Darcy. Mrs. Gardiner commented that Mr. Darcy's father was also a very good man, and Mrs. Reynolds agreed, adding that Mr. Darcy was just as kind to the poor. Elizabeth listened with a mix of curiosity and skepticism, wanting to hear more. Other topics, such as the rooms and their furnishings, could not hold her interest, and Mr. Gardiner, amused by what he saw as Mrs. Reynolds’s family prejudice, steered the conversation back to Mr. Darcy, to which Mrs. Reynolds responded with energetic praise of her master's many virtues as they moved through the house."

There is not one of his tenants or servants but what will give him a good name. Some people call him proud; but I am sure I never saw anything of it. To my fancy, it is only because he does not rattle away like other young men.”\n“In what an amiable light does this place him!” thought Elizabeth.\n“This fine account of him,” whispered her aunt as they walked, “is not quite consistent with his behaviour to our poor friend.”\n“Perhaps we might be deceived.”\n“That is not very likely; our authority was too good.”\nOn reaching the spacious lobby above, they were shown into a very pretty sitting-room, lately fitted up with greater elegance and lightness than the apartments below; and were informed that it was but just done to give pleasure to Miss Darcy, who had taken a liking to the room, when last at Pemberley.\n“He is certainly a good brother,” said Elizabeth, as she walked towards one of the windows.\nMrs. Reynolds anticipated Miss Darcy’s delight, when she should enter the room. “And this is always the way with him,” she added. “Whatever can give his sister any pleasure, is sure to be done in a moment. There is nothing he would not do for her.”\nThe picture gallery, and two or three of the principal bed-rooms, were all that remained to be shown. In the former were many good paintings: but Elizabeth knew nothing of the art; and from such as had been already visible below, she had willingly turned to look at some drawings of Miss Darcy’s, in crayons, whose subjects were usually more interesting, and also more intelligible.\nIn the gallery there were many family portraits, but they could have little to fix the attention of a stranger. Elizabeth walked on in quest of the only face whose features would be known to her. At last it arrested her—and she beheld a striking resemblance of Mr. Darcy, with such a smile over the face, as she remembered to have sometimes seen, when he looked at her. She stood several minutes before the picture, in earnest contemplation, and returned to it again before they quitted the gallery. Mrs. Reynolds informed them, that it had been taken in his father’s lifetime.\nThere was certainly at this moment, in Elizabeth’s mind, a more gentle sensation towards the original than she had ever felt in the height of their acquaintance. The commendation bestowed on him by Mrs. Reynolds was of no trifling nature. What praise is more valuable than the praise of an intelligent servant? As a brother, a landlord, a master, she considered how many people’s happiness were in his guardianship! How much of pleasure or pain it was in his power to bestow! How much of good or evil must be done by him! Every idea that had been brought forward by the housekeeper was favourable to his character; and as she stood before the canvas, on which he was represented, and fixed his eyes upon herself, she thought of his regard with a deeper sentiment of gratitude than it had ever raised before: she remembered its warmth, and softened its impropriety of expression.\n",

She stated that all his tenants and staff spoke highly of him. Some people called him proud, but she had never witnessed this, believing it was simply because he wasn't as outgoing as other young men. Elizabeth found this description of him very appealing. As they walked, her aunt quietly remarked that this glowing account didn't quite match his actions towards their unfortunate friend. Elizabeth suggested they might be mistaken. Her aunt dismissed this possibility, confident in the reliability of their source. After reaching the spacious upper landing, they were led into a very attractive sitting-room, recently redecorated to be lighter and more elegant than the lower rooms. They were told this work had just been completed to please Miss Darcy, who had grown fond of the room during her previous visit to Pemberley. \"He's clearly a kind brother,\" Elizabeth commented as she moved towards a window. Mrs. Reynolds anticipated Miss Darcy's delight upon entering the room. \"That's just how he is,\" she added. \"Whatever brings his sister joy is done instantly. There's nothing he wouldn't do for her.\" The picture gallery and a few main bedrooms were all that remained to be shown. The gallery contained many good paintings, but Elizabeth wasn't knowledgeable about art. She had earlier preferred looking at Miss Darcy's crayon drawings downstairs, finding their subjects generally more interesting and easier to understand. Among the family portraits in the gallery, which held little interest for a visitor, Elizabeth searched for the one face she would recognize. Finally, her attention was caught by it—a striking likeness of Mr. Darcy, wearing a smile similar to one she remembered seeing directed at her on occasion. She stood thoughtfully before the portrait for several minutes and returned to it again before they left the gallery. Mrs. Reynolds mentioned it had been painted during his father's lifetime. At that moment, Elizabeth certainly felt a gentler sentiment towards him than she had ever experienced at the peak of their acquaintance. The praise given by Mrs. Reynolds was highly significant. What recommendation is more valuable than that from an intelligent servant? She contemplated his roles as a brother, landlord, and master, considering how much control he had over the happiness of many people! How much joy or sorrow he had the power to cause! How much good or bad he must influence! Every point raised by the housekeeper was positive for his character, and as she stood before the canvas depicting him, feeling his painted gaze upon her, she thought of his regard for her with a deeper feeling of gratitude than it had ever evoked before; she recalled its warmth and softened her previous interpretation of its awkward expression.",

As they walked, Elizabeth's aunt quietly remarked, \"This glowing praise doesn’t fully match how he acted towards our unfortunate friend.\" Elizabeth replied, \"Perhaps we've been misled.\" Her aunt was doubtful, insisting their previous source was too reliable to be wrong. When they reached the large upper landing, they were taken into a charming, newly redecorated sitting room, made especially to please Miss Darcy, who had recently shown a fondness for it during a visit. Elizabeth noted how devoted Mr. Darcy was as a brother, and Mrs. Reynolds eagerly anticipated Miss Darcy’s delight at seeing the room. She added, \"He always acts quickly to make his sister happy; there’s nothing he wouldn’t do for her.\" The only rooms left to see were the portrait gallery and a few important bedrooms.

Eventually, she found a striking likeness of Mr. Darcy, whose expression bore the same smile she had occasionally seen when he looked at her. She spent several minutes studying the painting and even returned to it before leaving the gallery. Mrs. Reynolds told them the portrait had been painted while Mr. Darcy’s father was still alive. At this moment, Elizabeth felt more kindly towards Mr. Darcy than she ever had during their acquaintance. The high praise the housekeeper gave him carried significant weight, especially as it came from someone observant. Elizabeth considered how, as brother, landlord, and master, Darcy had many people’s wellbeing in his hands and how much good or harm he could do them. Every account from Mrs. Reynolds improved her opinion of him, and as she looked at his portrait, she reflected on his feelings for her with more gratitude than she had ever felt, recalling his passion and viewing it more charitably than before."

Bidding farewell to the housekeeper, they were then entrusted to the care of the gardener, who greeted them at the main entrance.

While her uncle speculated about the age of the structure, the gentleman who owned the estate suddenly emerged from the path behind the building that led to the stables.

She had reflexively turned away but stopped as he approached, accepting his pleasantries with an embarrassment she could not control.

Elizabeth instinctively turned away but stopped herself as he came near, receiving his greetings with an awkwardness she could not hide. Even if his appearance or likeness to the portrait they had just seen hadn't been enough to identify him as Mr. Darcy for her relatives, the surprised reaction of the gardener on seeing his master would have made it clear. Elizabeth's uncle and aunt stood back while Mr. Darcy spoke to Elizabeth, who, amazed and unsettled, barely dared to look at him and was unsure of her responses to his polite questions about her family. She was astonished by how much his demeanor had changed since they last met, and everything he said only made her more embarrassed, reminding her of how improper her visit must seem. The short time they spent together was among the most uncomfortable of her life. Mr. Darcy didn't seem much more at easy; his voice lacked its usual calmness, and he repeatedly and awkwardly asked about when she had left Longbourn and how long she intended to stay in Derbyshire, clearly showing he was distracted.

She was overpowered by shame and vexation. Her coming there was the most unfortunate, the most ill-judged thing in the world! How strange must it appear to him! In what a disgraceful light might it not strike so vain a man! It might seem as if she had purposely thrown herself in his way again! Oh! why did she come? or, why did he thus come a day before he was expected? Had they been only ten minutes sooner, they should have been beyond the reach of his discrimination; for it was plain that he was that moment arrived, that moment alighted from his horse or his carriage. She blushed again and again over the perverseness of the meeting. And his behaviour, so strikingly altered,—what could it mean? That he should even speak to her was amazing!—but to speak with such civility, to inquire after her family! Never in her life had she seen his manners so little dignified, never had he spoken with such gentleness as on this unexpected meeting. What a contrast did it offer to his last address in Rosings Park, when he put his letter into her hand! She knew not what to think, or how to account for it.\nThey had now entered a beautiful walk by the side of the water, and every step was bringing forward a nobler fall of ground, or a finer reach of the woods to which they were approaching: but it was some time before Elizabeth was sensible of any of it; and, though she answered mechanically to the repeated appeals of her uncle and aunt, and seemed to direct her eyes to such objects as they pointed out, she distinguished no part of the scene. Her thoughts were all fixed on that one spot of Pemberley House, whichever it might be, where Mr. Darcy then was. She longed to know what at that moment was passing in his mind; in what manner he thought of her, and whether, in defiance of everything, she was still dear to him. Perhaps he had been civil only because he felt himself at ease; yet there had been that in his voice, which was not like ease. Whether he had felt more of pain or of pleasure in seeing her, she could not tell, but he certainly had not seen her with composure.\nAt length, however, the remarks of her companions on her absence of mind roused her, and she felt the necessity of appearing more like herself.",

She was overcome by embarrassment and annoyance. Her coming there was the most unfortunate, the most poorly judged decision she could have made! How strange it must seem to him! How negatively might such a proud man interpret it! It could appear as though she had deliberately put herself in his path again! Oh, why had she come? Or why had he arrived a day earlier than expected? If they had been just ten minutes sooner, they would have been out of his sight; it was obvious he had just arrived, having just dismounted from his horse or carriage. She blushed repeatedly at the awkwardness of the meeting. And his behaviour, so remarkably changed—what could it mean? The fact that he even spoke to her was astonishing! But to speak with such politeness, to ask about her family! Never in her life had she seen his manners so unassuming, nor had he ever spoken with such gentleness as at this unexpected encounter. What a stark contrast it was to his last words at Rosings Park, when he handed her his letter! She was at a loss as to what to think or how to explain it. They had now entered a beautiful path by the water's edge, and each step revealed a grander slope or a more picturesque part of the woods they were approaching; but it was some time before Elizabeth became aware of any of it. Although she responded automatically to her uncle and aunt's repeated comments and seemed to look at the things they pointed out, she did not truly notice any of the scenery. Her thoughts were entirely fixed on that specific place within Pemberley House, wherever it might be, where Mr. Darcy was at that moment. She desperately wanted to know what was going through his mind right then; how he regarded her, and whether, despite everything, she was still dear to him. Perhaps he had been civil merely because he felt comfortable in his own surroundings; yet, there had been something in his voice that didn't suggest comfort. She couldn't tell if seeing her caused him more pain or pleasure, but he certainly had not seemed indifferent. Finally, however, her companions' remarks about her distraction brought her back to the present, and she felt she must make an effort to appear more like her usual self.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "The others soon joined Elizabeth and commented on how handsome Mr. Darcy looked. But Elizabeth was so caught up in her emotions that she didn't hear any of it and walked with them silently, overwhelmed by embarrassment and annoyance. She thought it was extremely unlucky and ill-advised for her to have come there—it must seem so odd to him. He might think, being so proud, that she had intentionally sought him out again. She wondered why she had come at all, or why he had arrived a day earlier than expected. If they had just arrived ten minutes earlier themselves, they would have missed him entirely; it was clear he had just arrived himself. She blushed repeatedly at the awkwardness of their unexpected encounter. She couldn't understand his behavior either—it was so different than before. The mere fact that he spoke to her was surprising, but the way he did so—with courtesy and real interest in her family—astonished her. She had never seen him so lacking in pride or heard him speak so kindly, especially not when she last saw him at Rosings Park, handing her his letter. Now, she had no idea what to make of everything or how to explain his change in attitude.\n\nThey now walked along a lovely path beside the water, taking in increasingly beautiful views of the landscape, but it took a while before Elizabeth became aware of any of it. Though she answered automatically to her uncle and aunt as they pointed things out, she wasn't really seeing anything. All she could think about was where in Pemberley House Mr. Darcy might be at that moment, and what he must be feeling or thinking about her—if she still meant anything to him, despite everything. Maybe his friendliness was simply because he felt comfortable at home, though there was something in his tone that suggested otherwise. She couldn't tell if seeing her had pleased or pained him, but one thing was certain—he was not indifferent.\n\nEventually, her relatives noticed her distraction, and their comments made her realize she needed to act more like herself."

Mr. Gardiner expressed a wish of going round the whole park, but feared it might be beyond a walk. With a triumphant smile, they were told, that it was ten miles round. It settled the matter; and they pursued the accustomed circuit; which brought them again, after some time, in a descent among hanging woods, to the edge of the water, and one of its narrowest parts. They crossed it by a simple bridge, in character with the general air of the scene: it was a spot less adorned than any they had yet visited; and the valley, here contracted into a glen, allowed room only for the stream, and a narrow walk amidst the rough coppice-wood which bordered it. Elizabeth longed to explore its windings; but when they had crossed the bridge, and perceived their distance from the house, Mrs. Gardiner, who was not a great walker, could go no farther, and thought only of returning to the carriage as quickly as possible. Her niece was, therefore, obliged to submit, and they took their way towards the house on the opposite side of the river, in the nearest direction; but their progress was slow, for Mr. Gardiner, though seldom able to indulge the taste, was very fond of fishing, and was so much engaged in watching the occasional appearance of some trout in the water, and talking to the man about them, that he advanced but little. Whilst wandering on in this slow manner, they were again surprised, and Elizabeth’s astonishment was quite equal to what it had been at first, by the sight of Mr. Darcy approaching them, and at no great distance. The walk being here less sheltered than on the other side, allowed them to see him before they met. Elizabeth, however astonished, was at least more prepared for an interview than before, and resolved to appear and to speak with calmness, if he really intended to meet them. For a few moments, indeed, she felt that he would probably strike into some other path. The idea lasted while a turning in the walk concealed him from their view; the turning past, he was immediately before them. With a glance she saw that he had lost none of his recent civility; and, to imitate his politeness, she began as they met to admire the beauty of the place; but she had not got beyond the words “delightful,” and “charming,” when some unlucky recollections obtruded, and she fancied that praise of Pemberley from her might be mischievously construed. Her colour changed, and she said no more.\nMrs. Gardiner was standing a little behind; and on her pausing, he asked her if she would do him the honour of introducing him to her friends. This was a stroke of civility for which she was quite unprepared; and she could hardly suppress a smile at his being now seeking the acquaintance of some of those very people, against whom his pride had revolted, in his offer to herself. “What will be his surprise,” thought she, “when he knows who they are! He takes them now for people of fashion.”\nThe introduction, however, was immediately made; and as she named their relationship to herself, she stole a sly look at him, to see how he bore it; and was not without the expectation of his decamping as fast as he could from such disgraceful companions. That he was surprised by the connection was evident: he sustained it, however, with fortitude: and, so far from going away, turned back with them, and entered into conversation with Mr. Gardiner. Elizabeth could not but be pleased, could not but triumph. It was consoling that he should know she had some relations for whom there was no need to blush. She listened most attentively to all that passed between them, and gloried in every expression, every sentence of her uncle, which marked his intelligence, his taste, or his good manners.\nThe conversation soon turned upon fishing; and she heard Mr. Darcy invite him, with the greatest civility, to fish there as often as he chose, while he continued in the neighbourhood, offering at the same time to supply him with fishing tackle, and pointing out those parts of the stream where there was usually most sport. Mrs. Gardiner, who was walking arm in arm with Elizabeth, gave her a look expressive of her wonder. Elizabeth said nothing, but it gratified her exceedingly; the compliment must be all for herself. Her astonishment, however, was extreme; and continually was she repeating, “Why is he so altered? From what can it proceed? It cannot be for me, it cannot be for my sake that his manners are thus softened. My reproofs at Hunsford could not work such a change as this. It is impossible that he should still love me.”",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "They walked into the woods, leaving the river behind briefly to climb to higher areas. From these vantage points, wherever the trees opened up enough to see, there were many lovely sights of the valley below, the hills opposite, covered by extensive woods, and sometimes a glimpse of the river. Mr. Gardiner mentioned wanting to see the whole park but worried it was too far to walk. They were told with a confident smile that the circuit was ten miles, which settled the matter. They then followed the usual path, which eventually led them downhill through overhanging woods back to the riverbank, specifically one of its narrower points. They crossed using a simple bridge that fit the natural feel of the place; this area was less decorative than others they had seen. Here, the valley narrowed into a small gorge, with just enough space for the stream and a narrow path running alongside the dense undergrowth lining it. Elizabeth wanted to explore the winding path, but after crossing the bridge and realizing how far they were from the house, Mrs. Gardiner, who wasn't a keen walker, felt she couldn't go further and only wanted to get back to the carriage quickly. Elizabeth had to agree, and they headed towards the house on the other side of the river by the shortest route. However, their progress was slow because Mr. Gardiner, who loved fishing even though he rarely got to do it, was engrossed in watching for trout and talking to the man with them about the fish, moving very slowly. While walking slowly like this, they were once again surprised, and Elizabeth was just as astonished as before, to see Mr. Darcy approaching them not far away. The path here was less covered by trees than on the other side, allowing them to spot him before they met. Despite her surprise, Elizabeth felt more prepared to meet him this time and decided to act and speak calmly if he did approach them. For a moment, she thought he might turn onto a different path. This thought lasted while a bend in the path hid him, but once they rounded the bend, he was right in front of them. She quickly saw that he was still as polite as he had been recently, and to match his politeness, she began to compliment the beauty of the location as they met. But she had barely said \"delightful\" and \"charming\" when some unwelcome thoughts popped into her head, making her think that praising Pemberley might be misinterpreted coming from her. She blushed and stopped speaking. Mrs. Gardiner was slightly behind her, and when Elizabeth paused, Mr. Darcy asked her if she would be kind enough to introduce him to her companions. This was a surprisingly polite move that caught her off guard, and she could hardly help smiling at the thought of him now wanting to meet the very people against whom his pride had rebelled when he proposed to her. \"How surprised he'll be,\" she thought, \"when he learns who they are! He must think they're fashionable people now.\" The introduction happened right away. As she stated their relationship to her, she quickly glanced at him to see his reaction, half expecting him to hurry away from such supposedly embarrassing relatives. His surprise at the connection was clear, but he handled it well. Far from leaving, he turned back and walked with them, starting a conversation with Mr. Gardiner. Elizabeth couldn't help but be pleased and feel a sense of victory. It was satisfying that he would see she had relatives she didn't need to be ashamed of. She listened intently to their conversation, taking pride in every word her uncle spoke that showed his intelligence, good taste, or polite manners. The conversation soon shifted to fishing, and she heard Mr. Darcy very politely invite Mr. Gardiner to fish there whenever he liked while he was in the area. He also offered to provide fishing gear and pointed out the best spots in the stream. Mrs. Gardiner, walking arm-in-arm with Elizabeth, gave her a look expressing her astonishment. Elizabeth didn't say anything, but she was incredibly pleased; this politeness must be directed at her. Her astonishment, however, was immense, and she kept asking herself, \"Why has he changed so much? What could be the reason? It can't be for me, not for my sake, that his manners are so gentle now. My criticisms at Hunsford couldn't have caused such a change. It's impossible that he still loves me.\"",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "They made their way into the woods, leaving the riverside for a while as they climbed to higher ground. From certain spots where the trees parted, they enjoyed lovely views over the valley, hills, and stretches of woods, sometimes catching glimpses of the river below. Mr. Gardiner suggested they walk all the way around the estate, but, upon learning it was a ten-mile circuit, they settled for the usual path instead. The trail eventually led them back downhill through dense woodlands to a narrow part of the stream, which they crossed on a simple, rustic bridge. This area was less manicured than others they’d seen, and the valley was so tight it allowed only for the stream and a narrow footpath among the wild woods. Elizabeth wished to explore more, but after crossing the bridge and realizing how far they were from the house, Mrs. Gardiner decided she could go no further and wanted to return to their carriage. Elizabeth had to comply, and they set off for the house on the far side of the river. Their return was slow, since Mr. Gardiner, who loved fishing though he seldom had the chance, became absorbed in watching the trout and chatting about them, hardly moving forward. As they ambled at this leisurely pace, they were suddenly surprised—Elizabeth just as much as the first time—to see Mr. Darcy coming toward them, not far off. The path here was more open, so they saw him before they met. Though shocked, Elizabeth was more composed than before and determined to greet him politely if he approached. For a moment, she thought he might turn down another path, but after briefly disappearing around a corner, he reappeared right in front of them. Quickly, she noticed he remained just as courteous as during their recent encounter, and to match his manners, she began admiring the beauty of the place—but stopped short, feeling self-conscious that her praise of Pemberley might be misunderstood, and blushed in embarrassment.\n\nMrs. Gardiner was slightly behind, and when Elizabeth paused, Mr. Darcy asked if she would be so kind as to introduce him to her friends. Elizabeth was caught off guard by such politeness, finding it amusing that he now sought acquaintance with the very people his pride made him reject when proposing to her. She wondered how surprised he’d be when he learned who they were, since he seemed to think they were people of high standing. The introductions were made, and as Elizabeth mentioned their relation to her, she watched his reaction, half expecting him to leave them in embarrassment. Though clearly surprised, Mr. Darcy stayed calm, and instead of leaving, he walked back with them, engaging Mr. Gardiner in conversation. Elizabeth was delighted and felt proud; it pleased her that he could see she had relations worthy of respect. She listened closely to every word, proud of her uncle’s intelligence, taste, and manners.\n\nSoon, the conversation focused on fishing, and Mr. Darcy kindly invited Mr. Gardiner to fish whenever he wished, even offering to lend tackle and showing him the best spots. Mrs. Gardiner, walking with Elizabeth, exchanged a look of amazement. Elizabeth said nothing, but was deeply gratified by Mr. Darcy’s kindness, which she felt must be meant for her. Yet she was very surprised, repeatedly asking herself why his manner had changed so much. She found it hard to believe it could be because of her—she doubted her past criticism had caused this transformation and could not imagine that he still cared for her."

It originated in Mrs. Gardiner, who, fatigued by the exercise of the morning, found Elizabeth’s arm inadequate to her support, and consequently preferred her husband’s. Mr. Darcy took her place by her niece, and they walked on together. After a short silence the lady first spoke. She wished him to know that she had been assured of his absence before she came to the place, and accordingly began by observing, that his arrival had been very unexpected—“for your housekeeper,” she added, “informed us that you would certainly not be here till to-morrow; and, indeed, before we left Bakewell, we understood that you were not immediately expected in the country.” He acknowledged the truth of it all; and said that business with his steward had occasioned his coming forward a few hours before the rest of the party with whom he had been travelling. “They will join me early to-morrow,” he continued, “and among them are some who will claim an acquaintance with you,—Mr. Bingley and his sisters.”\nElizabeth answered only by a slight bow. Her thoughts were instantly driven back to the time when Mr. Bingley’s name had been last mentioned between them; and if she might judge from his complexion, his mind was not very differently engaged.\n“There is also one other person in the party,” he continued after a pause, “who more particularly wishes to be known to you. Will you allow me, or do I ask too much, to introduce my sister to your acquaintance during your stay at Lambton?”\nThe surprise of such an application was great indeed; it was too great for her to know in what manner she acceded to it. She immediately felt that whatever desire Miss Darcy might have of being acquainted with her, must be the work of her brother, and without looking farther, it was satisfactory; it was gratifying to know that his resentment had not made him think really ill of her.\nThey now walked on in silence; each of them deep in thought. Elizabeth was not comfortable; that was impossible; but she was flattered and pleased. His wish of introducing his sister to her was a compliment of the highest kind. They soon outstripped the others; and when they had reached the carriage, Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner were half a quarter of a mile behind.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "After walking for a while, with the ladies in front and the gentlemen behind, the group stopped to go down to the riverbank for a closer look at an interesting water-plant. Upon resuming their walk, a slight change occurred. This was initiated by Mrs. Gardiner, who, feeling tired from the morning's walk, found Elizabeth's arm insufficient for support and consequently chose to walk with her husband instead. Mr. Darcy then took Mrs. Gardiner's former position and walked alongside Elizabeth. Following a brief silence, Elizabeth spoke first. She wished him to understand that she had been told he would be away before she arrived at the location, and so began by remarking that his presence was quite unexpected. She explained that his housekeeper had informed them he certainly wouldn't be there until the next day, and before they left Bakewell, they had understood he wasn't expected in the area immediately. He confirmed the accuracy of this, stating that business with his steward had caused him to come ahead a few hours before the rest of his travelling party. He continued, saying they would join him early the next day, and among them were people she was acquainted with, specifically Mr. Bingley and his sisters. Elizabeth responded only with a slight inclination of her head. Her thoughts were instantly drawn back to the last time Mr. Bingley's name was mentioned between them, and judging by his expression, his thoughts were similarly occupied. After a pause, he went on to say that there was one other person in his party who particularly wished to meet her. He asked if he might be permitted to introduce his sister to her acquaintance during her stay at Lambton, wondering if this request was too much. The surprise at such a proposal was indeed great, too great for her to immediately know how to accept. She instantly felt that any desire Miss Darcy had to meet her must be a result of her brother's doing, and without thinking further, this was satisfying. It was gratifying to know that his past resentment had not caused him to truly think ill of her. They continued walking in silence, both deeply engrossed in their thoughts. Elizabeth did not feel entirely comfortable, which was impossible, but she was nonetheless flattered and pleased. His wish to introduce his sister to her was a compliment of the highest order.

Mrs. Gardiner, tired from the morning's activity, found Elizabeth’s support insufficient and opted to walk with Mr. Gardiner instead. This left Mr. Darcy to walk alongside Elizabeth. After a brief silence, Elizabeth spoke first. She explained that she had believed he would be away, mentioning that the housekeeper had told them he would not arrive until the next day, and others had said he was not expected in the country yet. Darcy confirmed that this was correct but said he had arrived earlier than his companions because of business with his steward. He added that his friends, including Mr. Bingley and his sisters, would join him the following morning and some would wish to reacquaint themselves with her.\n\nElizabeth replied only with a slight nod, her mind recalling the last time she and Darcy had spoken of Mr. Bingley. Judging by Darcy’s expression, he seemed to have similar thoughts.\n\nAfter a pause, Darcy added that there was another person present who wished especially to meet Elizabeth—his sister. He politely asked if he might introduce Miss Darcy to her while she was staying at Lambton, or if he was overstepping. Elizabeth was astonished by the request and wasn't sure how she agreed, but she felt pleased—confident that any wish of Miss Darcy to know her was encouraged by her brother. The request reassured her that Darcy did not hold ill feelings against her.\n\nThey continued their walk in silence, each lost in thought. Although Elizabeth was uneasy, she felt honored and happy, recognizing that being introduced to Darcy’s sister was a significant gesture. Eventually, they outpaced the others, and when they reached the carriage, Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner were still some distance behind."

At such a time much might have been said, and silence was very awkward. She wanted to talk, but there seemed an embargo on every subject. At last she recollected that she had been travelling, and they talked of Matlock and Dovedale with great perseverance. Yet time and her aunt moved slowly—and her patience and her ideas were nearly worn out before the tête-à-tête was over.\nOn Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner’s coming up they were all pressed to go into the house and take some refreshment; but this was declined, and they parted on each side with the utmost politeness. Mr. Darcy handed the ladies into the carriage; and when it drove off, Elizabeth saw him walking slowly towards the house.\nThe observations of her uncle and aunt now began; and each of them pronounced him to be infinitely superior to anything they had expected.\n“He is perfectly well-behaved, polite, and unassuming,” said her uncle.\n“There is something a little stately in him, to be sure,” replied her aunt; “but it is confined to his air, and is not unbecoming. I can now say with the housekeeper, that though some people may call him proud, I have seen nothing of it.”\n“I was never more surprised than by his behaviour to us. It was more than civil; it was really attentive; and there was no necessity for such attention. His acquaintance with Elizabeth was very trifling.”\n“To be sure, Lizzy,” said her aunt, “he is not so handsome as Wickham; or rather he has not Wickham’s countenance, for his features are perfectly good. But how came you to tell us that he was so disagreeable?”\nElizabeth excused herself as well as she could: said that she had liked him better when they met in Kent than before, and that she had never seen him so pleasant as this morning.\n“But perhaps he may be a little whimsical in his civilities,” replied her uncle. “Your great men often are; and therefore I shall not take him at his word about fishing, as he might change his mind another day, and warn me off his grounds.”\nElizabeth felt that they had entirely mistaken his character, but said nothing.\n“From what we have seen of him,” continued Mrs. Gardiner, “I really should not have thought that he could have behaved in so cruel a way by anybody as he has done by poor Wickham. He has not an ill-natured look. On the contrary, there is something pleasing about his mouth when he speaks. And there is something of dignity in his countenance, that would not give one an unfavourable idea of his heart. But, to be sure, the good lady who showed us the house did give him a most flaming character! I could hardly help laughing aloud sometimes. But he is a liberal master, I suppose, and that, in the eye of a servant, comprehends every virtue.”\nElizabeth here felt herself called on to say something in vindication of his behaviour to Wickham; and, therefore, gave them to understand, in as guarded a manner as she could, that by what she had heard from his relations in Kent, his actions were capable of a very different construction; and that his character was by no means so faulty, nor Wickham’s so amiable, as they had been considered in Hertfordshire. In confirmation of this, she related the particulars of all the pecuniary transactions in which they had been connected, without actually naming her authority, but stating it to be such as might be relied on.\nMrs. Gardiner was surprised and concerned: but as they were now approaching the scene of her former pleasures, every idea gave way to the charm of recollection; and she was too much engaged in pointing out to her husband all the interesting spots in its environs, to think of anything else. Fatigued as she had been by the morning’s walk, they had no sooner dined than she set off again in quest of her former acquaintance, and the evening was spent in the satisfactions of an intercourse renewed after many years’ discontinuance.\nThe occurrences of the day were too full of interest to leave Elizabeth much attention for any of these new friends; and she could do nothing but think, and think with wonder, of Mr. Darcy’s civility, and, above all, of his wishing her to be acquainted with his sister.",

It was a moment when much could have been said, and the quiet felt very uncomfortable. She wanted to speak, but it felt like every topic was off-limits. Eventually, she remembered her recent travels, and they discussed Matlock and Dovedale at length. However, time and her aunt's arrival felt very slow, and her patience and conversation topics were almost depleted before the private conversation ended.\n\nWhen Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner approached, they were urged to come into the house for refreshments, but they declined. They then parted ways very politely. Mr. Darcy helped the ladies into their carriage, and as it drove away, Elizabeth watched him walk slowly back towards the house.\n\nHer uncle and aunt immediately began to share their opinions. Both declared he was far better than they had expected.\n\n'He is completely well-behaved, polite, and modest,' her uncle commented.\n\n'He certainly has a somewhat formal manner,' her aunt responded, 'but it's just in his bearing and isn't unattractive. I can now agree with the housekeeper that although some people might call him proud, I saw no sign of it myself.'\n\n'I was never more astonished than by how he acted towards us. It was more than just civil; he was truly attentive, and there was no reason for him to be so. His acquaintance with Elizabeth was very limited.'\n\n'To be honest, Lizzy,' her aunt said, 'he isn't as handsome as Wickham, or perhaps his face doesn't have the same appeal as Wickham's, because his features are quite good. But why on earth did you tell us he was so unpleasant?'\n\nElizabeth defended herself as best she could, saying she had found him more agreeable when they met in Kent than before, and she had never seen him so pleasant as he was that morning.\n\n'But maybe he can be a bit unpredictable with his politeness,' her uncle suggested. 'Important men often are. So I won't rely on what he said about fishing, as he might change his mind later and forbid me from his land.'\n\nElizabeth felt they completely misunderstood his true character but chose not to say anything.\n\n'Based on what we've seen of him,' Mrs. Gardiner continued, 'I really wouldn't have believed he could have treated anyone as cruelly as he did poor Wickham. He doesn't look malicious. In fact, there's something pleasant about his mouth when he speaks. And there's a kind of dignity in his expression that wouldn't lead one to think poorly of his heart. But, admittedly, the nice lady who showed us the house gave him a terrible description! I could barely stop myself from laughing out loud sometimes. But I suppose he's a generous employer, and to a servant, that counts for every good quality.'\n\nElizabeth felt obliged to say something to defend his actions concerning Wickham. She therefore explained, as cautiously as possible, that based on what she had heard from his family members in Kent, his behaviour could be interpreted very differently, and his character was not nearly as flawed, nor Wickham's as likable, as they had been perceived in Hertfordshire. To support this, she recounted the specifics of all the financial dealings they had been involved in, without actually revealing her source, but stating it was someone reliable.\n\nMrs. Gardiner was surprised and concerned, but as they were now approaching the area of her earlier enjoyable experiences, all other thoughts gave way to the pleasure of remembering the past. She became completely absorbed in pointing out all the interesting places nearby to her husband, forgetting everything else. Despite being tired from the morning's walk, they had no sooner finished dinner than she was eager to find her old acquaintances again. The evening was spent happily reconnecting after many years apart.\n\nThe day's events were too compelling to allow Elizabeth to pay much attention to any of these new friends. She could only think, and think with astonishment, about Mr. Darcy's courteousness, and especially his desire for her to get to know his sister.",

Eventually, she remembered her recent travels, and they persevered in discussing Matlock and Dovedale. Still, time dragged, and her aunt took a long time to return; by the end of their private conversation, Elizabeth was running out of patience and ideas. When Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner returned, everyone was courteously invited inside for refreshments, which was politely declined, and they all parted with great civility. Mr. Darcy assisted the ladies into their carriage, and as they drove away, Elizabeth observed him slowly walking back towards the house.\n\nAt this point, Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner began to discuss Darcy, saying that he far exceeded their expectations. Her uncle commented on Darcy’s good manners and modesty, and her aunt agreed, observing that while he could appear a bit formal, it was only in his demeanor and not unpleasant. She added that although some thought him proud, she had seen no evidence of this. They were both surprised by how attentive and considerate Darcy had been, especially as he hardly knew Elizabeth. Her aunt remarked that Darcy wasn’t as handsome as Wickham, or rather, did not have Wickham’s style, though his features were good. She also wondered why Elizabeth had previously described him as disagreeable. Elizabeth defended herself, saying she had liked Darcy more in Kent than before, and that he had never been as pleasant as this morning. Her uncle suggested Darcy might just be somewhat eccentric and therefore not to take his invitations too literally, as he might change his mind. Elizabeth realized they misunderstood Darcy’s character, but kept quiet.\n\nMrs. Gardiner reflected that, based on what they’d seen, she could not imagine Darcy acting so ruthlessly towards anyone as he apparently had with Wickham. He did not look unkind—in fact, there was something pleasant about his expression when he spoke, and a dignified look that did not seem to indicate a bad heart. She noted that the housekeeper had spoken very highly of Darcy, possibly because he was a generous employer, which in a servant’s eyes encompassed every virtue.\n\nAt this, Elizabeth felt obliged to defend Darcy, and carefully explained that, based on what she had heard from his family in Kent, his actions could be viewed very differently, and that his character was not as flawed, nor Wickham’s as admirable, as people believed in Hertfordshire. To support this, she shared the details of the financial dealings between Darcy and Wickham, without revealing her source, yet indicating it was trustworthy. Mrs. Gardiner was surprised and concerned by this, but as they neared the place she had enjoyed in her youth, she turned her attention to pointing out all the features of the landscape to her husband. Despite being tired from the morning’s walk, Mrs. Gardiner, after an early dinner, set out again to visit old friends, spending the evening reconnecting.\n\nFor Elizabeth, the day’s events were so significant that she could think of little else, marveling at Darcy’s courteous behavior, and especially at his desire for her to meet his sister."

They had been walking about the place with some of their new friends, and were just returned to the inn to dress themselves for dining with the same family, when the sound of a carriage drew them to a window, and they saw a gentleman and lady in a curricle driving up the street. Elizabeth, immediately recognizing the livery, guessed what it meant, and imparted no small degree of surprise to her relations, by acquainting them with the honour which she expected. Her uncle and aunt were all amazement; and the embarrassment of her manner as she spoke, joined to the circumstance itself, and many of the circumstances of the preceding day, opened to them a new idea on the business. Nothing had ever suggested it before, but they now felt that there was no other way of accounting for such attentions from such a quarter than by supposing a partiality for their niece. While these newly-born notions were passing in their heads, the perturbation of Elizabeth’s feelings was every moment increasing. She was quite amazed at her own discomposure; but, amongst other causes of disquiet, she dreaded lest the partiality of the brother should have said too much in her favour; and, more than commonly anxious to please, she naturally suspected that every power of pleasing would fail her.\nShe retreated from the window, fearful of being seen; and as she walked up and down the room, endeavouring to compose herself, saw such looks of inquiring surprise in her uncle and aunt as made everything worse.",

They had been exploring the area with some new acquaintances and had just returned to the inn to prepare for dinner with the same group when the sound of a carriage drew them to the window. They observed a gentleman and lady in a two-wheeled carriage driving up the street. Elizabeth instantly identified the servants' uniforms and understood the significance, communicating a considerable degree of surprise to her family by informing them of the impending distinguished visit she foresaw. Her uncle and aunt were utterly astonished; and the awkwardness of her demeanor as she spoke, combined with the event itself and numerous occurrences from the previous day, suggested a new possibility regarding the situation. This idea had never occurred to them before, but they now felt it was the only logical explanation for such attention coming from that source, suggesting he held a special affection for their niece. While these recently formed thoughts occupied their minds, Elizabeth's emotional agitation intensified with each passing moment. She was quite taken aback by her own lack of composure; but among other sources of distress, she worried that her brother might have expressed his preference for her too strongly, and being unusually keen to make a good impression, she instinctively feared that all her efforts to be agreeable would fail. She withdrew from the window, apprehensive of being spotted; and as she paced the room, attempting to regain her composure, she noticed her uncle and aunt giving her such questioning, surprised looks that it only worsened her discomfort.",

From these observations, they soon became fully convinced that at least one of the pair knew what it felt like to be in love. They remained somewhat uncertain about the lady's feelings, but it was clearly evident that the gentleman was filled with admiration.\n\nFor her part, Elizabeth had multiple tasks. She wanted to understand the feelings of both her visitors, compose her own emotions, and make herself pleasant to everyone. In this last aim, where she most feared she might fail, she was most certain to succeed, because those she was trying to please were already favourably disposed towards her. Bingley was willing, Georgiana was eager, and Darcy was determined to be pleased.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "Soon after Darcy and Elizabeth were together, Darcy informed her that Bingley would also be arriving to visit. Elizabeth barely had time to express her happiness and get ready for Bingley's arrival before his energetic footsteps were heard on the stairs and he quickly joined them. Any resentment Elizabeth had ever felt toward Bingley had vanished long ago, but even if it remained, it would have been dispelled by his sincere friendliness upon greeting her. He asked after her family in a warm, albeit general manner, behaving with the same pleasant nature as always. To Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner, Bingley was almost as interesting a guest as he was to Elizabeth, as they had been eager to meet him. The entire group captured the Gardiners' attention, especially since they now suspected a possible attachment between Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth. They observed both individuals closely and, through their observations, became convinced that at least one of them had experienced love. They were less certain about Elizabeth’s feelings but were sure that Darcy was full of admiration. Elizabeth herself felt she had much to manage: she wanted to understand how each guest felt, to control her own emotions, and to make herself pleasant to everyone. In her efforts to be agreeable—where she most doubted her own success—she actually had the greatest advantage, because her guests were already well-disposed toward her; Bingley was willing, Georgiana was enthusiastic, and Darcy was determined to be pleased."

But, though this might be imaginary, she could not be deceived as to his behaviour to Miss Darcy, who had been set up as a rival to Jane. No look appeared on either side that spoke particular regard. Nothing occurred between them that could justify the hopes of his sister.

He observed to her, at a moment when the others were talking together, and in a tone which had something of real regret, that it “was a very long time since he had had the pleasure of seeing her;” and, before she could reply, he added, “It is above eight months. We have not met since the 26th of November, when we were all dancing together at Netherfield.”\nElizabeth was pleased to find his memory so exact; and he afterwards took occasion to ask her, when unattended to by any of the rest, whether all her sisters were at Longbourn.

However, while her own ideas about his thoughts might be imagined, she was certain about his interactions with Miss Darcy, who had been put forward as a competitor for his affection against Jane. Neither Bingley nor Miss Darcy showed any particular fondness for each other. Nothing happened between them that could support his sister's hopes for a match. Elizabeth was quickly convinced of this lack of connection. Before they departed, a few small events occurred which, in her hopeful view, indicated he remembered Jane, perhaps with some tender feeling, and wished to say more that might lead to mentioning her, if only he had dared. At a moment when the others were chatting, he told her with what sounded like true regret that it had been \"a very long time\" since he last had the pleasure of seeing her. Before she could reply, he added, \"It has been more than eight months. We haven't met since November 26th, when we were all dancing together at Netherfield.\" Elizabeth was glad his memory was so precise. Later, when no one else was paying attention, he took the opportunity to ask her if all her sisters were currently at Longbourn. The specific words of the question, or his earlier remark, weren't very significant on their own; but the look and manner with which he said them gave them importance.",

Even if this was just her imagination, she could clearly see there was nothing in his conduct toward Miss Darcy—which some had considered Jane's rival—to suggest any particular attachment. Their interactions provided no encouragement for his sister's hopes. Elizabeth was quickly reassured about this, and before they parted, a few small occurrences made her believe—based on her anxious interpretations—that Bingley was still thinking fondly of Jane, and perhaps wished to speak of her, if he dared. At one point, when the others were engaged elsewhere, he noted to Elizabeth in a genuinely regretful tone that it had been a very long time since he last saw her, and added, before she could respond, that it had been over eight months—they hadn't met since their dance at Netherfield on November 26th. Elizabeth was glad to see his memory was so precise; later, when no one else was paying attention, Bingley also inquired whether all her sisters were still at Longbourn.

She certainly did not hate him. No; hatred had vanished long ago, and she had almost as long been ashamed of ever feeling a dislike against him, that could be so called. The respect created by the conviction of his valuable qualities, though at first unwillingly admitted, had for some time ceased to be repugnant to her feelings; and it was now heightened into somewhat of a friendlier nature by the testimony so highly in his favour, and bringing forward his disposition in so amiable a light, which yesterday had produced. But above all, above respect and esteem, there was a motive within her of good-will which could not be overlooked. It was gratitude;—gratitude, not merely for having once loved her, but for loving her still well enough to forgive all the petulance and acrimony of her manner in rejecting him, and all the unjust accusations accompanying her rejection. He who, she had been persuaded, would avoid her as his greatest enemy, seemed, on this accidental meeting, most eager to preserve the acquaintance; and without any indelicate display of regard, or any peculiarity of manner, where their two selves only were concerned, was soliciting the good opinion of her friends, and bent on making her known to his sister. Such a change in a man of so much pride excited not only astonishment but gratitude—for to love, ardent love, it must be attributed; and, as such, its impression on her was of a sort to be encouraged, as by no means unpleasing, though it could not be exactly defined. She respected, she esteemed, she was grateful to him, she felt a real interest in his welfare; and she only wanted to know how far she wished that welfare to depend upon herself, and how far it would be for the happiness of both that she should employ the power, which her fancy told her she still possessed, of bringing on the renewal of his addresses.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "That evening, Elizabeth's thoughts were centered on Pemberley even more than the night before. The hours felt lengthy as they passed, yet were insufficient for her to clarify her feelings towards the gentleman who lived in that estate. She lay awake for two full hours, attempting to understand these emotions. She certainly didn't hate him; indeed, that feeling had vanished long ago, and she had been embarrassed for almost as long about ever feeling a strong dislike towards him. The respect she had developed upon recognizing his valuable qualities, initially accepted with reluctance, had for some time felt comfortable to her. This respect was now heightened into something resembling friendliness by the very favorable reports heard the previous day, which painted his character in such an appealing light. But beyond respect and esteem, there was a profound sense of good intentions within her that could not be overlooked. This was gratitude—gratitude not merely for his past love, but for his continued love being strong enough to forgive the rudeness and bitterness of her manner during her rejection, and the unjust accusations she had made. The man she had been convinced would avoid her as his greatest enemy seemed, during this chance encounter, extremely keen to maintain their acquaintance. Without any improper display of affection or peculiar behavior when they were alone, he was actively seeking the good opinion of her friends and was set on introducing her to his sister. Such a significant change in a man of so much pride aroused not only astonishment but also gratitude—for it had to be attributed to love, ardent love; and because of this, its effect on her was of a kind to be welcomed, as it was far from unpleasant, even though she couldn't precisely define it. She respected him, she esteemed him, she was grateful to him, she felt a real interest in his welfare; and her only remaining question was how much she wanted that welfare to depend upon herself, and how beneficial it would be for both of them if she were to use the power she felt she still possessed to encourage a renewal of his romantic intentions.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "Elizabeth found herself thinking of Pemberley even more this evening than before. The night seemed to drag on, yet it still wasn't enough time for her to truly understand her feelings for its owner, so she spent two hours awake, trying to sort them out. She knew she did not hate him anymore—indeed, she had gotten over her earlier dislike a long time ago, and even felt embarrassed for once feeling that way. The respect she had developed for him, due to recognizing his admirable qualities, had long since stopped being something she resisted; the positive reports she had just heard about him had even made that respect warmer and more friendly. But beyond respect and regard, she couldn't ignore a strong sense of gratitude. She was grateful, not just because he had loved her in the past, but because he still cared enough to forgive her earlier harshness and unfair accusations when she rejected him. Instead of avoiding her, as she had once expected, he was keen to remain on good terms, and, with quiet grace, worked to gain her friends' approval and introduce her to his sister. Such a transformation in someone once so proud amazed and deeply touched her—it had to come from genuine, passionate love. Realizing this, she found her feelings increasingly warm and positive, even if she couldn't quite name them. She respected, admired, and felt grateful to him, and genuinely cared about his happiness; what she didn't yet know was if she wanted his happiness to depend on her, or if it would benefit them both if she encouraged him to propose again, for she believed she still had that power."

Its windows, opening to the ground, admitted a most refreshing view of the high woody hills behind the house, and of the beautiful oaks and Spanish chestnuts which were scattered over the intermediate lawn.\nIn this room they were received by Miss Darcy, who was sitting there with Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley, and the lady with whom she lived in London.

This conviction made her acutely aware of how unwelcome her presence at Pemberley must seem to Miss Bingley, and she was curious to see how civilly, if at all, their acquaintance would be renewed by that lady. Upon reaching the residence, they were guided through the entrance hall into the drawing-room. Its north-facing orientation made it ideal for the summer months. The windows, which opened all the way to the ground, provided a delightful and refreshing view of the high, wooded hills situated behind the house, as well as the beautiful oak and Spanish chestnut trees scattered across the lawn that lay between the room and the hills. In this room, they were greeted by Miss Darcy, who was sitting there with Mrs. Hurst, Miss Bingley, and the woman with whom she resided in London. Georgiana welcomed them very politely, but her reception was marked by the kind of shyness that, though originating from modesty and a fear of making errors, could easily be perceived by those who felt inferior as pride and standoffishness. However, Mrs. Gardiner and her niece recognized her true character and felt sympathy for her. Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley acknowledged them only with a brief curtsey. After they were seated, an awkward silence, as is common in such moments, lasted for a few moments. This silence was first broken by Mrs. Annesley, a well-bred and pleasant-looking woman. Her effort to initiate some form of conversation showed her to be more genuinely well-mannered than either Mrs. Hurst or Miss Bingley. The conversation primarily flowed between Mrs. Annesley and Mrs. Gardiner, with Elizabeth contributing occasionally.

Inside, they were greeted by Miss Darcy, who was sitting with Mrs. Hurst, Miss Bingley, and the lady she lived with in London. Georgiana greeted them courteously, though awkwardly; her nervousness and fear of making mistakes might easily cause those who felt inferior to think she was proud and distant. However, Mrs. Gardiner and Elizabeth understood her and felt sympathy for her. Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley acknowledged them only with a formal nod, and after everyone sat down, there was an uncomfortable silence for a few moments. It was Mrs. Annesley, a refined, pleasant woman, who broke the silence and started a conversation, showing herself to be more genuinely genteel than either of the other ladies. The discussion was mainly kept going by her and Mrs. Gardiner, with occasional input from Elizabeth. Miss Darcy appeared to want to join in, and occasionally managed to say a few words when she felt safest from being overheard."

Miss Bingley, in particular, looked at them with great curiosity, even though she covered it with smiles when she spoke to Darcy—her jealousy had not reached its peak, and she continued to show him considerable attention.

They must be a great loss to your family.”\nIn Darcy’s presence she dared not mention Wickham’s name: but Elizabeth instantly comprehended that he was uppermost in her thoughts; and the various recollections connected with him gave her a moment’s distress; but, exerting herself vigorously to repel the ill-natured attack, she presently answered the question in a tolerably disengaged tone. While she spoke, an involuntary glance showed her Darcy with a heightened complexion, earnestly looking at her, and his sister overcome with confusion, and unable to lift up her eyes. Had Miss Bingley known what pain she was then giving her beloved friend, she undoubtedly would have refrained from the hint; but she had merely intended to discompose Elizabeth, by bringing forward the idea of a man to whom she believed her partial, to make her betray a sensibility which might injure her in Darcy’s opinion, and, perhaps, to remind the latter of all the follies and absurdities by which some part of her family were connected with that corps. Not a syllable had ever reached her of Miss Darcy’s meditated elopement. To no creature had it been revealed, where secrecy was possible, except to Elizabeth; and from all Bingley’s connections her brother was particularly anxious to conceal it, from that very wish which Elizabeth had long ago attributed to him, of their becoming hereafter her own. He had certainly formed such a plan; and without meaning that it should affect his endeavour to separate him from Miss Bennet, it is probable that it might add something to his lively concern for the welfare of his friend.\nElizabeth’s collected behaviour, however, soon quieted his emotion; and as Miss Bingley, vexed and disappointed, dared not approach nearer to Wickham, Georgiana also recovered in time, though not enough to be able to speak any more. Her brother, whose eye she feared to meet, scarcely recollected her interest in the affair; and the very circumstance which had been designed to turn his thoughts from Elizabeth, seemed to have fixed them on her more and more cheerfully.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "Miss Bingley also observed everything and, in a moment of uncontrolled anger, seized the first chance to ask sarcastically and politely, “Excuse me, Miss Eliza, haven’t the \b-\bshire militia left Meryton? I imagine your family must greatly miss them.” She didn't dare mention Wickham by name in Darcy’s presence, but Elizabeth immediately understood he was precisely who Miss Bingley was thinking of. The memories associated with him caused Elizabeth brief distress. However, she quickly regained her composure to deflect the malicious remark and responded to the question quite calmly. As she spoke, she involuntarily noticed Darcy's face was flushed, and he was intently watching her, while his sister was overwhelmed with embarrassment and couldn't look up. If Miss Bingley had realized how much pain she was causing her dear friend Georgiana, she surely would have avoided the comment. But her only aim was to unsettle Elizabeth by bringing up a man she believed Elizabeth favored, hoping to provoke an emotional reaction that would lower her in Darcy’s estimation, and perhaps remind Darcy of the embarrassing connections her family had with that military group. She was completely unaware of Miss Darcy’s planned elopement. This secret had only been shared with Elizabeth where discretion was possible, and Bingley was especially keen to keep it hidden from all his acquaintances, driven by the very hope Elizabeth had long suspected: that he might marry her himself one day. He had certainly conceived this idea, and while not intending it to influence his efforts to separate Darcy from Miss Bennet, it likely added to his deep concern for his friend’s well-being. Elizabeth’s self-possession, however, soon eased Darcy’s agitation. And as Miss Bingley, frustrated and vexed, didn’t dare bring up Wickham more directly, Georgiana also recovered eventually, though she remained too flustered to speak further. Her brother, whom she was afraid to look at, barely registered her discomfort in the situation. The very topic intended to divert his attention from Elizabeth seemed only to focus it on her more intently and favorably.",

Your family must miss them greatly.\" She didn’t dare mention Wickham directly with Darcy present, but Elizabeth knew right away he was at the front of Miss Bingley’s mind; thinking of him made Elizabeth feel upset for a moment. Nevertheless, she quickly composed herself and replied calmly. As Elizabeth answered, she briefly glanced up and saw that Darcy was watching her intently with a flushed face, and Darcy’s sister looked embarrassed and couldn’t meet her eyes. If Miss Bingley had known how much her remark would hurt her dear friend Georgiana, she surely wouldn’t have said it; but her real aim was to upset Elizabeth by hinting at a man she suspected Elizabeth liked, hoping to make her show feelings that might lower her in Darcy’s estimation, and perhaps remind Darcy of the foolish actions some of Elizabeth’s family had connected to the militia. Miss Bingley had never heard even a rumor of Georgiana Darcy’s nearly eloping with Wickham. That secret was kept from everyone except Elizabeth; Darcy especially wanted to hide it from Bingley's social circle, since, as Elizabeth correctly guessed, he hoped Georgiana might one day marry into their family. Though his goal was not to interfere with Bingley and Jane Bennet, his secret plans may have made him even more invested in his friend’s happiness. Nonetheless, Elizabeth’s calm demeanor soon settled Darcy’s feelings, and as Miss Bingley, annoyed and let down, didn’t risk mentioning Wickham again, Georgiana gradually recovered, although she didn’t feel able to speak further. Avoiding her brother’s gaze, she found it easy to forget her own interest in what had happened, while Darcy, far from being distracted from Elizabeth, seemed only to become even more attached to her."

But Georgiana would not join her. Her brother’s recommendation was enough to insure her favour: his judgment could not err; and he had spoken in such terms of Elizabeth, as to leave Georgiana without the power of finding her otherwise than lovely and amiable. When Darcy returned to the saloon, Miss Bingley could not help repeating to him some part of what she had been saying to his sister.\n“How very ill Eliza Bennet looks this morning, Mr. Darcy,” she cried: “I never in my life saw anyone so much altered as she is since the winter. She is grown so brown and coarse! Louisa and I were agreeing that we should not have known her again.”\nHowever little Mr. Darcy might have liked such an address, he contented himself with coolly replying, that he perceived no other alteration than her being rather tanned,—no miraculous consequence of travelling in the summer.\n“For my own part,” she rejoined, “I must confess that I never could see any beauty in her. Her face is too thin; her complexion has no brilliancy; and her features are not at all handsome. Her nose wants character; there is nothing marked in its lines. Her teeth are tolerable, but not out of the common way; and as for her eyes, which have sometimes been called so fine, I never could perceive anything extraordinary in them. They have a sharp, shrewish look, which I do not like at all; and in her air altogether, there is a self-sufficiency without fashion, which is intolerable.”\nPersuaded as Miss Bingley was that Darcy admired Elizabeth, this was not the best method of recommending herself; but angry people are not always wise; and in seeing him at last look somewhat nettled, she had all the success she expected. He was resolutely silent, however; and, from a determination of making him speak, she continued,—\n“I remember, when we first knew her in Hertfordshire, how amazed we all were to find that she was a reputed beauty; and I particularly recollect your saying one night, after they had been dining at Netherfield, ‘She a beauty! I should as soon call her mother a wit.’ But afterwards she seemed to improve on you, and I believe you thought her rather pretty at one time.”\n“Yes,” replied Darcy, who could contain himself no longer, “but that was only when I first knew her; for it is many months since I have considered her as one of the handsomest women of my acquaintance.”\nHe then went away, and Miss Bingley was left to all the satisfaction of having forced him to say what gave no one any pain but herself.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "Their visit ended soon after the aforementioned question and answer. As Mr. Darcy escorted them to their carriage, Miss Bingley unleashed her negative opinions, criticizing Elizabeth’s appearance, behavior, and attire. However, Georgiana refused to participate in the critique. Her brother’s favorable view of Elizabeth was enough to secure her own; she trusted his judgment implicitly, and his description of Elizabeth was so positive that Georgiana couldn't possibly see her as anything less than lovely and pleasant. When Darcy returned to the sitting room, Miss Bingley couldn't resist reiterating some of the harsh comments she had made to his sister. She exclaimed, 'Mr. Darcy, Eliza Bennet looks dreadful this morning! I have never seen anyone change so much since the winter. She has become so tanned and rough-looking! Louisa and I both agreed we wouldn't have recognized her.' Mr. Darcy, despite likely disliking this kind of remark, responded calmly that he only noticed she was a bit tanned, which was unsurprising after traveling in the summer. She retorted, 'Personally, I must admit I've never found her attractive. Her face is too slender, her skin lacks radiance, and her features are not at all appealing. Her nose is plain, with no distinctive shape. Her teeth are acceptable but unremarkable, and as for her eyes, sometimes called beautiful, I've never seen anything special about them. They look sharp and ill-tempered, which I find very off-putting; and overall, she has an arrogant self-assurance without any sense of style, which is unbearable.' Miss Bingley was convinced that Darcy admired Elizabeth, so criticizing her wasn't the best way to make herself appealing. But angry people aren't always rational, and she felt she achieved her goal when she saw him finally look slightly irritated. He remained stubbornly silent, however, and determined to make him speak, she pressed on, 'I recall when we first met her in Hertfordshire, how surprised we all were to hear she was considered a beauty. I distinctly remember you saying one evening, after they had dinner at Netherfield, \"She, a beauty! I would as soon call her mother clever.\" But later you seemed to think better of her, and I believe for a time you considered her rather pretty.' Darcy, unable to hold back any longer, replied, 'Yes, but that was only when I first got to know her; for it has been many months now since I have considered her one of the most beautiful women I know.' He then left, leaving Miss Bingley to the sole satisfaction of having provoked him into a statement that pained no one but herself.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "The visit ended soon after the previous exchange, and as Mr. Darcy escorted the guests to their carriage, Miss Bingley spent the time criticizing Elizabeth's appearance, manners, and clothing. However, Georgiana refused to participate; she trusted her brother's opinion completely, especially since he had praised Elizabeth so highly that Georgiana could only see her as charming and lovely. When Darcy came back into the room, Miss Bingley brought up some of her remarks, saying, \"Doesn't Eliza Bennet look terrible this morning, Mr. Darcy? I've never seen someone change so much since winter—she's gotten so dark and rough! Louisa and I agreed we wouldn't have recognized her.\" Although Darcy disliked her comments, he calmly responded that he only noticed Elizabeth was more tanned, which wasn't surprising after summer travel. Miss Bingley went on, insisting she'd never found Elizabeth attractive: her face was too thin, her complexion dull, her features plain, her nose lacked distinction, her teeth were merely average, and her eyes—often praised—she thought appeared sharp and disagreeable. She added that Elizabeth seemed overly self-assured without elegance, which she found intolerable. Even though Miss Bingley suspected Darcy admired Elizabeth, her approach hardly endeared her to him. But anger often clouds judgment, and since Darcy seemed a bit irritated, Miss Bingley felt she had succeeded. She pressed further, recalling how surprised everyone was in Hertfordshire to learn Elizabeth had a reputation for beauty and even reminded Darcy of his old, dismissive remark comparing Elizabeth's beauty to her mother's wit. She said it seemed Elizabeth grew on him and suggested he used to find her attractive. Unable to stay silent any longer, Darcy admitted that when he first knew Elizabeth, he thought her only somewhat pretty, but for months now, he considered her one of the most beautiful women he knew. With that, he left the room, leaving Miss Bingley unsatisfied except for having made Darcy confess something that only upset herself."

At least he's not marrying for money, since he knows my father can't give her anything. Our poor mother is extremely upset; my father is handling it better. I'm so glad we never told them what we've heard about Wickham; we must try to put it out of our minds ourselves. They apparently left at midnight on Saturday, but weren't missed until eight yesterday morning. The urgent message was sent immediately. Dear Lizzy, they must have passed quite close to us. Colonel Forster says he'll likely be visiting us soon. Lydia left a short note for his wife explaining their plans. I have to end this letter now—I can't stay away from our poor mother for long. I'm afraid you may have trouble reading this, but I'm not sure what I've written myself.\""

Dearest Lizzy, I hardly know what I would write, but I have bad news for you, and it cannot be delayed. Imprudent as a marriage between Mr. Wickham and our poor Lydia would be, we are now anxious to be assured it has taken place, for there is but too much reason to fear they are not gone to Scotland. Colonel Forster came yesterday, having left Brighton the day before, not many hours after the express. Though Lydia’s short letter to Mrs. F. gave them to understand that they were going to Gretna Green, something was dropped by Denny expressing his belief that W. never intended to go there, or to marry Lydia at all, which was repeated to Colonel F., who, instantly taking the alarm, set off from B., intending to trace their route. He did trace them easily to Clapham, but no farther; for on entering that place, they removed into a hackney-coach, and dismissed the chaise that brought them from Epsom. All that is known after this is, that they were seen to continue the London road. I know not what to think. After making every possible inquiry on that side London, Colonel F. came on into Hertfordshire, anxiously renewing them at all the turnpikes, and at the inns in Barnet and Hatfield, but without any success,—no such people had been seen to pass through. With the kindest concern he came on to Longbourn, and broke his apprehensions to us in a manner most creditable to his heart. I am sincerely grieved for him and Mrs. F.; but no one can throw any blame on them. Our distress, my dear Lizzy, is very great. My father and mother believe the worst, but I cannot think so ill of him. Many circumstances might make it more eligible for them to be married privately in town than to pursue their first plan; and even if he could form such a design against a young woman of Lydia’s connections, which is not likely, can I suppose her so lost to everything? Impossible! I grieve to find, however, that Colonel F. is not disposed to depend upon their marriage: he shook his head when I expressed my hopes, and said he feared W. was not a man to be trusted. My poor mother is really ill, and keeps her room. Could she exert herself, it would be better, but this is not to be expected; and as to my father, I never in my life saw him so affected. Poor Kitty has anger for having concealed their attachment; but as it was a matter of confidence, one cannot wonder. I am truly glad, dearest Lizzy, that you have been spared something of these distressing scenes; but now, as the first shock is over, shall I own that I long for your return? I am not so selfish, however, as to press for it, if inconvenient. Adieu! I take up my pen again to do, what I have just told you I would not; but circumstances are such, that I cannot help earnestly begging you all to come here as soon as possible. I know my dear uncle and aunt so well, that I am not afraid of requesting it, though I have still something more to ask of the former. My father is going to London with Colonel Forster instantly, to try to discover her. What he means to do, I am sure I know not; but his excessive distress will not allow him to pursue any measure in the best and safest way, and Colonel Forster is obliged to be at Brighton again to-morrow evening. In such an exigence my uncle’s advice and assistance would be everything in the world; he will immediately comprehend what I must feel, and I rely upon his goodness.”",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "Without pausing to think, and barely aware of her feelings, Elizabeth immediately grabbed the second letter upon finishing the first. Opening it with extreme impatience, she read the following; it had been composed a day after the first letter concluded. “By now, my dearest sister, you will have received my hastily written letter; I hope this one is clearer, but even though I am not limited for time, my mind is so disoriented that I cannot guarantee it will be coherent. Dearest Lizzy, I hardly know what to write, but I have dreadful news for you, and it must be delivered without delay. As inappropriate as a marriage between Mr. Wickham and our unfortunate Lydia would be, we are now anxious to be certain it has occurred, because there is far too much reason to fear they have not gone to Scotland. Colonel Forster arrived yesterday, having departed from Brighton the day before, just a few hours after the express delivery. Although Lydia’s brief note to Mrs. Forster led them to understand that they were heading to Gretna Green, something was said by Denny indicating his belief that Wickham never intended to go there or marry Lydia at all, which was relayed to Colonel Forster. He instantly became alarmed and left Brighton, planning to follow their route. He easily traced them as far as Clapham, but no further; for upon entering that area, they transferred into a hired carriage and dismissed the chaise that had brought them from Epsom. All that is known after this is that they were observed continuing on the road towards London. I am at a loss for what to believe. After conducting every possible inquiry on that side of London, Colonel Forster proceeded into Hertfordshire, anxiously repeating his questions at all the turnpike gates and at the inns in Barnet and Hatfield, but without any success—no such individuals had been seen passing through. With the kindest concern, he came on to Longbourn and revealed his fears to us in a way that was most creditable to his character. I am truly distressed for him and Mrs. Forster; but no one can hold them responsible. Our distress, my dear Lizzy, is profound. My father and mother anticipate the worst, but I cannot view him in such a negative light. Many circumstances might have made it more suitable for them to marry privately in the city than to pursue their initial plan; and even if he were capable of forming such a design against a young woman connected as Lydia is, which seems improbable, can I possibly imagine her being so utterly lost? It’s impossible! I regret to find, however, that Colonel Forster is not inclined to rely on their marriage having taken place: he shook his head when I voiced my hopes and said he feared Wickham was not a man to be trusted. My poor mother is genuinely unwell and remains confined to her room. If she could make an effort, it would be beneficial, but this is not expected; and regarding my father, I have never in my life seen him so deeply affected. Poor Kitty is facing anger for having kept their affection secret; but as it was a matter of confidence, one cannot be surprised. I am genuinely thankful, dearest Lizzy, that you were spared some of these difficult scenes initially; but now that the first shock has passed, shall I admit that I long for your return? I am not so selfish, however, as to urge it if it is inconvenient. Farewell! I am picking up my pen again to do something I just told you I would not; but the circumstances are such that I cannot help but earnestly beg all of you to come here as soon as is feasible. I know my dear uncle and aunt so well that I am not hesitant to ask, although I still have something more to request of the former. My father is leaving for London with Colonel Forster immediately to attempt to find her. What he intends to do, I am truly unaware; but his excessive distress will prevent him from carrying out any course of action in the most effective and safest manner, and Colonel Forster must be back in Brighton by tomorrow evening. In such a critical situation, my uncle’s guidance and support would be invaluable; he will immediately understand what I must be experiencing, and I have faith in his kindness.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "Without stopping to think, and barely aware of her emotions, Elizabeth, after reading the first letter, immediately grabbed the second. She opened it quickly, impatiently, and began to read. This letter was dated a day after the previous one.\n\n\"By now, my dear sister, you will have received my rushed note; I hope this one is clearer, though my mind is in such a frantic state that it may still not make much sense. Dear Lizzy, I am unsure how to write this, but I have troubling news that cannot wait. Though a marriage between Mr. Wickham and our Lydia would not be wise, we are now desperate to know if it has actually happened, because there is much reason to fear they did not go to Scotland after all. Colonel Forster arrived yesterday; he had left Brighton the day before, shortly after the message was sent. Although Lydia’s short note to Mrs. Forster implied they were heading for Gretna Green, something Denny said made him believe Mr. Wickham never meant to go there or to marry Lydia at all. This was told to Colonel Forster, who became alarmed and immediately set off to follow their trail. He was able to track them as far as Clapham, but no further; they switched to a hackney-coach there, dismissing the carriage they’d hired from Epsom. The last known sighting had them continuing on the road to London. I do not know what to think. Colonel Forster searched everywhere on the London side, making inquiries at all the toll gates and at the inns at Barnet and Hatfield, but no one had seen them. Showing great kindness, he then came to Longbourn and broke his fears to us in a most considerate manner. I feel deeply for him and Mrs. Forster; but no one can hold them to blame. Our family is in deep distress, dear Lizzy. My parents fear the worst, but I cannot believe so badly of him. It is possible that they chose to marry in secret in London, rather than continue with their original idea. And even if he could contemplate such a thing with Lydia, which seems unlikely, can I imagine Lydia being so completely lost to propriety? Impossible! Yet it is upsetting that Colonel Forster seems doubtful of their marriage; he shook his head when I expressed hope, and said he feared Wickham could not be trusted. Mother is truly unwell, she has stayed in her room. If she could bring herself to act, it might benefit her, but that's not likely. Father has been more upset than I have ever seen before. Poor Kitty feels guilty for not telling us about Lydia’s connection to Wickham, but as it was a secret, that’s understandable. I am honestly glad, dearest Lizzy, that you’ve been spared the worst of this, but now that the shock has faded, I must admit I wish you would come home. Still, I do not wish to inconvenience you. Goodbye for now! Actually, I must pick up my pen again, because circumstances force me to ask you all to come as soon as possible. I am sure my uncle and aunt will not mind, although I have another favor to ask of him. Father is setting off for London at once with Colonel Forster to try and find Lydia. I do not know what he intends to do, but he is so disturbed that he won’t be able to think things through clearly, and Colonel Forster must return to Brighton by tomorrow evening. In this urgent situation, uncle’s advice and help would be invaluable; he’ll understand how I feel, and I am sure of his kindness.\""

Her pale face and impetuous manner made him start, and before he could recover himself enough to speak, she, in whose mind every idea was superseded by Lydia’s situation, hastily exclaimed, “I beg your pardon, but I must leave you. I must find Mr. Gardiner this moment on business that cannot be delayed; I have not an instant to lose.”\n“Good God! what is the matter?” cried he, with more feeling than politeness; then recollecting himself, “I will not detain you a minute; but let me, or let the servant, go after Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner. You are not well enough; you cannot go yourself.”\nElizabeth hesitated; but her knees trembled under her, and she felt how little would be gained by her attempting to pursue them. Calling back the servant, therefore, she commissioned him, though in so breathless an accent as made her almost unintelligible, to fetch his master and mistress home instantly.\nOn his quitting the room, she sat down, unable to support herself, and looking so miserably ill, that it was impossible for Darcy to leave her, or to refrain from saying, in a tone of gentleness and commiseration, “Let me call your maid. Is there nothing you could take to give you present relief? A glass of wine; shall I get you one? You are very ill.”\n“No, I thank you,” she replied, endeavouring to recover herself. “There is nothing the matter with me.

Her pale face and rushed actions startled him, and before he could regain his composure enough to speak, she, with her mind entirely focused on Lydia’s problem, quickly explained, “I apologize, but I must leave you. I need to find Mr. Gardiner immediately on urgent business; I haven’t a moment to spare.”\n\n“Good God! What is wrong?” he asked, with more emotion than politeness. Then, collecting himself, he said, “I won’t keep you even for a minute, but let me, or let the servant, go after Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner. You don’t look well enough; you can’t go yourself.”\n\nElizabeth hesitated; however, her knees were shaking beneath her, and she realized how little she would accomplish by trying to chase after them. So, she called the servant back and instructed him, although her voice was so breathless she was almost impossible to understand, to bring his master and mistress home at once.\n\nAfter he left the room, she sank into a chair, unable to support herself, and looked so terribly ill that Darcy couldn’t bring himself to leave her or to stop himself from saying gently and with sympathy, “Let me call your maid.

So, calling the servant back, she asked him, her voice shaking so much she was hardly understandable, to bring his master and mistress home right away.  \n\nAfter the servant left, Elizabeth sat down, unable to stand, looking so unwell that Darcy couldn't leave or stay silent.

          "text_segment": "Darcy made no answer. He seemed scarcely to hear her, and was walking up and down the room in earnest meditation; his brow contracted, his air gloomy. Elizabeth soon observed, and instantly understood it. Her power was sinking; everything must sink under such a proof of family weakness, such an assurance of the deepest disgrace. She could neither wonder nor condemn; but the belief of his self-conquest brought nothing consolatory to her bosom, afforded no palliation of her distress. It was, on the contrary, exactly calculated to make her understand her own wishes; and never had she so honestly felt that she could have loved him, as now, when all love must be vain.\nBut self, though it would intrude, could not engross her. Lydia—the humiliation, the misery she was bringing on them all—soon swallowed up every private care; and covering her face with her handkerchief, Elizabeth was soon lost to everything else; and, after a pause of several minutes, was only recalled to a sense of her situation by the voice of her companion, who, in a manner which, though it spoke compassion, spoke likewise restraint, said,—\n“I am afraid you have been long desiring my absence, nor have I anything to plead in excuse of my stay, but real, though unavailing concern. Would to Heaven that anything could be either said or done on my part, that might offer consolation to such distress! But I will not torment you with vain wishes, which may seem purposely to ask for your thanks. This unfortunate affair will, I fear, prevent my sister’s having the pleasure of seeing you at Pemberley to-day.”\n“Oh, yes! Be so kind as to apologize for us to Miss Darcy. Say that urgent business calls us home immediately. Conceal the unhappy truth as long as it is possible. I know it cannot be long.”\nHe readily assured her of his secrecy, again expressed his sorrow for her distress, wished it a happier conclusion than there was at present reason to hope, and, leaving his compliments for her relations, with only one serious parting look, went away.\nAs he quitted the room, Elizabeth felt how improbable it was that they should ever see each other again on such terms of cordiality as had marked their several meetings in Derbyshire; and as she threw a retrospective glance over the whole of their acquaintance, so full of contradictions and varieties, sighed at the perverseness of those feelings which would now have promoted its continuance, and would formerly have rejoiced in its termination.\nIf gratitude and esteem are good foundations of affection, Elizabeth’s change of sentiment will be neither improbable nor faulty. But if otherwise, if the regard springing from such sources is unreasonable or unnatural, in comparison of what is so often described as arising on a first interview with its object, and even before two words have been exchanged, nothing can be said in her defence, except that she had given somewhat of a trial to the latter method, in her partiality for Wickham, and that its ill success might, perhaps, authorize her to seek the other less interesting mode of attachment. Be that as it may, she saw him go with regret; and in this early example of what Lydia’s infamy must produce, found additional anguish as she reflected on that wretched business. Never since reading Jane’s second letter had she entertained a hope of Wickham’s meaning to marry her.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "Darcy remained silent, appearing barely to notice her words as he paced the room deep in thought. His brow furrowed, and his expression was dark. Elizabeth quickly observed this and instantly grasped its meaning. Her hopes for a connection were fading; everything seemed destined to fail in the face of such undeniable proof of her family's weaknesses and the certainty of the deepest disgrace. She felt no surprise or blame towards him, but the awareness that he was controlling his feelings offered her no comfort or relief from her distress. On the contrary, it served precisely to clarify her own desires; she had never felt so genuinely that she could have loved him as she did now, when such love was futile.\nHowever, personal feelings, though present, could not dominate her thoughts. Lydia, and the humiliation and suffering she was inflicting on everyone, soon overshadowed every private concern. Burying her face in her handkerchief, Elizabeth was quickly lost to everything else. After a silence of several minutes, she was only brought back to her surroundings by her companion's voice, which, while conveying sympathy, also showed restraint. He said, 'I fear you have long wished for my departure, and I have no justification for my lingering presence except genuine, though ultimately unhelpful, concern. I wish to Heaven that anything I could say or do might offer solace in such a difficult time! But I will not trouble you with fruitless wishes that might seem designed to elicit your gratitude. This unfortunate situation will, I regret, prevent my sister from having the pleasure of receiving you at Pemberley today.'\n'Oh, yes!' Elizabeth replied. 'Please be so kind as to offer our apologies to Miss Darcy. Explain that urgent matters require us to return home immediately. Please hide the painful truth for as long as possible. I know it cannot remain secret for long.'\nHe readily promised his discretion, reiterated his sorrow for her plight, expressed a wish for a happier resolution than seemed likely at that moment, and conveying his regards to her family with just one serious parting glance, he departed.\nAs he left the room, Elizabeth sensed how unlikely it was they would ever meet again on such friendly terms as they had during their various encounters in Derbyshire. Looking back over the entirety of their acquaintance, which had been full of inconsistencies and shifts, she sighed at the stubbornness of the feelings that now desired its continuation, whereas she would once have been glad for it to end.\nThe author reflects that if gratitude and respect form sound foundations for affection, then Elizabeth's change of heart was both logical and blameless. But if, alternatively, feelings stemming from such sources are considered unreasonable or unnatural when compared to the instant connection often described as arising upon a first meeting, even before a word is exchanged, then nothing can be said in her defense. Except, perhaps, that she had tried the latter approach somewhat through her partiality for Wickham, and its failure might justify her seeking the former, less overtly passionate kind of attachment. Regardless, she watched him leave with regret. In this early demonstration of the consequences of Lydia's disgrace, she found additional pain as she contemplated the whole miserable business. Since reading Jane's second letter, she had never held out hope that Wickham intended to marry Lydia.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "Darcy did not reply; he seemed almost not to hear Elizabeth, and paced the room deeply lost in thought, his expression serious and troubled. Elizabeth noticed this right away and immediately understood its meaning. She felt her influence over him slipping away; everything was bound to be overwhelmed by such clear evidence of her family's weakness, and by the certainty of utter disgrace. She could neither be surprised nor blame him, but knowing that he was restraining himself offered her no comfort and did not lessen her distress. On the contrary, it made her more clearly aware of her own feelings, and never before had she so truly realized that she could have loved him—just when such love was impossible.\n\nYet, although thoughts of herself persisted, they could not dominate her mind. Lydia—the shame and suffering she would bring upon the family—soon took precedence over all personal concerns. Elizabeth covered her face with her handkerchief, lost in grief until, after several minutes, she was brought back to her surroundings by Darcy's voice. With a tone that blended compassion with self-control, he said,\n\n\"I'm afraid you've wanted me to leave for quite a while, and I have no excuse for staying except real, though useless, concern. I wish there was anything I could say or do to comfort you, but I will not trouble you with useless wishes that may look like a request for your gratitude. This unfortunate business will, I fear, prevent my sister from enjoying your visit at Pemberley today.\"\n\n\"Oh yes, please apologize to Miss Darcy for us. Tell her urgent business forces us to return home immediately and hide the unfortunate truth for as long as possible. I know it can't stay hidden for long.\"\n\nHe quickly promised to keep her confidence, once again expressed his sorrow for her suffering, hoped things might end better than now seemed likely, and, sending his regards to her family, left with one last serious look.\n\nAs he left the room, Elizabeth realized how unlikely it was they'd meet again on such friendly terms as before, and as she looked back on their relationship, full of ups and downs, she sighed at the irony that now she wished it could go on, when earlier she’d been glad of its end.\n\nIf affection can be rightly founded on gratitude and respect, Elizabeth’s change of heart is neither strange nor wrong. But if love is only justified when it arises instantly at first sight, with barely a word exchanged—as romantic novels often claim—then there can be no defense for her. Still, she had tried the latter approach in her brief infatuation with Wickham, and its bad outcome may now justify her turning to a more reasonable foundation for love. Whatever the case, she watched Darcy go with regret, and the painful consequences of Lydia’s disgrace became even more acute as she thought on it. Ever since reading Jane’s second letter, she had lost hope that Wickham intended to marry Lydia."

          "text_segment": "No one but Jane, she thought, could flatter herself with such an expectation. Surprise was the least of all her feelings on this development. While the contents of the first letter remained on her mind, she was all surprise, all astonishment, that Wickham should marry a girl whom it was impossible he could marry for money; and how Lydia could ever have attached him had appeared incomprehensible. But now it was all too natural. For such an attachment as this, she might have sufficient charms; and though she did not suppose Lydia to be deliberately engaging in an elopement, without the intention of marriage, she had no difficulty in believing that neither her virtue nor her understanding would preserve her from falling an easy prey.\nShe had never perceived, while the regiment was in Hertfordshire, that Lydia had any partiality for him; but she was convinced that Lydia had wanted only encouragement to attach herself to anybody. Sometimes one officer, sometimes another, had been her favourite, as their attentions raised them in her opinion. Her affections had been continually fluctuating, but never without an object. The mischief of neglect and mistaken indulgence towards such a girl—oh! how acutely did she now feel it!\nShe was wild to be at home—to hear, to see, to be upon the spot to share with Jane in the cares that must now fall wholly upon her, in a family so deranged; a father absent, a mother incapable of exertion, and requiring constant attendance; and though almost persuaded that nothing could be done for Lydia, her uncle’s interference seemed of the utmost importance, and till he entered the room the misery of her impatience was severe. Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner had hurried back in alarm, supposing, by the servant’s account, that their niece was taken suddenly ill; but satisfying them instantly on that head, she eagerly communicated the cause of their summons, reading the two letters aloud, and dwelling on the postscript of the last with trembling energy. Though Lydia had never been a favourite with them, Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner could not but be deeply affected. Not Lydia only, but all were concerned in it; and after the first exclamations of surprise and horror, Mr. Gardiner readily promised every assistance in his power. Elizabeth, though expecting no less, thanked him with tears of gratitude; and all three being actuated by one spirit, everything relating to their journey was speedily settled. They were to be off as soon as possible. “But what is to be done about Pemberley?” cried Mrs. Gardiner. “John told us Mr. Darcy was here when you sent for us;—was it so?”\n“Yes; and I told him we should not be able to keep our engagement. That is all settled.”\n“What is all settled?” repeated the other, as she ran into her room to prepare. “And are they upon such terms as for her to disclose the real truth? Oh, that I knew how it was!”\nBut wishes were vain; or, at best, could serve only to amuse her in the hurry and confusion of the following hour. Had Elizabeth been at leisure to be idle, she would have remained certain that all employment was impossible to one so wretched as herself; but she had her share of business as well as her aunt, and amongst the rest there were notes to be written to all their friends at Lambton, with false excuses for their sudden departure. An hour, however, saw the whole completed; and Mr. Gardiner, meanwhile, having settled his account at the inn, nothing remained to be done but to go; and Elizabeth, after all the misery of the morning, found herself, in a shorter space of time than she could have supposed, seated in the carriage, and on the road to Longbourn.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "Elizabeth reflected that only Jane could entertain such a hopeful idea. Her reaction to this event was far from mere surprise. While she was still processing the first letter, she had been completely astonished that Wickham would marry someone without money, and found it impossible to understand how Lydia could have possibly captured his interest. However, everything now seemed quite logical. Lydia's charm might be sufficient for this particular kind of relationship, and although Elizabeth didn't think Lydia intentionally planned to elope without intending to marry, she had no doubt that Lydia's lack of virtue and judgment would make her easy prey.\nShe hadn't noticed during the regiment's stay in Hertfordshire that Lydia showed any particular preference for Wickham, but she was certain that Lydia merely needed encouragement to become attached to anyone. Sometimes one officer, sometimes another, had been her preferred choice, depending on how their attention made her feel about them. Her feelings were constantly changing, but she was never without someone to focus on. Oh, how keenly she now regretted the harm caused by neglecting and wrongly indulging such a girl!\nShe desperately wanted to be home—to hear the news, see what was happening, and be there to share the burden of care with Jane, which now fell entirely on her in their chaotic family situation. Her father was away, her mother was unable to cope and needed constant looking after. Although Elizabeth was almost convinced that nothing could be done for Lydia, her uncle's intervention seemed extremely important, and her anxious wait until he arrived was agonizing. Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner had rushed back in alarm, assuming from the servant's message that their niece was suddenly ill. However, Elizabeth quickly reassured them on that point and eagerly explained why they had been summoned, reading both letters aloud and speaking with trembling emotion as she emphasized the postscript of the second one. Even though they hadn't favored Lydia particularly, Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner were deeply moved. It wasn't just Lydia, but everyone who was affected by this; and after their initial shocked and horrified reactions, Mr. Gardiner readily offered all the help he could give. Elizabeth, who had expected nothing less, thanked him with tears of gratitude. As they were all united in their purpose, the arrangements for their journey were quickly made. They were to leave as soon as possible. \"But what about Pemberley?\" exclaimed Mrs. Gardiner. \"John told us Mr. Darcy was here when you sent for us; was that true?\"\n\"Yes,\" Elizabeth replied, \"and I told him we would not be able to keep our appointment. That has all been settled.\"\n\"What has all been settled?\" repeated Mrs. Gardiner as she hurried to her room to get ready. \"And are you on such terms that you could tell him the complete truth? Oh, I wish I knew how it all happened!\"\nBut wishing was pointless, or at best, it only served to distract her during the haste and confusion of the next hour. Had Elizabeth had the time to do nothing, she would have felt sure that someone as miserable as herself could not possibly accomplish anything. But she had her share of tasks, just like her aunt. Among other things, she had to write notes to all their friends in Lambton, giving false reasons for their sudden departure. In about an hour, however, everything was finished. Meanwhile, Mr. Gardiner had paid their bill at the inn, so there was nothing left to do but leave. Elizabeth, despite the morning's distress, found herself seated in the carriage on the way to Longbourn in less time than she would have thought possible.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "Elizabeth thought that only Jane could be so optimistic in her expectations. She wasn't surprised by the news—surprise was now the least of her emotions. When she first read the letter, she was shocked that Wickham would marry someone for reasons other than money, and she couldn't understand how Lydia attracted him. Now, however, it made sense to her; perhaps Lydia had enough appeal for such a match. Elizabeth didn't believe Lydia had planned to run away without marrying, but she easily believed that Lydia's lack of judgement and morals would lead her into trouble. While the regiment had been in the area, Elizabeth never noticed Lydia particularly interested in Wickham, but she realized that Lydia just needed a bit of encouragement to attach herself to anyone. Lydia's affections had shifted from officer to officer, depending on who paid her attention, though she never lacked someone to focus on. Elizabeth deeply regretted how neglect and misguided indulgence had contributed to this situation. She was desperate to return home, to help Jane in whatever way she could. With their father away, their mother incapacitated, and the family in chaos, she felt their uncle's involvement was crucial, and the wait for him was agonizing. When Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner returned, worried Elizabeth was ill, she quickly reassured them and explained everything, reading the two letters aloud and emphasizing the postscript. Though Lydia was never their favorite, Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner were strongly affected; it wasn't just about Lydia, but the entire family. After the initial shock, Mr. Gardiner promptly offered his help. Elizabeth, though she'd expected this, thanked him tearfully, and the three quickly made the necessary arrangements for their departure. They would leave as soon as possible. Mrs. Gardiner worried about their previously arranged visit to Pemberley, and Elizabeth explained they'd canceled with Mr. Darcy. Mrs. Gardiner wondered about the closeness between Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy, but there was no time for speculation. Despite her misery, Elizabeth had tasks to complete—writing notes with false reasons for their sudden move to all their friends. An hour later, everything was done, Mr. Gardiner settled the bill at the inn, and they set off, with Elizabeth riding toward Longbourn, still reeling from everything that happened that morning."

It appears to me so very unlikely that any young man should form such a design against a girl who is by no means unprotected or friendless, and who was actually staying in his Colonel’s family, that I am strongly inclined to hope the best. Could he expect that her friends would not step forward? Could he expect to be noticed again by the regiment, after such an affront to Colonel Forster? His temptation is not adequate to the risk.”\n“Do you really think so?” cried Elizabeth, brightening up for a moment.\n“Upon my word,” said Mrs. Gardiner, “I begin to be of your uncle’s opinion. It is really too great a violation of decency, honour, and interest, for him to be guilty of it. I cannot think so very ill of Wickham. Can you, yourself, Lizzie, so wholly give him up, as to believe him capable of it?”\n“Not perhaps of neglecting his own interest. But of every other neglect I can believe him capable. If, indeed, it should be so! But I dare not hope it. Why should they not go on to Scotland, if that had been the case?”\n“In the first place,” replied Mr. Gardiner, “there is no absolute proof that they are not gone to Scotland.”\n“Oh, but their removing from the chaise into a hackney coach is such a presumption! And, besides, no traces of them were to be found on the Barnet road.”\n“Well, then,—supposing them to be in London—they may be there, though for the purpose of concealment, for no more exceptionable purpose. It is not likely that money should be very abundant on either side; and it might strike them that they could be more economically, though less expeditiously, married in London, than in Scotland.”\n“But why all this secrecy? Why any fear of detection? Why must their marriage be private? Oh, no, no—this is not likely. His most particular friend, you see by Jane’s account, was persuaded of his never intending to marry her. Wickham will never marry a woman without some money. He cannot afford it. And what claims has Lydia, what attractions has she beyond youth, health, and good humour, that could make him for her sake forego every chance of benefiting himself by marrying well? As to what restraint the apprehensions of disgrace in the corps might throw on a dishonourable elopement with her, I am not able to judge; for I know nothing of the effects that such a step might produce. But as to your other objection, I am afraid it will hardly hold good. Lydia has no brothers to step forward; and he might imagine, from my father’s behaviour, from his indolence and the little attention he has ever seemed to give to what was going forward in his family, that he would do as little and think as little about it, as any father could do, in such a matter.”\n“But can you think that Lydia is so lost to everything but love of him, as to consent to live with him on any other terms than marriage?”\n“It does seem, and it is most shocking, indeed,” replied Elizabeth, with tears in her eyes, “that a sister’s sense of decency and virtue in such a point should admit of doubt. But, really, I know not what to say. Perhaps I am not doing her justice. But she is very young: she has never been taught to think on serious subjects; and for the last half year, nay, for a twelvemonth, she has been given up to nothing but amusement and vanity. She has been allowed to dispose of her time in the most idle and frivolous manner, and to adopt any opinions that came in her way. Since the ——shire were first quartered in Meryton, nothing but love, flirtation, and officers, have been in her head. She has been doing everything in her power, by thinking and talking on the subject, to give greater—what shall I call it?—susceptibility to her feelings; which are naturally lively enough. And we all know that Wickham has every charm of person and address that can captivate a woman.”",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "“I’ve been thinking about it again, Elizabeth,” her uncle said as they drove away from town. “And honestly, after serious thought, I’m much more inclined than I was before to view the situation the way your eldest sister does. It seems highly unlikely to me that any young man would plan something like this against a girl who certainly isn’t unprotected or without friends, and who was actually staying with his Colonel’s family. Therefore, I'm strongly hoping for the best outcome. Could he possibly think her friends wouldn't intervene? Could he expect the regiment to show him any respect after such an insult to Colonel Forster? The potential gain doesn't justify the risk.”\n“You really think so?” Elizabeth asked, her face brightening for a moment.\n“Upon my word,” said Mrs. Gardiner, “I’m starting to agree with your uncle. It would truly be too severe a violation of decency, honour, and his own self-interest for him to be guilty of it. I can’t think that poorly of Wickham. Lizzie, can you honestly believe he’s completely capable of such a thing?”\n“Perhaps not of neglecting his own interest. But I can believe him capable of every other kind of neglect. Oh, I hope it is as you say! But I don’t dare to hope. Why would they not have just continued on to Scotland if that had been their plan?”\n“Firstly,” replied Mr. Gardiner, “there’s no absolute evidence that they haven’t gone to Scotland.”\n“Oh, but their moving from the carriage into a hackney coach suggests it so strongly! And besides, no sign of them was found on the road towards Scotland (Barnet road).”\n“Well then,” Mr. Gardiner conceded, “assuming they are in London—they might be there for concealment, but for no worse reason. It’s unlikely that either of them has much money, and it might have occurred to them that they could get married more affordably, though perhaps not as quickly, in London than in Scotland.”\n“But why all this secrecy? Why any fear of being found? Why must their marriage be private? Oh, no, no—this doesn’t seem right. As Jane’s account shows, his closest friend was convinced he never intended to marry her. Wickham will never marry a woman without some wealth. He simply cannot afford it. And what does Lydia have, what appeal does she possess beyond her youth, health, and cheerful nature, that could make him sacrifice every chance of benefiting himself by making a good marriage for her sake? As for what restraint the fear of disgrace within the army might impose on a dishonourable elopement with her, I cannot judge; for I know nothing of the consequences such a step might have. But regarding your other point, I’m afraid it hardly holds up. Lydia has no brothers to step forward in her defense; and he might imagine, based on my father’s conduct, his lack of energy, and the little attention he has ever appeared to give to what was happening in his family, that he would do and care as little about it as any father could in such a situation.”\n“But can you imagine that Lydia is so completely consumed by her feelings for him that she would agree to live with him on terms other than marriage?”\n“It does seem, and it truly is most distressing,” replied Elizabeth, with tears in her eyes, “that a sister’s sense of decency and virtue on such a matter should be questionable. But honestly, I don’t know what to say. Perhaps I’m being unfair to her. But she is very young; she has never been taught to think about serious subjects; and for the last six months, indeed, for a whole year, she has been focused solely on amusement and vanity. She has been allowed to spend her time in the most idle and trivial ways, and to adopt whatever opinions she came across. Ever since the ______shire regiment was first based in Meryton, her mind has been full of nothing but romance, flirting, and officers. She has done everything in her power, by constantly thinking and talking about the topic, to make her feelings more—what shall I call it?—receptive; her feelings are naturally quite lively anyway. And we all know that Wickham possesses every personal charm and mannerism that can captivate a woman.”",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "As they left the town, Elizabeth's uncle shared his thoughts again, saying that after giving the situation careful thought, he was now more likely to agree with Jane's optimistic perspective. He reasoned that it seemed improbable for a young man to scheme against a girl who had friends and protection, and who was living with the family of his superior officer, Colonel Forster. He doubted Wickham would risk being cast out by his friends and the regiment for the sake of such a plan, suggesting the risk didn't match any possible benefit. Elizabeth was encouraged to hear this, and Mrs. Gardiner admitted she was starting to feel the same way. She argued that what Wickham was suspected of would go against common decency and his own interests, so she found it hard to think so poorly of him. She asked Elizabeth if she truly believed Wickham was capable of such behavior. Elizabeth replied that, while she doubted Wickham would act against his own advantage, she could believe him capable of many selfish acts. However, she was afraid to hope for the best and questioned why, if Wickham intended to marry Lydia, they hadn't simply gone to Scotland, where such marriages were easy. Mr. Gardiner pointed out there was no proof they hadn't gone to Scotland, but Elizabeth countered that their change from a chaise to a hackney coach and the lack of evidence on the Barnet road suggested otherwise. Mr. Gardiner suggested that hiding in London might be just to keep things quiet and save money, rather than to do anything worse. They discussed why there needed to be secrecy if marriage was the goal, and Elizabeth argued that Wickham was unlikely to marry Lydia, since he needed wealth in a wife, and Lydia offered little beyond youth and good humor. She also pointed out that Lydia had no brothers to protect her, and their father had always been rather inattentive, so Wickham might expect little interference. Mrs. Gardiner asked if Elizabeth thought Lydia could really consent to live with Wickham unmarried. Elizabeth, very upset, admitted it was terrible to doubt her sister's morals, but she found it hard not to, since Lydia was young and had been indulged and allowed to behave frivolously for the past year. Since the regiment came to Meryton, Lydia had thought only of officers and flirting, and Elizabeth feared that Lydia's lively feelings, combined with Wickham's charm, had made her vulnerable."

The Collinses will turn us out, before he is cold in his grave; and if you are not kind to us, brother, I do not know what we shall do.”\nThey all exclaimed against such terrific ideas; and Mr. Gardiner, after general assurances of his affection for her and all her family, told her that he meant to be in London the very next day, and would assist Mr. Bennet in every endeavour for recovering Lydia.\n“Do not give way to useless alarm,” added he: “though it is right to be prepared for the worst, there is no occasion to look on it as certain. It is not quite a week since they left Brighton. In a few days more, we may gain some news of them; and till we know that they are not married, and have no design of marrying, do not let us give the matter over as lost. As soon as I get to town, I shall go to my brother, and make him come home with me to Gracechurch Street, and then we may consult together as to what is to be done.”\n“Oh, my dear brother,” replied Mrs. Bennet, “that is exactly what I could most wish for. And now do, when you get to town, find them out, wherever they may be; and if they are not married already, make them marry. And as for wedding clothes, do not let them wait for that, but tell Lydia she shall have as much money as she chooses to buy them, after they are married. And, above all things, keep Mr. Bennet from fighting. Tell him what a dreadful state I am in—that I am frightened out of my wits; and have such tremblings, such flutterings all over me, such spasms in my side, and pains in my head, and such beatings at my heart, that I can get no rest by night nor by day. And tell my dear Lydia not to give any directions about her clothes till she has seen me, for she does not know which are the best warehouses. Oh, brother, how kind you are! I know you will contrive it all.”",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "Jane eagerly went to meet her uncle and aunt, expressing her welcome and thanks with a mix of smiles and tears. Once they were all gathered in the drawing-room, everyone else repeated the questions about Lydia and Wickham that Elizabeth had already asked. They quickly discovered that Jane had no new information to share. However, her naturally hopeful and kind disposition meant she still expected a positive outcome; she remained confident that everything would resolve favorably and that every morning would bring a letter from either Lydia or her father explaining what happened, perhaps even announcing a marriage. They all moved to Mrs. Bennet's room after a short conversation. Her reception was exactly as expected: full of tears, expressing sorrow, strongly criticizing Wickham's wicked actions, and complaining about her own suffering and unfair treatment. She blamed everyone except the person (herself) whose poor judgment and excessive leniency were primarily responsible for her daughter's mistakes. She declared, \"If only I had been allowed to take my whole family to Brighton, this wouldn't have occurred. But my poor dear Lydia had no one looking after her. Why did the Forsters ever let her out of their sight? I'm certain there was some significant carelessness on their part, as she's not the sort of girl who would do this if she'd been properly supervised. I always felt they weren't fit to be in charge of her, but I was overridden, as I always am. My poor, dear child! And now Mr. Bennet has gone away, and I know he'll fight Wickham wherever they meet, and then he'll be killed. What will become of us? The Collinses will evict us before he's even buried. Brother, if you aren't good to us, I don't know what we'll do.\" Everyone protested against her terrifying ideas. Mr. Gardiner then reassured her and the family of his affection and promised to go to London the very next day to help Mr. Bennet in every possible way to find Lydia. He added, \"Don't give in to pointless worry. While it's wise to be ready for the worst, there's no reason to assume it will happen. It's barely been a week since they left Brighton. In a few more days, we might get some news. And until we know they aren't married and have no intention of marrying, let's not consider the situation hopeless. As soon as I reach London, I'll go to my brother and bring him back with me to Gracechurch Street so we can plan what to do together.\" Mrs. Bennet responded, \"Oh, my dear brother, that's exactly what I want most! And now, when you get to town, please find them, no matter where they are. And if they aren't married yet, make them marry. And don't let them delay for wedding clothes; tell Lydia she can have all the money she wants for them once they're married. And most importantly, keep Mr. Bennet from fighting. Tell him how terribly distressed I am—that I'm completely terrified and have such shaking, such trembling all over, such spasms in my side, headaches, and heart palpitations that I can't rest day or night. And tell my dear Lydia not to decide on her clothes until she sees me, because she doesn't know which shops are best. Oh, brother, you are so kind! I know you'll arrange everything.\"",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "Jane rushed to greet her uncle and aunt, expressing her gratitude through both smiles and tears. Once everyone was gathered in the drawing-room, the same questions Elizabeth had already posed were repeated by the others, but it became clear that Jane had no new information to offer. Still, her hopeful and kind nature made her believe that things would turn out well eventually, and she expected that each day might bring a letter from either Lydia or Mr. Bennet to clarify what was happening, or possibly announce a marriage. \n\nThey soon joined Mrs. Bennet in her room, who reacted as expected—with tears, regrets, angry criticism of Wickham's behavior, and complaints about her own suffering and mistreatment. She blamed everyone except the person whose permissive behavior had truly enabled Lydia's errors. Mrs. Bennet insisted that if she had managed to bring the whole family to Brighton, none of this would have occurred, lamenting that Lydia had no one to look after her. She criticized the Forsters for their neglect and claimed Lydia would never have acted that way if she’d been properly supervised. She said she’d always doubted the Forsters' suitability, but her opinions had been set aside. Mourning for her daughter, Mrs. Bennet also worried that Mr. Bennet, who had now gone away, would end up dueling Wickham and be killed, leaving the family to be turned out of their home by the Collinses, unless her brother helped them.\n\nThe others protested against these terrible imaginings. In response, Mr. Gardiner reassured her of his affection and promised to go to London the following day to help Mr. Bennet search for Lydia. He told Mrs. Bennet not to panic needlessly; although it was wise to prepare for the worst, there was no reason to assume the worst had happened, since it had only been less than a week since Lydia and Wickham left Brighton—they might soon hear from them. He promised as soon as he reached London, he’d find Mr. Bennet and bring him to Gracechurch Street, so they could work together to decide on next steps.\n\nOverwhelmed with gratitude, Mrs. Bennet said that was exactly what she wanted, asking her brother to find the couple and, if Lydia and Wickham weren’t already married, to make sure they became so. She told him not to let the wedding be delayed for new clothes, promising Lydia would get spending money afterwards. She also begged her brother to keep Mr. Bennet from dueling, instructing him to explain how distraught and unwell she was, with various aches and no peace day or night. She asked him to remind Lydia not to settle her wardrobe without Mrs. Bennet’s advice, since Lydia didn’t know the best places to shop. Finally, she thanked her brother profusely, trusting he would organize everything."

One came from her books, and the other from her toilette. The faces of both, however, were tolerably calm; and no change was visible in either, except that the loss of her favourite sister, or the anger which she had herself incurred in the business, had given something more of fretfulness than usual to the accents of Kitty. As for Mary, she was mistress enough of herself to whisper to Elizabeth, with a countenance of grave reflection, soon after they were seated at table,—\n“This is a most unfortunate affair, and will probably be much talked of. But we must stem the tide of malice, and pour into the wounded bosoms of each other the balm of sisterly consolation.”\nThen perceiving in Elizabeth no inclination of replying, she added, “Unhappy as the event must be for Lydia, we may draw from it this useful lesson:—that loss of virtue in a female is irretrievable, that one false step involves her in endless ruin, that her reputation is no less brittle than it is beautiful, and that she cannot be too much guarded in her behaviour towards the undeserving of the other sex.”\nElizabeth lifted up her eyes in amazement, but was too much oppressed to make any reply. Mary, however, continued to console herself with such kind of moral extractions from the evil before them.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "Mr. Gardiner, while assuring her he would do his utmost to help, felt he had to advise Mrs. Bennet to keep her hopes and fears in check. After discussing the matter with her until dinner was served, he and his wife left her to express her intense emotions to the housekeeper, who was looking after the house in the absence of her daughters. Although her brother and sister-in-law thought Mrs. Bennet's self-imposed isolation from the family was unnecessary, they didn't try to stop it. They knew she couldn't be trusted to keep her thoughts to herself in front of the servants during dinner and judged it better that only one trusted member of the household understand the full extent of her worries. Mary and Kitty, who had been too busy in their separate rooms (one reading, the other attending to her appearance) to appear earlier, soon joined them in the dining room. Both looked reasonably calm, with no obvious change, except that Kitty's voice carried a little more irritation than usual, likely due to losing her preferred sister or the trouble she herself had contributed to the situation. Mary, however, was composed enough to lean towards Elizabeth shortly after they were seated and quietly remark, with a serious look, 'This is a most unfortunate situation, and it will probably be widely discussed. But we must resist the negative talk and offer each other the comfort of sisterly support.' Seeing Elizabeth didn't seem about to reply, she added, 'As unhappy as this event must be for Lydia, we can learn this important lesson: a woman's lost virtue is irreversible, one wrong step leads to endless destruction, her reputation is as easily broken as it is beautiful, and she cannot be too careful in how she behaves towards men of questionable character.' Elizabeth stared in disbelief, too burdened to say anything. However, Mary continued to extract such moral lessons from the negative situation to comfort herself.",

He talked to her in this way until it was time for dinner, then left her to express her emotions to the housekeeper, who was there in place of her daughters. Even though her brother and sister believed there was no real reason for her to separate herself from the rest of the family, they didn't try to stop her, since they knew she couldn’t keep her thoughts to herself in front of the servants and that it was better for only one trusted household member to hear all her concerns and distress. Soon after, Mary and Kitty joined the others in the dining room, having been occupied in their own rooms—Mary with books, Kitty with her appearance. Both appeared fairly composed, but Kitty’s voice betrayed more irritation than usual, perhaps from losing her favorite sister or from being scolded. Mary, remaining calm, quietly told Elizabeth that the situation was most unfortunate and likely to become the subject of gossip, but they should support each other as sisters. Noticing that Elizabeth did not wish to reply, Mary went on to say that Lydia’s misfortune could teach them an important lesson: a woman’s reputation is delicate, one mistake can lead to lasting disgrace, and women must be especially careful in their behavior around unworthy men. Elizabeth, surprised, said nothing, weighed down by her worries; nevertheless, Mary found comfort in drawing such moral lessons from the situation."

They must have seen them together for ever.”\n“Colonel Forster did own that he had often suspected some partiality, especially on Lydia’s side, but nothing to give him any alarm.

Had Colonel Forster seen Denny himself?”\n“Yes; but when questioned by him, Denny denied knowing anything of their plan, and would not give his real opinion about it.

I felt a little uneasy—a little fearful of my sister’s happiness with him in marriage, because I knew that his conduct had not been always quite right. My father and mother knew nothing of that; they only felt how imprudent a match it must be. Kitty then owned, with a very natural triumph on knowing more than the rest of us, that in Lydia’s last letter she had prepared her for such a step. She had known, it seems, of their being in love with each other many weeks.”\n“But not before they went to Brighton?”\n“No, I believe not.”\n“And did Colonel Forster appear to think ill of Wickham himself? Does he know his real character?”\n“I must confess that he did not speak so well of Wickham as he formerly did. He believed him to be imprudent and extravagant; and since this sad affair has taken place, it is said that he left Meryton greatly in debt: but I hope this may be false.”\n“Oh, Jane, had we been less secret, had we told what we knew of him, this could not have happened!”\n“Perhaps it would have been better,” replied her sister.\n“But to expose the former faults of any person, without knowing what their present feelings were, seemed unjustifiable.”\n“We acted with the best intentions.”",

Give me more details. What did Colonel Forster say? Did they have any suspicions before the elopement happened? They must have been constantly together.”\n\n“Colonel Forster admitted he had often suspected some favoritism, particularly from Lydia, but nothing that caused him alarm. I feel so awful for him. His conduct was incredibly considerate and helpful. He was coming to check on us to express his concern even before he suspected they hadn’t gone to Scotland; when that worry first emerged, it prompted him to hurry his journey.”\n\n“And was Denny convinced Wickham wouldn’t marry her? Did he know they planned to run away? Had Colonel Forster spoken to Denny himself?”\n\n“Yes, he did. But when Colonel Forster questioned him, Denny denied knowing anything about their plan and refused to share his real opinion. He didn’t repeat his belief that they wouldn’t marry, which makes me hope he might have been misunderstood before.”\n\n“And I assume none of you doubted they were genuinely married until Colonel Forster arrived in person?”\n\n“How could we possibly think otherwise? I felt a little uneasy—a bit apprehensive about my sister’s happiness with him in marriage because I knew his past actions hadn’t always been upright. Father and Mother weren’t aware of that; they just felt it would be a terribly unwise match. Then Kitty admitted, with understandable pride at knowing more than the rest of us, that Lydia’s last letter had prepared her for such a step. It appears she had known they were in love for several weeks.”\n\n“But not before they went to Brighton?”\n\n“No, I don’t think so.”\n\n“And did Colonel Forster seem to have a negative view of Wickham personally? Does he know what he’s really like?”\n\n“I must admit he didn’t speak as favorably of Wickham as he used to. He believed him to be reckless and wasteful; and since this unfortunate incident, it’s rumored he left Meryton heavily in debt, but I hope that’s not true.”\n\n“Oh, Jane, if only we had been less secretive, if only we had shared what we knew about him, this wouldn’t have happened!”\n\n“Perhaps it would have been better,” her sister replied.\n\n“But it seemed unfair to reveal someone's past mistakes without knowing how they felt at the time.”\n\n“We had the best intentions.”",

Elizabeth quickly took advantage of this chance to ask Jane everything she wanted to know, and Jane was just as willing to share what she knew. After both sisters expressed their distress over what they saw as the likely disastrous outcome of recent events—though Jane would not say it was impossible to end better—Elizabeth pressed for more details. She asked about Colonel Forster's thoughts, if there had been any suspicion before Lydia ran off, and whether people had noticed Lydia and Wickham spending so much time together. Jane explained that Colonel Forster did suspect Lydia had a crush on Wickham, but saw nothing serious enough to worry him. He had behaved as considerately as possible, and rushed to the Bennets to express his concern as soon as he got the sense that Lydia and Wickham might not be heading to Scotland as presumed. Elizabeth then asked about Denny and whether he believed Wickham had no intention of marrying Lydia, and whether Denny was aware of their plans. Jane answered that Denny, when asked, denied knowing anything about it and wouldn’t say what he really thought, which made her hope his previous concerns had been misunderstood. Elizabeth then asked whether anyone doubted that the couple might not be getting married before Colonel Forster's visit—and Jane assured her that nobody had considered such an idea. Jane admitted she'd felt a bit uneasy about Lydia’s happiness with Wickham, knowing about his past misbehavior, though their parents saw only that it was a risky match. Kitty, meanwhile, had privately boasted that she already suspected such an elopement, having been told by Lydia in her last letter that it might happen; Kitty said she had known for weeks about their mutual affection, but not before Brighton. Elizabeth asked if Colonel Forster now thought worse of Wickham, and Jane replied that the Colonel’s opinion of him had declined, now seeing Wickham as reckless and wasteful, with rumors that he owed large sums when he left Meryton—though Jane hoped those were just rumors. Elizabeth lamented that if they’d been more open about what they knew of Wickham’s character, the situation might have been avoided, but Jane said that might have been better, though airing someone’s past faults without proof of their current intentions felt wrong, and they had acted as prudently as they could at the time."

She announced she was heading to Gretna Green and joked that Harriet would be foolish if she couldn't guess her companion, as there was only one man in the world she adored, whom she considered an angel. Lydia declared she could never be content without him, seeing no harm in their departure. She told Harriet there was no need to inform her family at Longbourn immediately if she preferred not to, as this would increase the surprise when she eventually wrote to them, signing herself 'Lydia Wickham.' She exclaimed how humorous she found the situation and admitted she could barely write due to her mirth. She asked Harriet to offer her apologies to Pratt for breaking their arrangement to dance that evening, hoping he would understand when he learned the full story and promising to dance with him with great pleasure at their next meeting. She stated she would arrange for her clothing to be sent from Longbourn later but requested that Sally be instructed to repair a significant tear in her worked muslin dress before it was packed. She concluded with 'Good-bye,' sent her regards to Colonel Forster, and expressed hope that Harriet would toast their successful journey.\n\nThe letter was signed, 'Your affectionate friend, Lydia Bennet.'",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "“Could Colonel Forster give the details of Lydia’s letter to his wife?” \n“He brought the letter with him so we could read it.” \nJane then took the letter from her pocketbook and handed it to Elizabeth. This is what it said:\n\n“My dear Harriet,\nYou will be so amused when you find out where I have gone, and I am already laughing to think how surprised you’ll be tomorrow when you notice I am missing. I am heading to Gretna Green, and if you can’t guess who I’m with, I’ll think you quite foolish, because there is only one man in the world I love, and he is wonderful. I could never be happy without him, so I hope you don’t think it wrong that I have left. Don’t feel you must inform the family at Longbourn about my departure unless you want to, as it will make my eventual letter to them, signed Lydia Wickham, even more of a surprise. Isn’t it a great joke? I can barely write for laughing. Please apologize to Pratt for me for missing my promise to dance with him tonight. Tell him I hope he’ll forgive me when he knows all, and that I’d be happy to dance with him at the next ball we both attend. I’ll arrange to get my clothes sent to Longbourn, but please let Sally know to fix the large tear in my embroidered muslin dress before she packs them. Goodbye. Give my best to Colonel Forster. I hope you’ll have a drink to wish us a good journey.\nYour affectionate friend,\nLydia Bennet.”"

My poor father! how he must have felt it!”\n“I never saw anyone so shocked. He could not speak a word for full ten minutes. My mother was taken ill immediately, and the whole house in such confusion!”\n“Oh, Jane,” cried Elizabeth, “was there a servant belonging to it who did not know the whole story before the end of the day?”\n“I do not know: I hope there was. But to be guarded at such a time is very difficult. My mother was in hysterics; and though I endeavoured to give her every assistance in my power, I am afraid I did not do so much as I might have done. But the horror of what might possibly happen almost took from me my faculties.”\n“Your attendance upon her has been too much for you. You do not look well. Oh that I had been with you! you have had every care and anxiety upon yourself alone.”\n“Mary and Kitty have been very kind, and would have shared in every fatigue, I am sure, but I did not think it right for either of them. Kitty is slight and delicate, and Mary studies so much that her hours of repose should not be broken in on. My aunt Philips came to Longbourn on Tuesday, after my father went away; and was so good as to stay till Thursday with me. She was of great use and comfort to us all, and Lady Lucas has been very kind: she walked here on Wednesday morning to condole with us, and offered her services, or any of her daughters, if they could be of use to us.”\n“She had better have stayed at home,” cried Elizabeth: “perhaps she meant well, but, under such a misfortune as this, one cannot see too little of one’s neighbours. Assistance is impossible; condolence, insufferable. Let them triumph over us at a distance, and be satisfied.”\nShe then proceeded to inquire into the measures which her father had intended to pursue, while in town, for the recovery of his daughter.\n“He meant, I believe,” replied Jane, “to go to Epsom, the place where they last changed horses, see the postilions, and try if anything could be made out from them. His principal object must be to discover the number of the hackney coach which took them from Clapham. It had come with a fare from London; and as he thought the circumstance of a gentleman and lady’s removing from one carriage into another might be remarked, he meant to make inquiries at Clapham. If he could anyhow discover at what house the coachman had before set down his fare, he determined to make inquiries there, and hoped it might not be impossible to find out the stand and number of the coach. I do not know of any other designs that he had formed; but he was in such a hurry to be gone, and his spirits so greatly discomposed, that I had difficulty in finding out even so much as this.”",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "Upon finishing the letter, Elizabeth exclaimed, “Oh, Lydia, how utterly thoughtless you are! To write such a letter at such a moment! However, it does at least prove she was serious about the purpose of her journey. Whatever Wickham may have later convinced her to do, it wasn't a wicked plan on her part from the beginning. My poor father! How terribly he must have felt it!” Jane replied, “I've never seen anyone so shocked. He couldn't utter a word for a full ten minutes. My mother immediately became ill, and the entire household was thrown into complete chaos!” Elizabeth cried, “Oh, Jane, was there a single servant in the house who didn't know the whole story by the end of the day?” Jane said, “I don't know; I hope not. But it's very hard to maintain discretion at such a time. My mother was hysterical, and although I tried my best to help her, I fear I didn't do as much as I could have. But the sheer terror of what might happen nearly robbed me of my senses.” Elizabeth responded, “Taking care of her has been too much for you. You don't look well. I wish I had been there with you! You've borne all the worry and stress entirely by yourself.” Jane explained, “Mary and Kitty were very kind and would have helped with everything, I'm sure, but I didn't think it was right for either of them. Kitty is frail and delicate, and Mary studies so much that her rest shouldn't be interrupted. Our aunt Philips came to Longbourn on Tuesday, after my father left, and was good enough to stay with me until Thursday. She was a great help and comfort to all of us. Lady Lucas has also been very kind; she walked here on Wednesday morning to offer her sympathies and her services, or those of any of her daughters, if they could assist us.” Elizabeth exclaimed, “She would have done better to stay home! Perhaps she meant well, but during such a disaster, the less one sees of one's neighbors, the better. Help is impossible; sympathy is unbearable. Let them celebrate our misfortune from a distance and be content.” Elizabeth then asked about the steps her father planned to take in London to find his daughter. Jane replied, “He intended, I believe, to go to Epsom, where they last changed horses, speak to the post-boys, and see if they could learn anything from them. His main goal must be to find the number of the hired coach that took them from Clapham. It had arrived there with a passenger from London, and since he thought the situation of a gentleman and lady switching from one carriage to another might have been noticed, he planned to make inquiries at Clapham. If he could somehow find out at which house the coachman had previously dropped off his passenger, he was determined to ask there, hoping it might be possible to discover the coach's stand and number. I don't know of any other plans he made, but he was in such a rush to leave, and so greatly distressed, that I had trouble finding out even this much.”",

Still, it does show she was sincere in her reasons for leaving. No matter what he may have convinced her to do later, she herself did not set out with disgraceful intentions. Poor father—how terrible he must have felt!\"\n\n\"I've never seen anyone so shocked. He was speechless for a full ten minutes. Mother fell ill at once, and the whole house was in chaos!\"\n\n\"Oh, Jane,\" said Elizabeth, \"didn't every servant in the house hear the news before the day was over?\"\n\n\"I'm not sure; I hope not. But it was hard to keep anything quiet. Mother was in hysterics, and though I did all I could, I fear I didn't help as much as I should have. The horror of what might happen nearly overwhelmed me.\"\n\n\"You've overexerted yourself caring for her. You look unwell. I wish I could have been there to help you—it's all been left for you to manage.\"\n\n\"Mary and Kitty were helpful and would have shared all the work, but I didn't think it right to burden them. Kitty is delicate, and Mary studies so hard she needs her rest. Aunt Philips came to Longbourn after father left and stayed with me until Thursday; she was truly helpful and comforting. Lady Lucas has been very kind, too; she came over on Wednesday to offer her sympathy and any help she or her daughters could give.\"\n\n\"She should have stayed away,\" said Elizabeth. \"Her intentions might have been good, but at times like these, seeing too many neighbors is unbearable. No one can help us, and their sympathy is insufferable. Let them gloat at a distance.\"\n\nElizabeth then asked Jane what steps their father intended to take in London to find Lydia.\n\n\"I believe he planned to go to Epsom, where they last changed horses, to speak to the postilions and see what he could learn. His main aim is to find the hackney coach's number that took them from Clapham. Because the coach brought them from London, and as it might be noticed when a gentleman and lady move to another carriage, he intended to inquire at Clapham. If he could find out where the coachman dropped his previous fare, he was determined to investigate there, too, hoping to trace both the coach's stand and number.

But, on reflection, perhaps Lizzy could tell us better than anyone else about the relatives he currently has living.\" Elizabeth easily understood the reason for this assumption about her knowing; however, she was unable to provide information as useful as the compliment suggested she might.",

Now, he was resolved to check all the main hotels in London, thinking that Lydia and Wickham may have stayed at one when they first arrived before arranging their own accommodations. Mr. Gardiner doubted this plan would yield results, but agreed to help since his brother was so determined. Mr. Bennet did not want to leave London for the moment and promised to write again soon. In a postscript, Mr. Gardiner said he had written to Colonel Forster to see if any of Wickham’s friends in the regiment knew whether Wickham had any family or acquaintances who might know his current whereabouts. Such a lead could prove vital, but right now they had no clues. He was sure Colonel Forster would do his best to help, but suggested that perhaps Elizabeth herself might know more about Wickham’s surviving relations. Elizabeth understood why they sought her opinion, but unfortunately, she couldn’t provide any more helpful information than the expression of confidence in her knowledge warranted."

It was as follows:—\n“My dear Sir,\n“I feel myself called upon, by our relationship, and my situation in life, to condole with you on the grievous affliction you are now suffering under, of which we were yesterday informed by a letter from Hertfordshire. Be assured, my dear sir, that Mrs. Collins and myself sincerely sympathize with you, and all your respectable family, in your present distress, which must be of the bitterest kind, because proceeding from a cause which no time can remove. No arguments shall be wanting on my part, that can alleviate so severe a misfortune; or that may comfort you, under a circumstance that must be, of all others, most afflicting to a parent’s mind. The death of your daughter would have been a blessing in comparison of this. And it is the more to be lamented, because there is reason to suppose, as my dear Charlotte informs me, that this licentiousness of behaviour in your daughter has proceeded from a faulty degree of indulgence; though, at the same time, for the consolation of yourself and Mrs. Bennet, I am inclined to think that her own disposition must be naturally bad, or she could not be guilty of such an enormity, at so early an age. Howsoever that may be, you are grievously to be pitied; in which opinion I am not only joined by Mrs. Collins, but likewise by Lady Catherine and her daughter, to whom I have related the affair. They agree with me in apprehending that this false step in one daughter will be injurious to the fortunes of all the others: for who, as Lady Catherine herself condescendingly says, will connect themselves with such a family? And this consideration leads me, moreover, to reflect, with augmented satisfaction, on a certain event of last November; for had it been otherwise, I must have been involved in all your sorrow and disgrace. Let me advise you, then, my dear sir, to console yourself as much as possible, to throw off your unworthy child from your affection for ever, and leave her to reap the fruits of her own heinous offence.\n“I am, dear sir,” etc., etc.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "However, before hearing from Mr. Gardiner again, a letter arrived for their father from a different person, Mr. Collins. Since Jane had instructions to open his mail while he was away, she read it aloud. Elizabeth, knowing how strange his letters usually were, leaned over and read it along with her. The letter said:\n\n'My dear Sir,\n\nGiven our family relationship and my position, I feel obligated to offer my condolences regarding the terrible trouble you are currently enduring, which we learned about yesterday from a letter from Hertfordshire. Please know, my dear sir, that Mrs. Collins and I sincerely share in the grief affecting you and your entire respected family during this crisis. It must be the most painful kind of distress because it stems from something that cannot be undone by time. I will certainly offer any arguments I can that might lessen such a severe misfortune or comfort you in a situation that must be, above all others, the most upsetting for a parent. Your daughter's death would have been a blessing compared to this. It's even more regrettable because there is reason to believe, as my dear Charlotte tells me, that your daughter's loose conduct resulted from an excessive amount of leniency. However, at the same time, to offer some comfort to you and Mrs. Bennet, I am inclined to believe that her basic character must be inherently flawed, or she couldn't have committed such a terrible act at such a young age. Regardless, you are truly to be pitied, an opinion shared not only by Mrs. Collins but also by Lady Catherine and her daughter, to whom I have explained the situation. They agree with me that this one daughter's misstep will harm the prospects of all the others; for who, as Lady Catherine herself graciously put it, will want to associate with such a family? This thought also makes me reflect, with increased satisfaction, on something that happened last November. Had it turned out differently, I would now be caught up in all your sorrow and dishonor. Therefore, my dear sir, let me advise you to comfort yourself as best as possible, to permanently cast off your unworthy child from your affection, and let her face the consequences of her terrible wrongdoing.\n\n'Yours sincerely,' etc., etc.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "Before they received further news from Mr. Gardiner, Mr. Bennet got a letter from Mr. Collins, which Jane, as she had been asked to do in their father's absence, opened and read. Elizabeth, already expecting Mr. Collins's letters to be odd, looked over Jane's shoulder and read along. The letter said:\n\n\"My dear sir,\nI feel obliged, as your relative and due to my social standing, to offer my condolences for your current great misfortune, which we only learned about yesterday from a letter from Hertfordshire. Please know that Mrs. Collins and I truly sympathize with you and your family during this distress, which must be exceptionally painful, arising as it does from a cause that cannot be undone. I will do all I can to help ease your suffering and support you in this difficult time, which must be one of the most severe a parent can endure. It would have been better, in my opinion, if your daughter had died than what has happened now. It is even sadder, as my wife Charlotte tells me, to think that your daughter's improper conduct may be due to too much leniency, although, for your and Mrs. Bennet's comfort, I would like to think she must naturally have a bad character to do something so terrible at such a young age. Regardless, you have my deepest sympathy, as do Mrs. Collins, Lady Catherine, and her daughter, to whom I've told about what happened. They agree with me that this scandal involving one daughter will harm the chances of all the others; for, as Lady Catherine herself pointed out, who would want to be connected to a family with such a reputation? This also makes me even more relieved about what happened last November; otherwise, I too would have been dragged into your sorrow and disgrace. So, my advice is to comfort yourself as much as you can, cast off your unworthy daughter forever, and let her suffer the consequences of her terrible actions.\n\nYours, etc.\""

His former acquaintance had been numerous; but since he had been in the militia, it did not appear that he was on terms of particular friendship with any of them. There was no one, therefore, who could be pointed out as likely to give any news of him. And in the wretched state of his own finances, there was a very powerful motive for secrecy, in addition to his fear of discovery by Lydia’s relations; for it had just transpired that he had left gaming debts behind him to a very considerable amount. Colonel Forster believed that more than a thousand pounds would be necessary to clear his expenses at Brighton. He owed a good deal in the town, but his debts of honour were still more formidable. Mr. Gardiner did not attempt to conceal these particulars from the Longbourn family; Jane heard them with horror. “A gamester!” she cried. “This is wholly unexpected; I had not an idea of it.”\nMr. Gardiner added, in his letter, that they might expect to see their father at home on the following day, which was Saturday.

Therefore, no one could be identified who was likely to provide any news of his whereabouts. Moreover, given the deplorable state of his personal finances, he had a strong motive for concealment, quite apart from fearing discovery by Lydia's family. It had just come out that he had accumulated significant gambling debts. Colonel Forster believed it would take over a thousand pounds to cover his costs incurred at Brighton. He owed a good deal within the town, but his gambling debts were even more serious. Mr. Gardiner did not attempt to keep these specifics from the Longbourn family; Jane reacted with horror upon hearing them. \"A gambler!\" she cried out. \"This is completely astonishing; I had no conception of it.\" In his letter, Mr. Gardiner also mentioned that they should anticipate their father returning home the following day, which was Saturday.

Although he had known many people in the past, since joining the militia he didn't seem to have formed any particular close friendships. Therefore, there was no one they could approach for information about him. Besides fearing that Lydia's family might find out, Wickham also had strong reasons to keep hidden because his finances were in terrible shape—it had recently come to light that he had left behind substantial gambling debts. Colonel Forster estimated that it would take over a thousand pounds to settle what Wickham owed in Brighton. He had significant debts in the town, but his gambling debts were even more serious.

Mrs. Gardiner left still feeling bewildered about Elizabeth and her acquaintance from Derbyshire, a confusion that had stayed with her since visiting that area.

Who should suffer but myself? It has been my own doing, and I ought to feel it.”\n“You must not be too severe upon yourself,” replied Elizabeth.\n“You may well warn me against such an evil. Human nature is so prone to fall into it! No, Lizzy, let me once in my life feel how much I have been to blame. I am not afraid of being overpowered by the impression. It will pass away soon enough.”\n“Do you suppose them to be in London?”\n“Yes; where else can they be so well concealed?”\n“And Lydia used to want to go to London,” added Kitty.\n“She is happy, then,” said her father, drily; “and her residence there will probably be of some duration.”\nThen, after a short silence, he continued, “Lizzy, I bear you no ill-will for being justified in your advice to me last May, which, considering the event, shows some greatness of mind.”\nThey were interrupted by Miss Bennet, who came to fetch her mother’s tea.\n“This is a parade,” cried he, “which does one good; it gives such an elegance to misfortune! Another day I will do the same; I will sit in my library, in my nightcap and powdering gown, and give as much trouble as I can,—or perhaps I may defer it till Kitty runs away.”\n“I am not going to run away, papa,” said Kitty, fretfully. “If I should ever go to Brighton, I would behave better than Lydia.”\n“You go to Brighton! I would not trust you so near it as Eastbourne, for fifty pounds! No, Kitty, I have at least learnt to be cautious, and you will feel the effects of it. No officer is ever to enter my house again, nor even to pass through the village. Balls will be absolutely prohibited, unless you stand up with one of your sisters. And you are never to stir out of doors, till you can prove that you have spent ten minutes of every day in a rational manner.”\nKitty, who took all these threats in a serious light, began to cry.\n“Well, well,” said he, “do not make yourself unhappy.

After she briefly expressed sympathy for what he must have gone through, he responded, \"Don't talk about that. Who else should suffer but me? This is my own doing, and I deserve to feel the consequences.\" Elizabeth told him not to be too hard on himself. He replied, \"It's wise of you to caution me against that danger. Human nature is so prone to it! No, Lizzy, for once in my life, let me fully appreciate how much I am at fault. I'm not worried about being overwhelmed by the feeling. It will pass soon enough.\" Elizabeth asked if he thought Lydia and Wickham were in London. \"Yes,\" he answered, \"where else could they hide so effectively?\" Kitty added that Lydia had always wanted to go to London.

Mr. Bennet exclaimed, \"This is a procession that does good; it adds such grace to misfortune! I'll do the same another day; I'll sit in my library, in my nightcap and dressing gown, and cause as much fuss as possible - or maybe I'll postpone it until Kitty elopes.\" \"I'm not going to elope, Papa,\" Kitty said irritably. \"If I ever went to Brighton, I would behave better than Lydia.\" \"You go to Brighton! I wouldn't trust you even as close as Eastbourne, not for fifty pounds! No, Kitty, I have at least learned my lesson, and you will face the repercussions. No officer is ever to enter my house again, or even pass through the village. Balls will be completely forbidden unless you dance only with one of your sisters.

He acknowledged her concern, admitting that people are naturally inclined to dwell on their faults, but insisted that he wanted to feel this sense of guilt fully at least once, and he wasn't worried it would overwhelm him—it would soon fade. \n\nElizabeth then asked if he believed Lydia and Wickham were in London, to which he replied that he did, as it was the best place for them to hide. Kitty commented that Lydia had always wanted to go to London. Mr. Bennet dryly remarked that, in that case, Lydia was content now, and her stay might be lengthy.\n\nAfter a pause, Mr. Bennet told Elizabeth that he didn't blame her for having been right when she advised him last May and that it proved her strength of character. Their conversation was interrupted when Miss Bennet came to get tea for their mother. Mr. Bennet, somewhat sarcastically, remarked how the situation had a sort of elegance to it, as if their misfortune became dignified through such ceremonies. He jokingly said that he'd host similar scenes again in his library, dressed in his nightcap and robe, causing as much inconvenience as possible—or maybe wait until Kitty eloped too.\n\nKitty protested that she wasn't going to run away, and if she ever visited Brighton, she'd behave better than Lydia. Mr. Bennet responded that he wouldn't even let her go as near as Eastbourne, let alone Brighton, and that, having learned to be more careful, he wouldn't allow any officers into the house or the village. He decreed that balls would only be allowed if she danced with a sister and that she would not be allowed outside unless she could prove she spent part of her day sensibly.\n\nKitty, taking his threats seriously, began to cry.

These are conditions which, considering everything, I had no hesitation in complying with, as far as I thought myself privileged, for you.

Mr. Gardiner explained that if Mr. Bennet was willing to uphold the agreements he had made on his behalf, the marriage should happen soon. The requirements were for Mr. Bennet to legally secure Lydia's equal portion of the £5,000 designated for the children after their parents' death, and to commit to giving her £100 annually during his lifetime. Mr. Gardiner felt these terms were reasonable and necessary, and that he was justified in agreeing to them on his brother's behalf. He was sending the letter urgently by express to get a quick reply. He also noted that Wickham's financial state was not as dire as rumoured; he would have some funds left after paying his debts to contribute towards Lydia's settlement, in addition to her own expected inheritance. Mr. Gardiner requested Mr. Bennet grant him full authority to handle the legal process with the solicitor Haggerston for preparing the settlement, assuring him there was no need for him to return to London. He advised Mr. Bennet to remain at Longbourn and trust his diligence, asking for a prompt and clear written response.

His debts to be discharged, and something still to remain! Oh, it must be my uncle’s doings! Generous, good man, I am afraid he has distressed himself.

Meanwhile, Mrs. Bennet decided to visit relatives and friends in town to share the good news and told Kitty to get the carriage ready, also asking Mrs. Hill and the servants to celebrate.

This son was to join in cutting off the entail, as soon as he should be of age, and the widow and younger children would by that means be provided for. Five daughters successively entered the world, but yet the son was to come; and Mrs. Bennet, for many years after Lydia’s birth, had been certain that he would. This event had at last been despaired of, but it was then too late to be saving. Mrs. Bennet had no turn for economy; and her husband’s love of independence had alone prevented their exceeding their income.\nFive thousand pounds was settled by marriage articles on Mrs. Bennet and the children. But in what proportions it should be divided amongst the latter depended on the will of the parents. This was one point, with regard to Lydia at least, which was now to be settled, and Mr. Bennet could have no hesitation in acceding to the proposal before him. In terms of grateful acknowledgment for the kindness of his brother, though expressed most concisely, he then delivered on paper his perfect approbation of all that was done, and his willingness to fulfil the engagements that had been made for him. He had never before supposed that, could Wickham be prevailed on to marry his daughter, it would be done with so little inconvenience to himself as by the present arrangement. He would scarcely be ten pounds a year the loser, by the hundred that was to be paid them; for, what with her board and pocket allowance, and the continual presents in money which passed to her through her mother’s hands, Lydia’s expenses had been very little within that sum.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "Initially, when Mr. Bennet married, they believed financial caution was unnecessary because they were sure to have a son. This son was intended to cooperate in breaking the entailment once he came of age, ensuring the financial support of his widowed mother and younger siblings. However, five daughters were born one after another, and the anticipated son never appeared. Nevertheless, for many years after Lydia's birth, Mrs. Bennet remained convinced a son would arrive. Eventually, this hope was abandoned, but by then it was too late to begin saving. Mrs. Bennet lacked any tendency towards frugality; only her husband's strong desire for independence prevented them from exceeding their income.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "At the time Mr. Bennet got married, they saw no need to be frugal because they believed they would have a son who would help break the entail on their estate once he came of age, ensuring the family’s future. As each of their five daughters was born, they still expected a son to arrive, and for many years after their youngest, Lydia, was born, Mrs. Bennet remained convinced one would come. Eventually, they had to give up hope, but by then it was too late to start saving. Mrs. Bennet was never interested in managing money, and it was only Mr. Bennet’s preference for independence that kept them from spending more than they earned.\nA sum of five thousand pounds had been secured for Mrs. Bennet and their children in the marriage agreements, but how it was to be divided among the children was left to the Bennets’ discretion. Now, regarding Lydia, this point needed to be decided, and Mr. Bennet readily agreed to the suggested plan. He wrote a brief but thankful note approving the proposal and agreeing to the commitments made on his behalf. He had never imagined that persuading Wickham to marry his daughter could be arranged with so little trouble or cost to himself as in this current agreement. The annual payment he would lose amounted to less than ten pounds, since Lydia’s living and spending money, plus the money from Mrs. Bennet, had previously cost them nearly that much already."

He asked for more information about what he still owed his brother, but was too annoyed with Lydia to send her any message. The joyful news rapidly made its way through the household, and soon spread just as quickly throughout the neighborhood.

She often thought how satisfying it would be for him if he knew she would now have welcomed the proposal she rejected only a few months ago. She believed him to be as generous as any man, but as a human being, knowing her change of heart would be a victory for him. Elizabeth now saw that Darcy was the very man whose character would most suit her. Their differences in understanding and temperament would have balanced each other perfectly, making a marriage that would benefit them both: her cheerful manner might have softened his character and improved his behavior, and in turn, she would have gained much from his wisdom, experience, and knowledge of the world.

To Mr. Bennet’s acknowledgments he briefly replied, with assurances of his eagerness to promote the welfare of any of his family; and concluded with entreaties that the subject might never be mentioned to him again. The principal purport of his letter was to inform them, that Mr. Wickham had resolved on quitting the militia.\n“It was greatly my wish that he should do so,” he added, “as soon as his marriage was fixed on.

Lydia’s being settled in the north, just when she had expected most pleasure and pride in her company, for she had by no means given up her plan of their residing in Hertfordshire, was a severe disappointment; and, besides, it was such a pity that Lydia should be taken from a regiment where she was acquainted with everybody, and had so many favourites.\n“She is so fond of Mrs. Forster,” said she, “it will be quite shocking to send her away! And there are several of the young men, too, that she likes very much. The officers may not be so pleasant in General——’s regiment.”\nHis daughter’s request, for such it might be considered, of being admitted into her family again, before she set off for the north, received at first an absolute negative. But Jane and Elizabeth, who agreed in wishing, for the sake of their sister’s feelings and consequence, that she should be noticed on her marriage by her parents, urged him so earnestly, yet so rationally and so mildly, to receive her and her husband at Longbourn, as soon as they were married, that he was prevailed on to think as they thought, and act as they wished. And their mother had the satisfaction of knowing, that she should be able to show her married daughter in the neighbourhood, before she was banished to the north. When Mr. Bennet wrote again to his brother, therefore, he sent his permission for them to come; and it was settled, that, as soon as the ceremony was over, they should proceed to Longbourn.

The main purpose of his letter was to inform them that Mr. Wickham had decided to leave the militia. \"It was very much my desire that he should do this,\" he added, \"as soon as his marriage was arranged.

And their mother was satisfied knowing she would be able to display her married daughter in the neighborhood before she was sent away to the north. Therefore, when Mr. Bennet wrote to his brother again, he sent his permission for them to come; and it was settled that, as soon as the ceremony was over, they would go straight to Longbourn.

The main message of his letter was to say that Wickham had decided to leave the militia. Mr. Gardiner stated that this was what he had wanted as soon as the marriage was settled and thought everyone would agree that Wickham’s leaving was wise for both him and Lydia. Wickham planned to join the Regulars, and still had friends in the army willing to help him. He had been promised a position as an ensign in a regiment stationed in the north of England, which Mr. Gardiner considered advantageous since it was far from their current home. Mr. Gardiner hoped that, with new surroundings and reputations to uphold, both would act more sensibly. He had informed Colonel Forster of these plans and asked him to assure Wickham’s creditors in Brighton of prompt payment (for which Mr. Gardiner had guaranteed), and asked Mr. Bennet to do the same for creditors in Meryton. Wickham had listed all his debts, and Mr. Gardiner hoped there were no omissions. Arrangements were underway and would be finished within a week.

Nothing of the past was recollected with pain; and Lydia led voluntarily to subjects which her sisters would not have alluded to for the world.\n“Only think of its being three months,” she cried, “since I went away: it seems but a fortnight, I declare; and yet there have been things enough happened in the time. Good gracious! when I went away, I am sure I had no more idea of being married till I came back again! though I thought it would be very good fun if I was.”\nHer father lifted up his eyes, Jane was distressed, Elizabeth looked expressively at Lydia; but she, who never heard nor saw anything of which she chose to be insensible, gaily continued,—\n“Oh, mamma, do the people hereabouts know I am married to-day?

Everyone seemed to remember only the pleasantest moments; no one dwelled on painful memories from the past, and Lydia eagerly brought up topics her sisters would never have mentioned. \n\n\"Just imagine, it's been three months since I left!\" Lydia exclaimed. \"It feels like only two weeks—so much has happened in that time. Honestly, when I left, I had no thought of getting married before I returned—though I thought it would be a lot of fun if I did.\"\n\nMr. Bennet looked up, Jane was uncomfortable, and Elizabeth gave Lydia a meaningful glance. But Lydia, oblivious to hints and corrections as usual, cheerfully continued,\n\n\"Oh, Mama, does everyone around here know I got married today? I was worried they didn't, but when we passed William Goulding in his carriage, I made sure he saw my wedding ring. I put my hand on the window so he couldn't possibly miss it, smiled, and waved at him.\"\n\nElizabeth couldn't take any more and abruptly left the room, not returning until she heard the others heading towards the dining room. Coming back in, she saw Lydia ostentatiously take the place at her mother's right and announce to Jane,\n\n\"Now, Jane, I outrank you—I'm a married woman, so you must move down the table.\""

Isn't he absolutely wonderful? I'm certain my sisters are envious of me. I just hope they experience half the good fortune I have. They really must go to Brighton. That's the perfect place to find husbands. It's such a shame, Mother, that we didn't all go!\" \"That's very true; and if it were up to me, we would have. But, my dear Lydia, I'm not at all happy about you moving so far away. Is that unavoidable?\" \"Oh, goodness! Yes, of course; there's nothing difficult about that. I'll absolutely love it. You, Father, and my sisters must come visit us. We'll be in Newcastle throughout the winter, and I'm sure there will be some dances, and I'll make sure they all get excellent partners.\" \"I couldn't wish for anything more!\" her mother responded. \"And then, when you leave, you can let one or two of my sisters stay behind; and I'm quite sure I'll find husbands for them before the winter is over.\" \"Thank you for considering me,\" Elizabeth said, \"but I don't particularly approve of your method for finding husbands.\" Their visitors were not staying for more than ten days. Mr. Wickham had received his military commission before leaving London and was scheduled to join his regiment at the end of two weeks. Only Mrs. Bennet was disappointed by the brevity of their visit; she made the most of the limited time by accompanying her daughter on visits to others and hosting frequent gatherings at their home.

Lydia reassured her that it would be wonderful and invited the whole family to visit them in Newcastle over the winter, promising there would be balls and that she would secure good dance partners for her sisters.\n\nMrs. Bennet said she would love nothing more. Lydia then joked they could leave one or two sisters with her, and she’d find them husbands before winter ended.\n\nElizabeth dryly replied that she was grateful for Lydia’s offer, but did not like her approach to matchmaking.\n\nThe Wickhams would stay less than ten days, as Mr. Wickham received his posting before leaving London and would join his regiment in two weeks.

She had scarcely needed her present observation to be satisfied, from the reason of things, that their elopement had been brought on by the strength of her love rather than by his; and she would have wondered why, without violently caring for her, he chose to elope with her at all, had she not felt certain that his flight was rendered necessary by distress of circumstances; and if that were the case, he was not the young man to resist an opportunity of having a companion.\nLydia was exceedingly fond of him. He was her dear Wickham on every occasion; no one was to be put in competition with him. He did everything best in the world; and she was sure he would kill more birds on the first of September than anybody else in the country.\nOne morning, soon after their arrival, as she was sitting with her two elder sisters, she said to Elizabeth,—\n“Lizzy, I never gave you an account of my wedding, I believe. You were not by, when I told mamma, and the others, all about it. Are not you curious to hear how it was managed?”\n“No, really,” replied Elizabeth; “I think there cannot be too little said on the subject.”\n“La! You are so strange! But I must tell you how it went off. We were married, you know, at St. Clement’s, because Wickham’s lodgings were in that parish. And it was settled that we should all be there by eleven o’clock. My uncle and aunt and I were to go together; and the others were to meet us at the church.\n“Well, Monday morning came, and I was in such a fuss! I was so afraid, you know, that something would happen to put it off, and then I should have gone quite distracted. And there was my aunt, all the time I was dressing, preaching and talking away just as if she was reading a sermon. However, I did not hear above one word in ten, for I was thinking, you may suppose, of my dear Wickham. I longed to know whether he would be married in his blue coat.\n“Well, and so we breakfasted at ten as usual: I thought it would never be over; for, by the bye, you are to understand that my uncle and aunt were horrid unpleasant all the time I was with them. If you’ll believe me, I did not once put my foot out of doors, though I was there a fortnight. Not one party, or scheme, or anything! To be sure, London was rather thin, but, however, the Little Theatre was open.\n“Well, and so, just as the carriage came to the door, my uncle was called away upon business to that horrid man Mr. Stone. And then, you know, when once they get together, there is no end of it. Well, I was so frightened I did not know what to do, for my uncle was to give me away; and if we were beyond the hour we could not be married all day. But, luckily, he came back again in ten minutes’ time, and then we all set out. However, I recollected afterwards, that if he had been prevented going, the wedding need not be put off, for Mr. Darcy might have done as well.”\n“Mr. Darcy!” repeated Elizabeth, in utter amazement.\n“Oh, yes! he was to come there with Wickham, you know. But, gracious me! I quite forgot! I ought not to have said a word about it. I promised them so faithfully! What will Wickham say? It was to be such a secret!”",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "Elizabeth observed that Wickham's feelings for Lydia were precisely as she had anticipated – less intense than Lydia's devotion to him. Based on her understanding, she hardly needed this current observation to conclude that their elopement was driven more by the depth of Lydia's love than his. She might have wondered why he bothered to run off with her at all, given his lack of strong affection, if she hadn't been convinced that his desperate financial situation necessitated his sudden departure. If that were the case, he wouldn't be the type to pass up the chance for a companion. Lydia was exceptionally smitten with him, referring to him as 'her dear Wickham' constantly. No one could compare to him in her eyes; he was the best at everything in the world. She was utterly certain he would shoot more birds on the first of September than anyone else in the entire country. One morning, not long after they arrived home, as she was seated with her two older sisters, she turned to Elizabeth and said, \"Lizzy, I don't think I ever told you about my wedding. You weren't there when I described it all to Mama and the others. Aren't you eager to hear how it all happened?\" \"No, truthfully,\" Elizabeth responded, \"I believe the less said about the subject, the better.\" \"Good heavens! You are so peculiar! But I simply must tell you how it went. We got married, you see, at St. Clement’s church because Wickham was lodging in that parish. And it was decided we should all be there by eleven o'clock. My uncle, my aunt, and I were to go together, and the rest were to meet us at the church.\" \"Well, Monday morning arrived, and I was in such a state! I was so terribly afraid, you know, that something would happen to delay it, and then I would have utterly lost my mind. And my aunt was there the whole time I was getting dressed, lecturing and talking incessantly, as if she were delivering a sermon. However, I barely heard a word, perhaps one in ten, because, as you can imagine, I was preoccupied with thoughts of my dear Wickham. I was dying to know if he would be married in his blue coat.\" \"Anyway, we had breakfast at ten as usual. I thought it would never end, because, by the way, you should know that my uncle and aunt were dreadfully unpleasant the entire time I stayed with them. Believe it or not, I didn't step outside once, even though I was there for two weeks. Not a single social gathering, excursion, or anything! To be fair, London wasn't very full, but the Little Theatre was open, at least.\" \"So then, just as the carriage pulled up, my uncle was called away on business to see that dreadful Mr. Stone. And you know how it is, once they get together, it's endless. Well, I was so panicked, I didn't know what to do, because my uncle was supposed to give me away, and if we missed the hour, we couldn't get married that day. But, thankfully, he returned in just ten minutes, and then we all left. However, I remembered afterwards that if he had been prevented from going, the wedding wouldn't have needed to be postponed, because Mr. Darcy could have done it just as well.\"",

Elizabeth needed little evidence to conclude from the circumstances that the elopement was caused more by Lydia's affection than Wickham's. She might have wondered why Wickham ran away with Lydia if he didn't care for her strongly, except she was convinced his financial troubles forced him to leave, and in that case, he would not miss the chance for companionship. Lydia, on her part, was deeply attached to Wickham; she adored him above everyone, believing he excelled at everything and was certain he would outdo all others in shooting on the first of September. Shortly after arriving, Lydia, while sitting with Elizabeth and Jane, excitedly began to recount the details of her wedding, despite Elizabeth displaying no real interest. Lydia described being married at St. Clement's, in Wickham's parish, and all the arrangements for the wedding morning. She recalled her nerves, her aunt's constant advice while she dressed, and how dull her time with her uncle and aunt had been. She expressed her fear when her uncle was delayed right before the ceremony but relief when he returned just in time. Lydia also noted, as an afterthought, that if her uncle hadn’t returned, Mr. Darcy could have taken his place in giving her away. Elizabeth was astonished to hear Mr. Darcy mentioned, but Lydia, realizing she'd revealed a promised secret, was suddenly worried about what Wickham would say."

Mr. Darcy had been at her sister’s wedding. It was exactly a scene, and exactly among people, where he had apparently least to do, and least temptation to go. Conjectures as to the meaning of it, rapid and wild, hurried into her brain; but she was satisfied with none. Those that best pleased her, as placing his conduct in the noblest light, seemed most improbable. She could not bear such suspense; and hastily seizing a sheet of paper, wrote a short letter to her aunt, to request an explanation of what Lydia had dropped, if it were compatible with the secrecy which had been intended.\n“You may readily comprehend,” she added, “what my curiosity must be to know how a person unconnected with any of us, and, comparatively speaking, a stranger to our family, should have been amongst you at such a time. Pray write instantly, and let me understand it—unless it is, for very cogent reasons, to remain in the secrecy which Lydia seems to think necessary; and then I must endeavour to be satisfied with ignorance.”\n“Not that I shall, though,” she added to herself, and she finished the letter; “and, my dear aunt, if you do not tell me in an honourable manner, I shall certainly be reduced to tricks and stratagems to find it out.”\nJane’s delicate sense of honour would not allow her to speak to Elizabeth privately of what Lydia had let fall; Elizabeth was glad of it:—till it appeared whether her inquiries would receive any satisfaction, she had rather be without a confidante.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "\"If it was intended to be a secret,\" Jane stated, \"don't speak another word on the topic. You can trust that I will not attempt to discover more.\" \"Oh, absolutely,\" Elizabeth replied, though intensely curious; \"we won't ask you anything.\" \"Thank you,\" said Lydia, \"because if you did, I would definitely tell you everything, and then Wickham would be very angry.\" This comment, acting as an invitation to ask, compelled Elizabeth to remove herself from the situation by quickly leaving, putting it out of her power to question Lydia further. However, living in ignorance on such a matter was unbearable; or at least, it was impossible not to seek information. Mr. Darcy had attended her sister's wedding. This setting, among these people, was precisely where he seemed to have the least reason to be involved and the fewest incentives to go. Swift and wild speculations about the meaning of this event flooded her mind, but none felt satisfactory. The hypotheses that presented his actions most favourably seemed the least likely to be true. She couldn't tolerate the uncertainty. Quickly taking a sheet of paper, she wrote a brief letter to her aunt, asking for an explanation of what Lydia had mentioned, if it didn't conflict with the required secrecy. \"You can easily understand,\" she added in the letter, \"how curious I must be to know why someone completely unconnected to any of us, and relatively a stranger to our family, was present among you at that time. Please write back immediately and clarify—unless there are very strong reasons for it to remain confidential, as Lydia seems to believe is necessary; in that case, I must try to accept being uninformed.\" \"Not that I will accept it, though,\" she added to herself, finishing the letter. \"And, my dear aunt,\" she mused internally, \"if you don't inform me honestly, I will certainly be forced to use deceptive means and tricks to find out.\" Jane's refined sense of honour prevented her from discussing privately with Elizabeth what Lydia had accidentally revealed; Elizabeth was content with this. Until she saw whether her own inquiries would yield any satisfaction, she preferred not to have a confidante.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "Jane said, \"If it's supposed to be a secret, let's not discuss it any further. You can trust I won't try to find out more.\" Elizabeth, though filled with curiosity, replied, \"Of course; we won't question you.\" Lydia thanked them, saying that if they did ask, she'd probably confess everything, and that would upset Wickham. Given such a temptation to pry, Elizabeth made herself leave the room so she wouldn't press Lydia. Still, Elizabeth found it impossible to remain ignorant on the matter, or at least she couldn't help but try to find out. She was particularly struck by Mr. Darcy's presence at her sister's wedding—a place and event where he seemed to have the least reason or desire to be. Thoughts and theories raced through her mind, but none felt satisfactory. Even the explanations she liked best, which put Darcy in the best light, seemed unlikely. Unable to tolerate the uncertainty, she quickly wrote a letter to her aunt, asking for clarification about what Lydia had hinted at, unless secrecy was absolutely necessary. She wrote, \"You can imagine how much I want to know why someone nearly a stranger, with no ties to us, was there with you at such an important moment. Please write back right away and explain—unless Lydia’s secrecy is truly vital; then I’ll attempt to live without the knowledge.\" To herself, though, Elizabeth admitted she would not really be content in ignorance, and joked that if not told honestly, she’d resort to schemes to discover the truth. Out of respect for Jane's sense of honor, neither she nor Jane discussed Lydia's revelation privately, which pleased Elizabeth until she knew whether her inquiry to her aunt would provide any answers; she preferred not to confide in anyone yet."

I must confess myself surprised by your application; I did not expect it from you. Don’t think me angry, however, for I only mean to let you know, that I had not imagined such inquiries to be necessary on your side. If you do not choose to understand me, forgive my impertinence. Your uncle is as much surprised as I am; and nothing but the belief of your being a party concerned would have allowed him to act as he has done. But if you are really innocent and ignorant, I must be more explicit. On the very day of my coming home from Longbourn, your uncle had a most unexpected visitor. Mr. Darcy called, and was shut up with him several hours. It was all over before I arrived; so my curiosity was not so dreadfully racked as yours seems to have been. He came to tell Mr. Gardiner that he had found out where your sister and Mr. Wickham were, and that he had seen and talked with them both—Wickham repeatedly, Lydia once. From what I can collect, he left Derbyshire only one day after ourselves, and came to town with the resolution of hunting for them. The motive professed was his conviction of its being owing to himself that Wickham’s worthlessness had not been so well known as to make it impossible for any young woman of character to love or confide in him. He generously imputed the whole to his mistaken pride, and confessed that he had before thought it beneath him to lay his private actions open to the world. His character was to speak for itself. He called it, therefore, his duty to step forward, and endeavour to remedy an evil which had been brought on by himself. If he had another motive, I am sure it would never disgrace him. He had been some days in town before he was able to discover them; but he had something to direct his search, which was more than we had; and the consciousness of this was another reason for his resolving to follow us. There is a lady, it seems, a Mrs. Younge, who was some time ago governess to Miss Darcy, and was dismissed from her charge on some cause of disapprobation, though he did not say what. She then took a large house in Edward Street, and has since maintained herself by letting lodgings. This Mrs. Younge was, he knew, intimately acquainted with Wickham; and he went to her for intelligence of him, as soon as he got to town. But it was two or three days before he could get from her what he wanted. She would not betray her trust, I suppose, without bribery and corruption, for she really did know where her friend was to be found. Wickham, indeed, had gone to her on their first arrival in London; and had she been able to receive them into her house, they would have taken up their abode with her.",

My dear Niece, I've just received your letter and plan to spend this entire morning writing back, as I realize a short response won't cover everything I need to tell you. I must admit your inquiry took me by surprise; I hadn't anticipated hearing from you in this way. Please don't mistake my surprise for anger; I simply mean that I didn't think you would need to ask these questions. If you choose not to understand my implication, please excuse my forwardness. Your uncle is just as surprised as I am; only believing you were somehow involved could explain his actions. However, if you are truly innocent and unaware, I need to be more explicit. On the very day I returned home from Longbourn, your uncle had a most unexpected visitor. Mr. Darcy came and spent several hours discussing matters privately with him. It was all finished before I arrived, so my curiosity wasn't nearly as tormented as yours seems to be. He informed Mr. Gardiner that he had located your sister and Mr. Wickham, and that he had spoken with both of them—with Wickham multiple times, and with Lydia once. As far as I can gather, he left Derbyshire just one day after we did and came to London determined to find them. The reason he gave was his belief that it was his own fault that Wickham's poor character wasn't widely known enough to prevent any respectable young woman from falling for him or trusting him. He generously blamed the entire situation on his own misguided pride, admitting that he had previously thought it beneath him to reveal his personal conduct to the world. He felt his reputation should stand on its own. Therefore, he stated it was his duty to step in and try to fix a problem he felt he had caused. If he had any other reason, I am confident it would be nothing dishonorable. He was in town for a few days before he managed to find them; but he had a certain clue to guide his search, which was more than we had; and knowing this was another factor in his decision to follow us. There is a lady, apparently, a Mrs. Younge, who used to be Miss Darcy's governess some time ago and was dismissed for undisclosed reasons he didn't specify. She subsequently leased a large house in Edward Street and has since made a living by renting rooms. Mr. Darcy knew this Mrs. Younge was well-acquainted with Wickham; and he contacted her for information about him as soon as he arrived in town. But it took him two or three days to get the information he needed from her. I suspect she wouldn't betray her knowledge without some form of payment or persuasion, because she genuinely knew where her friend was. Indeed, Wickham had gone to her upon their initial arrival in London; and if she had been able to accommodate them, they would have stayed at her house.",

My dear niece, I’ve just received your letter and I intend to spend this entire morning replying, because it will take more than a brief note to explain everything. Honestly, I’m surprised you reached out to me; I didn’t expect this from you. Don’t think I’m upset—I'm only surprised, since I hadn’t thought you’d need to ask me these questions. If I’m being presumptuous, please forgive me. Your uncle is just as astonished as I am; he only acted as he did because he believed you had a personal involvement. If, however, you’re truly unaware and innocent in this matter, I need to give you more details. On the very day I returned from Longbourn, your uncle received a very unexpected visit from Mr. Darcy, who spent several hours alone with him.

She later took a large house in Edward Street and has made a living renting out rooms. Darcy knew Mrs. Younge was close to Wickham, so he approached her for information as soon as he got to town. It took him two or three days to persuade her to share what she knew. She probably wouldn’t have revealed anything without being bribed, because she really did know where he could find Wickham. In fact, Wickham had approached her when he and Lydia first got to London, and if she had been able to accommodate them, they would’ve stayed with her."

His first object with her, he acknowledged, had been to persuade her to quit her present disgraceful situation, and return to her friends as soon as they could be prevailed on to receive her, offering his assistance as far as it would go. But he found Lydia absolutely resolved on remaining where she was. She cared for none of her friends; she wanted no help of his; she would not hear of leaving Wickham. She was sure they should be married some time or other, and it did not much signify when. Since such were her feelings, it only remained, he thought, to secure and expedite a marriage, which, in his very first conversation with Wickham, he easily learnt had never been his design. He confessed himself obliged to leave the regiment on account of some debts of honour which were very pressing; and scrupled not to lay all the ill consequences of Lydia’s flight on her own folly alone. He meant to resign his commission immediately; and as to his future situation, he could conjecture very little about it. He must go somewhere, but he did not know where, and he knew he should have nothing to live on. Mr. Darcy asked why he did not marry your sister at once. Though Mr. Bennet was not imagined to be very rich, he would have been able to do something for him, and his situation must have been benefited by marriage. But he found, in reply to this question, that Wickham still cherished the hope of more effectually making his fortune by marriage, in some other country. Under such circumstances, however, he was not likely to be proof against the temptation of immediate relief. They met several times, for there was much to be discussed. Wickham, of course, wanted more than he could get; but at length was reduced to be reasonable. Everything being settled between them, Mr. Darcy’s next step was to make your uncle acquainted with it, and he first called in Gracechurch Street the evening before I came home.",

He admitted that his primary goal with her had been to persuade her to leave her current disreputable situation and go back to her family as soon as they could be convinced to accept her, offering whatever assistance he could provide. However, he discovered that Lydia was absolutely determined to stay put. She showed no concern for any of her friends, refused his help, and would not consider leaving Wickham. She was confident they would get married eventually and didn't see the timing as very important. Given her feelings, he concluded that the only remaining course of action was to secure and speed up a marriage, which he quickly learned in his first conversation with Wickham had never been Wickham's intention. Wickham confessed he was forced to leave his military unit because of some pressing gambling debts and did not hesitate to place all the negative consequences of Lydia's running away solely on her own foolishness. He intended to resign his commission immediately, and regarding his future, he had very little idea. He knew he had to go somewhere but didn't know where, and he realized he would have no money to live on. Mr. Darcy inquired why he didn't simply marry her sister right away. Although Mr. Bennet was not thought to be wealthy, he could have offered some support, and marriage would have improved Wickham's circumstances. But in response to this question, he found that Wickham still held onto the hope of making a better fortune through marriage in another country. Despite these hopes, however, he was unlikely to resist the lure of immediate financial relief. They had several meetings as there was much to discuss. Naturally, Wickham wanted more than he was offered, but he finally became willing to compromise.

She was confident they would marry eventually, and did not care when that happened. Given her attitude, he felt the only option was to secure and hasten a marriage, which he quickly learned was never Wickham’s intention when he spoke with him.

He did not judge your father to be a person whom he could so properly consult as your uncle, and therefore readily postponed seeing him till after the departure of the former. He did not leave his name, and till the next day it was only known that a gentleman had called on business. On Saturday he came again. Your father was gone, your uncle at home, and, as I said before, they had a great deal of talk together. They met again on Sunday, and then I saw him too. It was not all settled before Monday: as soon as it was, the express was sent off to Longbourn. But our visitor was very obstinate. I fancy, Lizzy, that obstinacy is the real defect of his character, after all. He has been accused of many faults at different times; but this is the true one. Nothing was to be done that he did not do himself; though I am sure (and I do not speak it to be thanked, therefore say nothing about it) your uncle would most readily have settled the whole. They battled it together for a long time, which was more than either the gentleman or lady concerned in it deserved. But at last your uncle was forced to yield, and instead of being allowed to be of use to his niece, was forced to put up with only having the probable credit of it, which went sorely against the grain; and I really believe your letter this morning gave him great pleasure, because it required an explanation that would rob him of his borrowed feathers, and give the praise where it was due. But, Lizzy, this must go no further than yourself, or Jane at most. You know pretty well, I suppose, what has been done for the young people. His debts are to be paid, amounting, I believe, to considerably more than a thousand pounds, another thousand in addition to her own settled upon her, and his commission purchased. The reason why all this was to be done by him alone, was such as I have given above. It was owing to him, to his reserve and want of proper consideration, that Wickham’s character had been so misunderstood, and consequently that he had been received and noticed as he was. Perhaps there was some truth in this; though I doubt whether his reserve, or anybody’s reserve can be answerable for the event. But in spite of all this fine talking, my dear Lizzy, you may rest perfectly assured that your uncle would never have yielded, if we had not given him credit for another interest in the affair. When all this was resolved on, he returned again to his friends, who were still staying at Pemberley; but it was agreed that he should be in London once more when the wedding took place, and all money matters were then to receive the last finish. I believe I have now told you everything. It is a relation which you tell me is to give you great surprise; I hope at least it will not afford you any displeasure. Lydia came to us, and Wickham had constant admission to the house. He was exactly what he had been when I knew him in Hertfordshire; but I would not tell you how little I was satisfied with her behaviour while she stayed with us, if I had not perceived, by Jane’s letter last Wednesday, that her conduct on coming home was exactly of a piece with it, and therefore what I now tell you can give you no fresh pain. I talked to her repeatedly in the most serious manner, representing to her the wickedness of what she had done, and all the unhappiness she had brought on her family. If she heard me, it was by good luck, for I am sure she did not listen. I was sometimes quite provoked; but then I recollected my dear Elizabeth and Jane, and for their sakes had patience with her. Mr. Darcy was punctual in his return, and, as Lydia imformed you, attended the wedding. He dined with us the next day, and was to leave town again on Wednesday or Thursday. Will you be very angry with me, my dear Lizzy, if I take this opportunity of saying (what I was never bold enough to say before) how much I like him? His behaviour to us has, in every respect, been as pleasing as when we were in Derbyshire. His understanding and opinions all please me; he wants nothing but a little more liveliness, and that, if he marry prudently, his wife may teach him. I thought him very sly; he hardly ever mentioned your name. But slyness seems the fashion. Pray forgive me, if I have been very presuming, or at least do not punish me so far as to exclude me from P. I shall never be quite happy till I have been all round the park. A low phaeton with a nice little pair of ponies would be the very thing. But I must write no more. The children have been wanting me this half hour.\n“Yours, very sincerely,\n“M. Gardiner.”",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "However, Mr. Gardiner was unavailable, and Mr. Darcy learned upon asking further that your father was still with him but intended to depart the following morning. He felt it would be more appropriate to discuss matters with your uncle than your father, so he readily decided to postpone seeing him until after your father had left. He did not give his name, and until the next day, it was merely known that a gentleman had visited on business. He returned on Saturday. Your father had departed, your uncle was home, and as I mentioned earlier, they engaged in a lengthy conversation. They met again on Sunday, at which point I also saw Mr. Darcy. Everything wasn't finalized until Monday; as soon as it was, the messenger was dispatched to Longbourn. But our visitor proved very stubborn. I suspect, Lizzy, that stubbornness is truly the main flaw in his character, despite being accused of various faults over time; this is the accurate one. He insisted on handling everything himself; though I assure you (and I say this not for thanks, so please do not respond) your uncle would have been perfectly willing to manage the entire situation. They debated the points for a considerable time, which seemed more effort than either the gentleman or lady involved truly warranted. Ultimately, your uncle was compelled to concede, and instead of being able to directly assist his niece, he had to settle for merely the probable credit for the outcome, which was quite displeasing to him. I genuinely believe your letter this morning brought him significant pleasure because it necessitated an explanation that would reveal Mr. Darcy as the person responsible, thus giving credit where it was due. However, Lizzy, this information must remain confidential between you and Jane, at the very most. I presume you are reasonably aware of the arrangements made for the young couple. His debts are to be paid, amounting, I understand, to well over a thousand pounds, another thousand pounds are settled on her in addition to her existing funds, and his army commission has been purchased. The justification he gave for handling all of this alone was as I mentioned earlier. He attributed it to himself, to his reserved nature and lack of proper consideration, which had caused Wickham's reputation to be misunderstood, and as a consequence, he had been received and welcomed as he was. Perhaps there is some truth in this; although I doubt whether his reserve, or anyone's reserve, can genuinely be held accountable for what happened. But despite all this elaborate explanation, my dear Lizzy, you can be absolutely certain that your uncle would never have agreed unless we had given him credit for having another interest in the matter. Once everything was decided, he returned to his friends, who were still staying at Pemberley; but it was agreed he would come back to London one more time when the wedding occurred, at which point all financial details would be finalized. I believe I have now informed you of everything. You mentioned this story would surprise you greatly; I hope, at least, it does not cause you any distress. Lydia and Wickham came to stay with us, and he had unrestricted access to the house. He was exactly the same as when I knew him in Hertfordshire; but I would not have told you how dissatisfied I was with her conduct while she was with us, had I not realized, from Jane's letter last Wednesday, that her behaviour upon returning home was perfectly consistent with it, and therefore what I tell you now cannot cause you fresh pain. I spoke to her seriously multiple times, explaining the wrongness of her actions and all the unhappiness she had inflicted upon her family. If she heard me, it was by chance, as I am certain she did not truly listen. I was sometimes quite irritated; but then I remembered my dear Elizabeth and Jane, and for their sake, I was patient with her. Mr. Darcy returned punctually and, as Lydia informed you, attended the wedding. He dined with us the next day and was planning to leave town again on Wednesday or Thursday. Will you be very upset with me, my dear Lizzy, if I take this chance to say (something I have never dared to say before) how much I find myself liking him? His conduct towards us has been entirely as pleasant as it was when we were in Derbyshire. I find his understanding and opinions all pleasing; he lacks nothing except a little more animation, and that, if he chooses a wife wisely, his wife may be able to teach him. I thought he was very subtle; he hardly ever mentioned your name. But subtlety seems to be in style nowadays. Please forgive me if I have been very forward, or at least do not punish me by barring me from P. I shall never be completely content until I have explored the entire park. A small carriage with a nice pair of ponies would be absolutely ideal for that. But I must stop writing now. The children have been asking for me for the past half hour.\n“Sincerely yours,\n“M. Gardiner.”",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "Mr. Gardiner was not available when Mr. Darcy first tried to visit, and after checking further, Mr. Darcy discovered that your father was still with Mr. Gardiner but would be leaving town the next morning. Since Mr. Darcy felt that your father was not as appropriate to consult as your uncle, he decided to wait until your father left before meeting Mr. Gardiner. He didn’t leave his name, so initially, no one knew who the gentleman caller was. The next Saturday, he came back—your father had left and your uncle was home, and they had a long discussion as I mentioned before. They met again Sunday, and I also saw him at that time. The matter wasn’t finalized until Monday; once it was settled, a message was sent to Longbourn. Our visitor was very stubborn, Lizzy; I think stubbornness is his main flaw, even though people have accused him of other faults. He insisted on handling everything himself, although, honestly (and please don’t mention it), your uncle would have happily taken care of everything. They argued over it for quite some time, which was more effort than either Mr. Wickham or Lydia really deserved. In the end, your uncle had to give in and was only allowed to get the credit for helping, which he found disappointing. I think your letter this morning pleased him, as it gave him a chance to clarify who really deserved the praise. But please, Lizzy, keep this between yourself and maybe Jane. You likely know what has been done for Lydia and Wickham: all his debts, which are over a thousand pounds, are to be paid, another thousand pounds given to Lydia in addition to her own, and Wickham’s commission arranged for. The reason Darcy alone arranged all this is explained above—since his own lack of openness allowed Wickham’s character to be misunderstood and accepted as it was. There’s some truth in that, although I am not certain that anyone’s reserve can justify what happened. Despite all this, trust me, your uncle would not have given in unless he thought there was another motive at work. After everything was agreed on, Mr. Darcy returned to his friends at Pemberley but planned to come back to London for the wedding and to finalize the financial details. I believe I’ve told you everything—it’s a surprising story for you, but I hope it does not upset you. Lydia stayed with us, and Wickham visited often. He behaved the same as when I met him in Hertfordshire, but I was dissatisfied with Lydia’s behavior during her stay. However, since Jane’s letter shows Lydia behaved the same upon returning home, my telling you will not be new or painful. I repeatedly spoke to Lydia seriously about how wrong her actions were and the trouble she brought on her family, but if she heard it, it was by chance—she certainly did not listen. I was often frustrated, but for your and Jane’s sakes, I was patient. Mr. Darcy came back as promised and, as Lydia told you, attended the wedding. He dined with us the next day and planned to leave again midweek. Lizzy, I hope you won’t be angry if I finally say I like him very much—his conduct toward us was as pleasing as it was in Derbyshire. I respect his mind and views; he just needs a bit more cheerfulness, which a sensible wife may teach him. I thought he was discreet—he rarely mentioned you. But such discretion seems common. Please forgive me if I overstep, or at least, don’t punish me by denying me a visit to Pemberley. I’ll never be quite happy until I see the park—a small phaeton and ponies would be perfect for it. I must stop writing now—the children have needed me for half an hour already.\n\"Yours, very sincerely,\nM. Gardiner.\""

          "text_segment": "The contents of this letter threw Elizabeth into a flutter of spirits, in which it was difficult to determine whether pleasure or pain bore the greatest share. The vague and unsettled suspicions which uncertainty had produced, of what Mr. Darcy might have been doing to forward her sister’s match—which she had feared to encourage, as an exertion of goodness too great to be probable, and at the same time dreaded to be just, from the pain of obligation—were proved beyond their greatest extent to be true! He had followed them purposely to town, he had taken on himself all the trouble and mortification attendant on such a research; in which supplication had been necessary to a woman whom he must abominate and despise, and where he was reduced to meet, frequently meet, reason with, persuade, and finally bribe the man whom he always most wished to avoid, and whose very name it was punishment to him to pronounce. He had done all this for a girl whom he could neither regard nor esteem. Her heart did whisper that he had done it for her. But it was a hope shortly checked by other considerations; and she soon felt that even her vanity was insufficient, when required to depend on his affection for her, for a woman who had already refused him, as able to overcome a sentiment so natural as abhorrence against relationship with Wickham. Brother-in-law of Wickham! Every kind of pride must revolt from the connection. He had, to be sure, done much. She was ashamed to think how much. But he had given a reason for his interference, which asked no extraordinary stretch of belief. It was reasonable that he should feel he had been wrong; he had liberality, and he had the means of exercising it; and though she would not place herself as his principal inducement, she could perhaps believe, that remaining partiality for her might assist his endeavours in a cause where her peace of mind must be materially concerned. It was painful, exceedingly painful, to know that they were under obligations to a person who could never receive a return. They owed the restoration of Lydia, her character, everything to him. Oh, how heartily did she grieve over every ungracious sensation she had ever encouraged, every saucy speech she had ever directed towards him! For herself she was humbled; but she was proud of him,—proud that in a cause of compassion and honour he had been able to get the better of himself. She read over her aunt’s commendation of him again and again. It was hardly enough; but it pleased her. She was even sensible of some pleasure, though mixed with regret, on finding how steadfastly both she and her uncle had been persuaded that affection and confidence subsisted between Mr. Darcy and herself.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "Upon reading the contents of this letter, Elizabeth experienced a whirlwind of emotions, finding it difficult to discern whether joy or sorrow predominated. Her vague and uncertain suspicions about Mr. Darcy's involvement in helping to secure her sister's marriage—which she had feared to entertain as an act of kindness too immense to be likely, yet also dreaded might be true due to the burden of gratitude it would impose—were confirmed as far exceeding her initial thoughts! He had intentionally pursued them to London, taking on all the difficulty and embarrassment associated with such an investigation, which required him to plead with a woman he must have detested and scorned. He was forced to meet frequently with, reason with, persuade, and ultimately pay off the man he most wished to avoid, whose very name was a source of distress to him. He had undertaken all this for a young woman he neither liked nor respected. A thought fleetingly suggested he had done it for her. However, this hope was quickly overshadowed by other considerations. She soon realised that even her self-importance was insufficient to believe that his affection for her, especially after she had rejected him, could possibly outweigh a feeling as fundamental as his aversion to being connected by marriage to Wickham. The idea of Wickham as a brother-in-law! Such a link must offend every sense of dignity. He had, without doubt, done a great deal. She felt ashamed contemplating the extent of his actions. Yet, the reason he provided for his intervention—that he felt he had been wrong—was not difficult to accept. He possessed a generous nature and the financial means to act on it. While she couldn't claim to be the primary motive, she could perhaps believe that a lingering partiality for her might have supported his efforts in a matter so crucial to her own peace of mind. It was painful, deeply painful, to know they were indebted to someone who could never be repaid. They owed the recovery of Lydia, her reputation, everything, to him. Oh, how sincerely she regretted every harsh feeling she had harboured, every impertinent remark she had ever directed towards him! She felt humbled regarding her own conduct, but she was proud of him—proud that in a situation demanding compassion and honour, he had managed to overcome his own impulses. She reread her aunt’s praise of him multiple times. It felt almost inadequate, but it pleased her. She even felt a measure of satisfaction, though tinged with sadness, upon recalling how firmly both she and her uncle had been convinced of a mutual understanding and regard existing between Mr. Darcy and herself.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "The letter's contents left Elizabeth feeling a mix of emotions, torn between happiness and distress. All her vague doubts and suspicions about whether Mr. Darcy had tried to help her sister’s situation—suspicions she had been reluctant to indulge because it seemed too generous to be likely, and yet also dreaded might be true because she would owe him—were confirmed true, and even more than she had imagined! Mr. Darcy had deliberately followed them to London, taken on all the trouble, humiliation, and difficulty required for such an investigation; he had to plead with a woman he must dislike, and had to frequently encounter, reason with, persuade, and ultimately bribe the man he wished most to avoid, whose very name pained him. He had done all this for someone he didn’t even respect or like. Her heart suggested that he did it for her, but she quickly reminded herself that it was unlikely for him to act out of love for a woman who had already refused him, especially since any connection with Wickham would be deeply offensive to his pride. Becoming Wickham’s brother-in-law was no easy thing for him to accept. She realized Mr. Darcy had done a great deal—more than she liked to admit. Yet his stated reason for getting involved was plausible: he felt he had made a mistake, he was generous, and he had the means to help. Elizabeth couldn't convince herself that she was the primary reason for his actions, but she could believe that his lingering feelings for her might have motivated him, since her happiness was at stake. It pained her to realize her family was indebted to someone who would never be fully repaid. They owed Lydia’s return, her reputation—everything—to him. Elizabeth deeply regretted every negative feeling and impudent remark she had ever directed at Darcy. Personally, she felt humbled, but also proud of him—proud that he had risen above himself in an act of honour and kindness. She reread her aunt’s praise of Darcy multiple times. Though it didn’t seem enough, it pleased her. She even felt a bittersweet happiness realizing that her aunt and uncle were so convinced of the mutual affection and trust between herself and Mr. Darcy."

A most delightful place! Excellent parsonage-house! It would have suited me in every respect.”\n“How should you have liked making sermons?”\n“Exceedingly well. I should have considered it as part of my duty, and the exertion would soon have been nothing. One ought not to repine; but, to be sure, it would have been such a thing for me! The quiet, the retirement of such a life, would have answered all my ideas of happiness! But it was not to be.

I can’t imagine what he was doing there.”\n“Perhaps preparing for his wedding to Miss de Bourgh,” Elizabeth suggested. “It must be something significant to draw him there at this point in the year.”\n“Undoubtedly. Did your visit to Lambton include seeing him? I believe the Gardiners mentioned you had.”\n“Yes, we did; he introduced us to his sister.”\n“And how did you find her?”\n“Very pleasant.”\n“Indeed, I’ve heard she has improved remarkably over the past year or two. When I last saw her, she didn’t seem particularly promising. I’m truly glad you liked her. I hope she turns out well.”\n“I’m sure she will; she’s passed the most challenging phase of her youth.”\n“Did you happen to travel through the village of Kympton?”\n“I don’t recall that we did.”\n“I ask because that is the church position I should have inherited. Such a wonderful place! An excellent parsonage! It would have been ideal for me in every way.”\n“How would you have felt about writing sermons?”\n“Extremely well. I would have viewed it as a necessary part of my duty, and the effort would soon have become negligible. One shouldn’t dwell on misfortune, but honestly, it would have meant everything to me! The peace, the quiet isolation of that kind of life, would have fulfilled all my dreams of happiness! But it wasn’t meant to be. Did Darcy ever mention that situation when you were in Kent?”\n“I was informed by what I considered reliable sources that the position was only left to you provisionally and at the discretion of the current patron.”\n“You were! Yes, there was an element of that; I told you as much initially, if you recall.”\n“I also heard that there was a period when preaching was not as appealing to you as it now appears; that you actually stated you would never become a clergyman, and that the arrangement was made accordingly.”\n“You did! And that wasn’t entirely unfounded. You might remember what I told you about that point when we first discussed it.”\nThey were now almost at the house entrance, as she had hurried their walk to escape him; and wishing, for her sister’s sake, not to anger him, she simply replied with a friendly smile, “Come, Mr. Wickham, we are like family now, you know.

Elizabeth hoped that would be the end of it, but he soon added, \"I was surprised to run into Darcy in town last month. We saw each other several times. I’m curious what took him there.\" \n\"Maybe he’s preparing to marry Miss de Bourgh,\" Elizabeth replied. \"It must be something important for him to go there at this time of year.\"\n\"Undoubtedly. Did you see him during your stay at Lambton? I think the Gardiners mentioned you did.\"\n\"Yes; he introduced us to his sister.\"\n\"Do you like her?\"\n\"Very much.\"\n\"I’ve heard she’s greatly improved in the last year or two. She wasn’t very impressive when I saw her last. I’m glad you liked her. I hope all goes well for her.\"\n\"I think it will; she’s passed the most difficult age.\"\n\"Did you go through Kympton village?\"\n\"I don’t remember doing so.\"\n\"I only ask because that’s the parish I was supposed to have. A wonderful place! The parsonage house is beautiful—it would have suited me perfectly.\"\n\"Would you have liked writing sermons?\"\n\"Very much. I would have seen it as part of my duty, and the effort would quickly have become easy. One shouldn’t complain, but truly, it would have been ideal for me: the peace and quiet would have matched my idea of happiness. But it wasn’t meant to be. Did Darcy ever talk to you about it while you were in Kent?\"\n\"I heard from a reliable source that it was left to you only on certain conditions, at the discretion of the current patron.\"\n\"You did! Yes, that's true; I told you so before, if you recall.\"\n\"I also heard that you once weren’t so keen on being a clergyman, that you even said you’d never take holy orders, and the situation was settled accordingly.\"\n\"You heard that! And there's some truth to it. You may remember what I told you when we first talked about it.\"\nBy now, they were almost at the house, as Elizabeth had walked quickly to escape him. Not wanting to upset him—for her sister’s sake—she smiled kindly and said, \"Let’s not argue about the past, Mr. Wickham. We’re family now, after all. I hope we’ll always agree in the future.\"\nShe offered her hand, which he kissed with courteous affection, though he looked a little embarrassed, and they went into the house."

Lydia does not leave me because she is married; but only because her husband’s regiment happens to be so far off. If that had been nearer, she would not have gone so soon.”\nBut the spiritless condition which this event threw her into was shortly relieved, and her mind opened again to the agitation of hope, by an article of news which then began to be in circulation. The housekeeper at Netherfield had received orders to prepare for the arrival of her master, who was coming down in a day or two, to shoot there for several weeks. Mrs. Bennet was quite in the fidgets. She looked at Jane, and smiled, and shook her head, by turns.\n“Well, well, and so Mr. Bingley is coming down, sister,” (for Mrs. Philips first brought her the news). “Well, so much the better. Not that I care about it, though. He is nothing to us, you know, and I am sure I never want to see him again. But, however, he is very welcome to come to Netherfield, if he likes it. And who knows what may happen? But that is nothing to us. You know, sister, we agreed long ago never to mention a word about it.

He comes down on Thursday, at the latest, very likely on Wednesday.

This should make you feel better about your other four daughters remaining unmarried.\" \"That is not the case at all,\" Mrs. Bennet insisted. \"Lydia isn’t leaving because she got married; it’s just because her husband’s military unit is stationed so far away. If it were closer, she wouldn’t have left so soon.\" However, her low spirits, caused by this event, were soon lifted, and her mind became receptive once more to hopeful anticipation, due to a piece of news that began circulating. The housekeeper at Netherfield had received instructions to get ready for her employer’s arrival; he was expected to come down in a day or two to spend several weeks shooting there. Mrs. Bennet became very agitated. She alternately looked at Jane, smiled, and shook her head. \"Well now, isn't that something, Mr. Bingley is coming back, sister,\" (as it was Mrs. Philips who first informed her). \"Well, that's all for the better. Not that I care, mind you. He means nothing to us, as you know, and I’m certain I never want to see him again. But, regardless, he is quite welcome to come to Netherfield if he wishes. And who knows what might occur? But that doesn't concern us. You know, sister, we agreed ages ago never to discuss it. So, it's absolutely confirmed he's coming?\" \"You can certainly rely on it,\" her sister replied, \"because Mrs. Nichols was in Meryton last night; I saw her passing by, and I deliberately went outside to learn the truth, and she assured me it was definitely true.

Perhaps you'll appreciate that the other four aren't married yet.\" Mrs. Bennet disagreed, saying, \"That's not true. Lydia hasn't left because she's married, but because her husband's regiment is stationed far away. If they'd been closer, she wouldn't have gone so soon.\"\n\nHowever, her low spirits didn't last.

That's good, though I don't care much about it. He's nothing to us, and I certainly have no desire to see him. Still, he's welcome at Netherfield if he wants, and who knows what could happen? Not that it concerns us. Remember, we agreed never to mention it. So, are you certain he's coming?\" Mrs. Philips reassured her, explaining, \"You can be sure. Mrs. Nichols was in Meryton yesterday— I saw her and asked her directly. She confirmed it's true; Mr. Bingley is coming no later than Thursday, possibly Wednesday.

I was only confused for the moment, because I felt that I should be looked at. I do assure you that the news does not affect me either with pleasure or pain.

She was only pleased he was coming alone because it meant they would see less of him. She clarified she wasn't concerned about her own feelings but feared what other people might say. Elizabeth was puzzled by this. Had she not met him in Derbyshire, she might have thought he was just returning for a simple visit without other intentions. However, she still believed he had feelings for Jane and was unsure whether he had his friend's permission to come or if he was brave enough to return without it. Elizabeth sometimes thought it was unfair that this poor man couldn't come to a house he had legally rented without causing all this speculation. She decided to stop thinking about him.

To Jane, he could be only a man whose proposals she had refused, and whose merits she had undervalued; but to her own more extensive information, he was the person to whom the whole family were indebted for the first of benefits, and whom she regarded herself with an interest, if not quite so tender, at least as reasonable and just, as what Jane felt for Bingley.

She knew only a little about their encounter in Derbyshire and therefore sympathized with the awkwardness her sister must be feeling, seeing him almost for the first time since receiving his explanatory letter. Both sisters felt quite uneasy, each concerned for the other and naturally for themselves. Meanwhile, their mother continued talking about her dislike for Mr. Darcy and her decision to be polite to him only as Bingley's friend, her words unheard by either of them. However, Elizabeth had reasons for her discomfort that Jane could not yet guess, as she had not yet found the courage to show Jane Mrs. Gardiner's letter or discuss her own changed feelings towards him. To Jane, Darcy was simply a man whose proposal she had refused and whose merits she had undervalued. But with her broader understanding, Elizabeth knew him to be the person to whom the entire family owed a crucial favour and felt an interest in him herself that, if not precisely tender, was at least as sensible and justified as Jane's feelings for Bingley. Her astonishment at his arrival—at him coming to Netherfield, to Longbourn, and seemingly seeking her out again voluntarily—was nearly as great as her initial surprise upon witnessing his altered behaviour in Derbyshire. The colour that had left her face returned for a brief moment with an added blush, and a smile of delight brightened her eyes, as she thought for that short time that his affection and intentions must still be unchanged. But she would not feel secure. \"Let me first see how he acts,\" she decided; \"only then will it be soon enough to entertain hopes.\"",

She saw Mr. Darcy with Mr. Bingley and then returned to sit with Jane. Kitty exclaimed to their mother that there was a gentleman with Mr. Bingley and wondered who he might be. Mrs. Bennet replied that it must be some acquaintance, as she wasn’t sure. Kitty then guessed that the visitor looked just like the tall, proud man who had previously accompanied Mr. Bingley—Mr. Darcy. Mrs. Bennet was surprised but confirmed it did look like Mr. Darcy. She declared that any friend of Mr. Bingley was welcome in their home, but on her own, she admitted she disliked Mr. Darcy’s presence. Jane was surprised and anxious for Elizabeth, since she did not know the full account of Elizabeth’s previous meeting with Darcy in Derbyshire, and realized it must be awkward for her sister to see him after his explanatory letter. Both sisters were uncomfortable, each concerned about the other, and for themselves, as Mrs. Bennet kept expressing her dislike of Mr. Darcy and her intention to be polite to him only for Mr. Bingley’s sake—not that either daughter paid her much mind. Meanwhile, Elizabeth was troubled in ways Jane couldn’t suspect: she hadn’t yet had the courage to show Jane Mrs. Gardiner’s letter or to share how her feelings towards Mr. Darcy had changed. To Jane, Darcy was just a man whose proposal Elizabeth had rejected and whose qualities she had underestimated. But Elizabeth, aware of all he had done for their family, now felt for him a regard as rational and fair as Jane’s affection for Bingley, if not as tender. She was almost as amazed by his decision to come to Netherfield and Longbourn to seek her out again as she had been by his changed behavior in Derbyshire. For a brief moment, color returned to Elizabeth’s face and she smiled with joy, thinking that perhaps his feelings for her hadn’t changed, but she refused to let herself hope too soon. “Let me see how he acts first,” she said to herself, “then there will be time enough for expectations.”"

Jane looked a little paler than usual, but more sedate than Elizabeth had expected. On the gentlemen’s appearing, her colour increased; yet she received them with tolerable ease, and with a propriety of behaviour equally free from any symptom of resentment, or any unnecessary complaisance.\nElizabeth said as little to either as civility would allow, and sat down again to her work, with an eagerness which it did not often command. She had ventured only one glance at Darcy. He looked serious as usual; and, she thought, more as he had been used to look in Hertfordshire, than as she had seen him at Pemberley. But, perhaps, he could not in her mother’s presence be what he was before her uncle and aunt. It was a painful, but not an improbable, conjecture.\nBingley she had likewise seen for an instant, and in that short period saw him looking both pleased and embarrassed. He was received by Mrs. Bennet with a degree of civility which made her two daughters ashamed, especially when contrasted with the cold and ceremonious politeness of her courtesy and address of his friend.\nElizabeth particularly, who knew that her mother owed to the latter the preservation of her favourite daughter from irremediable infamy, was hurt and distressed to a most painful degree by a distinction so ill applied.\nDarcy, after inquiring of her how Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner did—a question which she could not answer without confusion—said scarcely anything. He was not seated by her: perhaps that was the reason of his silence; but it had not been so in Derbyshire. There he had talked to her friends when he could not to herself. But now several minutes elapsed, without bringing the sound of his voice; and when occasionally, unable to resist the impulse of curiosity, she raised her eyes to his face, she as often found him looking at Jane as at herself, and frequently on no object but the ground. More thoughtfulness and less anxiety to please, than when they last met, were plainly expressed. She was disappointed, and angry with herself for being so.\n“Could I expect it to be otherwise?” said she. “Yet why did he come?”\nShe was in no humour for conversation with anyone but himself; and to him she had hardly courage to speak.\nShe inquired after his sister, but could do no more.\n“It is a long time, Mr. Bingley, since you went away,” said Mrs. Bennet.\nHe readily agreed to it.\n“I began to be afraid you would never come back again. People did say, you meant to quit the place entirely at Michaelmas; but, however, I hope it is not true. A great many changes have happened in the neighbourhood since you went away. Miss Lucas is married and settled: and one of my own daughters. I suppose you have heard of it; indeed, you must have seen it in the papers. It was in the ‘Times’ and the ‘Courier,’ I know; though it was not put in as it ought to be. It was only said, ‘Lately, George Wickham, Esq., to Miss Lydia Bennet,’ without there being a syllable said of her father, or the place where she lived, or anything. It was my brother Gardiner’s drawing up, too, and I wonder how he came to make such an awkward business of it. Did you see it?”\nBingley replied that he did, and made his congratulations. Elizabeth dared not lift up her eyes. How Mr. Darcy looked, therefore, she could not tell.\n“It is a delightful thing, to be sure, to have a daughter well married,” continued her mother; “but at the same time, Mr. Bingley, it is very hard to have her taken away from me. They are gone down to Newcastle, a place quite northward it seems, and there they are to stay, I do not know how long. His regiment is there; for I suppose you have heard of his leaving the ——shire, and of his being gone into the Regulars. Thank heaven! he has some friends, though, perhaps, not so many as he deserves.”\nElizabeth, who knew this to be levelled at Mr. Darcy, was in such misery of shame that she could hardly keep her seat. It drew from her, however, the exertion of speaking, which nothing else had so effectually done before; and she asked Bingley whether he meant to make any stay in the country at present. A few weeks, he believed.\n“When you have killed all your own birds, Mr. Bingley,” said her mother, “I beg you will come here and shoot as many as you please on Mr. Bennet’s manor. I am sure he will be vastly happy to oblige you, and will save all the best of the coveys for you.”\nElizabeth’s misery increased at such unnecessary, such officious attention! Were the same fair prospect to arise at present, as had flattered them a year ago, everything, she was persuaded, would be hastening to the same vexatious conclusion. At that instant she felt, that years of happiness could not make Jane or herself amends for moments of such painful confusion.\n“The first wish of my heart,” said she to herself, “is never more to be in company with either of them.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "Elizabeth diligently focused on her work, trying to maintain her composure, and avoided looking up until her anxious curiosity made her glance at her sister's face as the servant announced the visitors. Jane appeared slightly less colourful than usual, but she seemed calmer than Elizabeth had anticipated. When the gentlemen entered, her complexion heightened; however, she greeted them with a reasonable degree of ease and appropriate behaviour, displaying neither any sign of lingering resentment nor any unnecessary eagerness to please. Elizabeth spoke only the minimum required by politeness to either man and promptly resumed her sewing with an intensity it did not often command. She had risked only one quick look at Darcy. He appeared as serious as usual; and, she thought, he looked more like the man she remembered from Hertfordshire than the one she had encountered at Pemberley. Perhaps, she considered, in her mother's presence, he couldn't be the same as he had been before her uncle and aunt. This was a difficult thought, but not an improbable one. She had also seen Bingley for just an instant, and during that brief period, she saw him looking both pleased and uncomfortable. Mrs. Bennet received him with an excessive warmth that embarrassed her two daughters, particularly when contrasted with the cool and formal politeness of her greeting to his friend. Elizabeth, who was well aware that her mother owed Darcy the preservation of her favorite daughter from complete disgrace, was deeply hurt and distressed by such an unfairly applied distinction. Darcy, after inquiring about the welfare of Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner—a question she answered with noticeable hesitation—said hardly anything else. He was not seated next to her: perhaps that explained his silence; but it had not been that way in Derbyshire, where he had spoken to her friends when he could not speak to her directly. However, now several minutes passed without the sound of his voice; and when, occasionally, unable to resist the urge of curiosity, she raised her eyes to his face, she as often found him looking at Jane or sometimes just at the ground, as frequently as at herself. A clear expression of deeper thought and less anxiety to please than when they last met was evident. She felt disappointed and annoyed with herself for feeling that way. \"Could I have expected anything different?\" she asked herself. \"Yet why did he come?\" She felt no inclination for conversation with anyone but him, but she barely had the courage to speak to him. She managed only to ask about his sister. \"It's been a very long time, Mr. Bingley, since you went away,\" said Mrs. Bennet. He readily agreed. \"I began to fear you would never return again. People did say you intended to leave the place entirely at Michaelmas; but, however, I hope that's not true. A great many changes have occurred in the neighborhood since you left. Miss Lucas is married and settled; and one of my own daughters as well. I suppose you have heard of it; indeed, you must have seen it in the newspapers. It was in the 'Times' and the 'Courier,' I know; though it was not published as it ought to have been. It only said, 'Recently, George Wickham, Esq., to Miss Lydia Bennet,' without a word mentioned of her father, or the place where she lived, or anything. It was my brother Gardiner's writing, too, and I wonder how he managed to make such a clumsy business of it. Did you see it?\" Bingley replied that he had seen it and offered his congratulations. Elizabeth dared not look up. Therefore, she could not tell how Mr. Darcy looked. \"It is a wonderful thing, to be sure, to have a daughter well married,\" her mother continued; \"but at the same time, Mr. Bingley, it is very difficult to have her taken away from me. They have gone north to Newcastle, a place apparently quite far away, and they are to stay there, I don't know how long. His regiment is there; for I suppose you have heard of his leaving the ---shire regiment and joining the Regulars. Thank heaven! he does have some friends, though perhaps not as many as he deserves.\" Elizabeth, who knew this remark was aimed at Mr. Darcy, felt such intense shame she could hardly remain in her seat. Nevertheless, it prompted her to speak, something nothing else had so effectively achieved before; and she asked Bingley if he intended to stay in the country for any period at present. He believed it would be for a few weeks. \"When you have killed all your own birds, Mr. Bingley,\" her mother said, \"I beg you will come here and shoot as many as you please on Mr. Bennet's estate. I am sure he will be extremely happy to assist you, and will save all the best groups of birds for you.\" Elizabeth's discomfort increased at such unnecessary, such pushy attention! She was convinced that if the same favorable opportunity were to arise now, as had flattered them a year ago, everything, she was certain, would hasten to the same frustrating conclusion. In that moment, she felt that years of happiness could not compensate Jane or herself for moments of such painful embarrassment. \"My greatest wish,\" she thought to herself, \"is never again to be in the company of either of them.\"",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "Elizabeth sat focused on her work, trying to remain calm and not daring to look up, until her curiosity finally made her glance at Jane when the servant entered. Jane appeared paler than normal, but calmer than Elizabeth anticipated. When the gentlemen entered, Jane blushed yet greeted them politely, without showing anger or excessive friendliness. Elizabeth spoke only as much as good manners required and returned to her work with more energy than usual. She risked one look at Darcy, who seemed as serious as ever, reminding her more of how he was in Hertfordshire than at Pemberley, though she reasoned he might not behave openly around her mother. She found this probable, if somewhat painful. She caught a brief glimpse of Bingley, who looked both happy and uneasy. Mrs. Bennet greeted him with forced civility, which embarrassed her daughters, and treated Darcy with cold, formal courtesy—much to Elizabeth’s distress, since she knew Darcy had saved Lydia from ruin. Darcy only asked her about the Gardiners, a question she stammered over, and said little else, perhaps because he wasn’t seated near her; but in Derbyshire, he had spoken to her friends regardless. Now, he hardly spoke, and when Elizabeth peeked at him, he was usually looking at Jane or the floor, seeming thoughtful but less eager to please than before—which disappointed her, though she was ashamed to admit it. She wondered, ‘Could I have expected anything else? Yet, why did he come?’ She wasn’t interested in anyone’s conversation but his, and barely had the courage to talk to him, only managing to ask after his sister. Mrs. Bennet remarked to Bingley that he had been away a long time, expressing hope it wasn’t true he’d left for good, and mentioning various social changes. She brought up Lydia’s marriage, annoyed it wasn’t more formally announced, and asked Bingley if he’d seen it in the newspaper. Bingley said he had and congratulated them, while Elizabeth avoided looking up, so couldn’t see Darcy’s reaction. Mrs. Bennet continued, lamenting Lydia’s absence and mentioning Wickham’s military posting, slyly hinting at Darcy; this shamed Elizabeth so much she could hardly sit still, but it spurred her to speak, asking Bingley about his plans to stay in the country—a few weeks, he replied. Mrs. Bennet then invited Bingley to hunt on Mr. Bennet’s land. Elizabeth’s embarrassment grew at her mother’s over-the-top hospitality, feeling sure that if similar hopes as last year returned, the outcome would be equally frustrating. In that moment, she felt that even years of happiness couldn’t atone for the distress she and Jane currently felt, and she wished never to be in the same company as either man again."

When first he came in, he had spoken to her but little, but every five minutes seemed to be giving her more of his attention. He found her as handsome as she had been last year; as good-natured, and as unaffected, though not quite so chatty.

I have not forgot, you see; and I assure you I was very much disappointed that you did not come back and keep your engagement.”\nBingley looked a little silly at this reflection, and said something of his concern at having been prevented by business. They then went away.\nMrs. Bennet had been strongly inclined to ask them to stay and dine there that day; but, though she always kept a very good table, she did not think anything less than two courses could be good enough for a man on whom she had such anxious designs, or satisfy the appetite and pride of one who had ten thousand a year.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "Their presence and conversation offer no pleasure that could possibly make up for such profound discomfort! I hope I am never obliged to encounter either of them again!” Nevertheless, the severe unhappiness, which years of future joy could seemingly not alleviate, soon found some immediate relief upon noticing how strongly her sister's beauty was reigniting the admiration of her previous suitor. When he first arrived, he had barely spoken to her, but every few minutes, he seemed to give her more of his attention. He saw her as being just as attractive as she had been the year before; equally kind-hearted and genuine, though perhaps not quite as conversational. Jane was keen for no alteration to be noticed in her whatsoever and truly believed she was speaking as much as usual; however, her thoughts were so consumed that she often didn't realize when she was quiet. As the gentlemen prepared to leave, Mrs. Bennet recalled her planned courtesy, and they were invited and committed to dining at Longbourn in a few days' time. “You still owe me a visit, Mr. Bingley,” she added; “for when you travelled to town last winter, you gave your word that you would join us for a family dinner as soon as you returned. As you can see, I haven't forgotten; and I must tell you, I was quite disappointed that you did not come back and keep your promise.” Bingley appeared slightly awkward at this observation and offered an explanation about being unable to do so due to business matters. They then departed. Mrs. Bennet had been strongly inclined to ask them to remain and dine there that very day; but, although she always provided a very good meal, she felt that nothing less than two full courses would be adequate for a man on whom she had such significant designs, or suffice for the appetite and standing of someone with an income of ten thousand pounds annually.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "Their company provided no enjoyment that could make up for such unhappiness. She wished to never see either of them again. However, her sorrow, which she believed could not be eased even by years of happiness, was lifted when she noticed how her sister’s beauty reignited her former lover’s interest. At first, he barely spoke to her, but gradually he paid more and more attention, clearly still admiring her as much as before; she was as attractive, kind, and genuine as ever, though a bit less talkative. Jane was determined that no one should notice any change in her, and she truly thought she talked just as much as usual, but she was so preoccupied that she sometimes didn’t realize when she fell silent. When the gentlemen stood to leave, Mrs. Bennet remembered her duties as hostess, and invited them to dinner at Longbourn in a few days. 'You certainly owe us a visit, Mr. Bingley,' she said, 'since you promised last winter to dine with us after your return from town. I haven’t forgotten, and I was quite disappointed you didn’t keep your promise.' Bingley looked somewhat embarrassed and mumbled something about business having kept him away. With that, the gentlemen departed. Although Mrs. Bennet had been tempted to invite them to stay for dinner right then, she decided against it; even though she prided herself on her hospitality, she felt that anything less than a lavish two-course meal would not be good enough for a man she considered so important, or satisfy someone with such wealth and status."

Mr. Darcy’s behaviour astonished and vexed her.\n“Why, if he came only to be silent, grave, and indifferent,” said she, “did he come at all?”\nShe could settle it in no way that gave her pleasure.\n“He could be still amiable, still pleasing to my uncle and aunt, when he was in town; and why not to me? If he fears me, why come hither? If he no longer cares for me, why silent? Teasing, teasing man! I will think no more about him.”\nHer resolution was for a short time involuntarily kept by the approach of her sister, who joined her with a cheerful look which showed her better satisfied with their visitors than Elizabeth.\n“Now,” said she, “that this first meeting is over, I feel perfectly easy. I know my own strength, and I shall never be embarrassed again by his coming. I am glad he dines here on Tuesday. It will then be publicly seen, that on both sides we meet only as common and indifferent acquaintance.”\n“Yes, very indifferent, indeed,” said Elizabeth, laughingly. “Oh, Jane! take care.”\n“My dear Lizzy, you cannot think me so weak as to be in danger now.”\n“I think you are in very great danger of making him as much in love with you as ever.”",

Mr. Darcy's conduct utterly surprised and annoyed her. She wondered aloud, \"If his only intention in coming was to be quiet, serious, and detached, what was the point of him showing up at all?\" She couldn't find any explanation that she found satisfactory. She pondered, \"He managed to be agreeable and pleasant to my uncle and aunt when he was in London, so why couldn't he be that way with me? If I intimidate him, why did he come here? If he no longer cares for me, why the silence? What an aggravating, bothersome man! I refuse to think about him anymore.\" Her decision was momentarily upheld, not by choice, but by the arrival of her sister, who approached with a cheerful expression suggesting she was more pleased with their recent guests than Elizabeth was. Jane commented, \"Now that this initial encounter is over, I feel completely at ease. I am confident in myself and won't feel awkward again when he visits. I'm glad he's having dinner here on Tuesday. It will become clear to everyone that we are interacting purely as ordinary, unconcerned acquaintances.\" Elizabeth responded with a laugh, \"Yes, truly unconcerned,\" adding, \"Oh, Jane, be careful!\" Jane replied, \"My dear Lizzy, surely you don't believe I'm so fragile as to be at risk now.\" Elizabeth countered, \"I think you are very much at risk of causing him to fall just as deeply in love with you as he ever was.\"",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "Once the guests had left, Elizabeth went outside for a walk, hoping to lift her mood—or rather, to dwell privately on the very thoughts that troubled her. She was both surprised and annoyed by Mr. Darcy's conduct.\n\n“If he only intended to be so quiet, serious, and distant,” she wondered, “why did he come at all?”\n\nNo explanation she could come up with made her feel any better.\n\n“He was friendly and agreeable to my uncle and aunt when we were in town; so why not to me? If he's afraid of me, why visit? If he doesn't care about me anymore, why keep silent? What a bothersome man! I won’t think about him anymore.”\n\nBut this resolve lasted only as long as it took for her sister to come over with a cheerful expression, clearly more pleased with their guests than Elizabeth had been.\n\n\"Now that the first meeting is over,\" her sister said, \"I feel completely comfortable. I know I can handle myself, and Mr. Darcy’s visits will never make me uneasy again. I’m glad he is coming to dinner on Tuesday. That way, everyone can see that we meet only as casual acquaintances—nothing more.\"\n\n“Yes, very casual, indeed,” replied Elizabeth with a laugh. “Oh, Jane! Be careful.”\n\n“My dear Lizzy, surely you don’t think I’m so foolish as to be at risk now.”\n\n“I think there’s a real risk of making him fall for you all over again.”"

When they repaired to the dining-room, Elizabeth eagerly watched to see whether Bingley would take the place which, in all their former parties, had belonged to him, by her sister. Her prudent mother, occupied by the same ideas, forbore to invite him to sit by herself. On entering the room, he seemed to hesitate; but Jane happened to look round, and happened to smile: it was decided. He placed himself by her.\nElizabeth, with a triumphant sensation, looked towards his friend. He bore it with noble indifference; and she would have imagined that Bingley had received his sanction to be happy, had she not seen his eyes likewise turned towards Mr. Darcy, with an expression of half-laughing alarm.\nHis behaviour to her sister was such during dinnertime as showed an admiration of her, which, though more guarded than formerly, persuaded Elizabeth, that, if left wholly to himself, Jane’s happiness, and his own, would be speedily secured. Though she dared not depend upon the consequence, she yet received pleasure from observing his behaviour. It gave her all the animation that her spirits could boast; for she was in no cheerful humour. Mr. Darcy was almost as far from her as the table could divide them. He was on one side of her mother. She knew how little such a situation would give pleasure to either, or make either appear to advantage. She was not near enough to hear any of their discourse; but she could see how seldom they spoke to each other, and how formal and cold was their manner whenever they did. Her mother’s ungraciousness made the sense of what they owed him more painful to Elizabeth’s mind; and she would, at times, have given anything to be privileged to tell him, that his kindness was neither unknown nor unfelt by the whole of the family.",

Throughout this interval, Mrs. Bennet allowed herself to fully embrace the joyful expectations that Bingley's amiable manner and basic courtesy, shown during his half-hour call, had revitalized. On Tuesday, a large gathering took place at Longbourn, and the two individuals who were most anxiously awaited, true to their reputation for punctuality as sportsmen, arrived well on time. When they moved to the dining area, Elizabeth keenly observed to see if Bingley would occupy the seat next to her sister, a spot he had always claimed at all their previous parties. Her sensible mother, sharing the same hope, deliberately did not suggest he sit beside her. As he entered the room, he seemed momentarily uncertain, but Jane happened to look around and smile, which settled the matter. He chose the seat next to her. Elizabeth, feeling a sense of triumph, glanced towards his friend. Darcy maintained an air of noble indifference. She would have thought Bingley had received Darcy's permission to be content, had she not also seen Bingley's eyes turn towards Mr. Darcy with an expression mixing amusement and apprehension. His conduct towards her sister during the dinner service indicated an admiration for her that, although more subdued than previously, convinced Elizabeth that, if left completely to his own judgment, Jane's and his own happiness would be swiftly secured. Even though she couldn't rely on this outcome, she still found satisfaction in watching his behaviour. It provided her with all the cheerfulness her spirits could muster, as she was not in a good mood herself. Mr. Darcy was seated almost as far from her as the table permitted, on one side of her mother. She understood how little enjoyment such an arrangement would bring to either of them, or help either make a favorable impression. She was not close enough to hear any of their conversation, but she could see how infrequently they spoke to each other, and how reserved and cold their interactions were whenever they did. Her mother's lack of politeness made the feeling of obligation they owed him more distressing for Elizabeth, and at times, she would have sacrificed anything for the opportunity to tell him that his past kindness had been both recognised and deeply felt by the entire family.",

Mrs. Bennet, sharing Elizabeth's hope, deliberately refrained from inviting him to sit with her. As the company entered, Bingley seemed uncertain about where to sit, but when Jane looked back and smiled at him, he made his decision and sat by her. Elizabeth felt a sense of victory and glanced at Bingley's friend. He appeared unaffected, but she also noticed Bingley glancing at Mr. Darcy with a half-amused, slightly worried look, as if seeking his approval. During dinner, Bingley’s conduct towards Jane showed clear admiration, though he was more reserved than he used to be, which made Elizabeth confident that, if left to his own devices, both his and Jane's happiness would soon be secured. Although she hesitated to count on this outcome, it cheered her to watch them together. This was the brightest her spirits had been, for she was otherwise not in a cheerful mood. Mr. Darcy was seated as far from her as possible at the table, next to Mrs. Bennet, and Elizabeth knew this made for an unpleasant situation and did not show either of them in the best light. She was too far away to hear their conversation, but could see they spoke infrequently and always in a stiff, cold manner. Her mother's rudeness made Elizabeth feel more strongly how much the family owed Mr. Darcy, and she sometimes longed to be able to tell him that the family's gratitude for his kindness was known and deeply felt."

The dinner was as well dressed as any I ever saw. The venison was roasted to a turn—and everybody said, they never saw so fat a haunch. The soup was fifty times better than what we had at the Lucases’ last week; and even Mr. Darcy acknowledged that the partridges were remarkably well done; and I suppose he has two or three French cooks at least. And, my dear Jane, I never saw you look in greater beauty. Mrs. Long said so too, for I asked her whether you did not. And what do you think she said besides? ‘Ah! Mrs. Bennet, we shall have her at Netherfield at last!’ She did, indeed. I do think Mrs. Long is as good a creature as ever lived—and her nieces are very pretty behaved girls, and not at all handsome: I like them prodigiously.”\nMrs. Bennet, in short, was in very great spirits: she had seen enough of Bingley’s behaviour to Jane to be convinced that she would get him at last; and her expectations of advantage to her family, when in a happy humour, were so far beyond reason, that she was quite disappointed at not seeing him there again the next day, to make his proposals.\n“It has been a very agreeable day,” said Miss Bennet to Elizabeth. “The party seemed so well selected, so suitable one with the other. I hope we may often meet again.”\nElizabeth smiled.\n“Lizzy, you must not do so. You must not suspect me. It mortifies me. I assure you that I have now learnt to enjoy his conversation as an agreeable and sensible young man without having a wish beyond it. I am perfectly satisfied, from what his manners now are, that he never had any design of engaging my affection. It is only that he is blessed with greater sweetness of address, and a stronger desire of generally pleasing, than any other man.”\n“You are very cruel,” said her sister, “you will not let me smile, and are provoking me to it every moment.”\n“How hard it is in some cases to be believed! And how impossible in others! But why should you wish to persuade me that I feel more than I acknowledge?”\n“That is a question which I hardly know how to answer. We all love to instruct, though we can teach only what is not worth knowing. Forgive me; and if you persist in indifference, do not make me your confidante.”",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "“Alright, girls,” she began once they were alone, “what did you think of the day? I must say, I believe everything went exceptionally well. The dinner was presented as beautifully as any I’ve ever seen. The venison was roasted just right—and everyone commented on how unusually plump the haunch was. The soup was fifty times better than the one we had at the Lucases' last week; and even Mr. Darcy admitted that the partridges were cooked exceptionally well; and I imagine he has at least two or three French chefs. And, my dear Jane, I have never seen you look more lovely. Mrs. Long agreed, because I specifically asked her if she didn’t. And guess what else she said? ‘Ah! Mrs. Bennet, we will finally have her at Netherfield!’ She really did. I honestly think Mrs. Long is one of the best people alive—and her nieces are very well-mannered girls, though not attractive at all: I like them immensely.”\n\nIn short, Mrs. Bennet was in extremely high spirits: she had seen enough of Bingley’s behaviour towards Jane to be convinced that a marriage was inevitable; and her hopes for her family’s future, especially when she was cheerful, were so wildly optimistic that she was quite upset not to see him there again the next day, ready to propose.\n\n“It was a very pleasant day,” said Miss Bennet to Elizabeth. “The guests seemed so well-matched, so compatible with one another. I hope we will have occasion to meet often again.”\n\nElizabeth smiled.\n\n“Lizzy, you mustn’t do that. You mustn’t suspect me. It hurts me. I assure you that I have now learned to enjoy his conversation as a pleasant and sensible young man without wishing for anything more. I am perfectly satisfied, based on his current behaviour, that he never intended to win my affection. It is simply that he is blessed with a naturally sweeter way of speaking, and a stronger desire to please everyone in general, than any other man.”\n\n“You are being very unkind,” said her sister, “you won’t let me smile, and you are provoking me to do so every moment.”\n\n“How difficult it is to be believed in some instances! And how impossible in others! But why do you want to convince me that I feel more than I acknowledge?”\n\n“That is a question I scarcely know how to answer. We all love to give advice, even though we can only teach what isn’t truly valuable. Forgive me; and if you continue in this detached manner, don’t expect me to be your confidante.”",

The soup was far better than what we had at the Lucases' last week, and even Mr. Darcy admitted that the partridges were cooked very well—which is impressive, given that I assume he has several French chefs. And my dear Jane, you looked more beautiful than ever. Mrs. Long agreed with me, for I asked her about it. And do you know what else she said? She commented, 'Ah! Mrs. Bennet, we shall have her living at Netherfield at last!' I really think Mrs. Long is one of the kindest people, and her nieces are well-behaved, if not truly attractive—I like them very much.\" In short, Mrs. Bennet was in excellent spirits: based on Bingley's treatment of Jane, she was sure he would eventually propose; and her hopes for her family's future were so vivid that she was almost disappointed he did not return the next day to declare himself. \n\nMiss Bennet said to Elizabeth, \"It was a very pleasant day. The guests were well matched and seemed comfortable together. I hope we can gather like this again.\" Elizabeth smiled. Jane continued, \"Lizzy, don't smile at me; please don't doubt my feelings. It embarrasses me. I promise you I've grown to enjoy his company as that of an agreeable and sensible young man, and nothing more. I'm perfectly convinced—from how he behaves—that he never intended to win my affections. He is simply more charming and eager to please than other men.\" Her sister responded, \"You're being mean, not letting me smile, but tempting me to do it anyway.\" Jane said, \"It's so hard to be believed in some matters, and impossible in others. But why do you want to make me admit to feelings I don't have?\" Elizabeth replied, \"I can hardly answer that. Everyone likes to give advice, though it's often useless. Forgive me; and if you really don't care about him, please don't make me your confidante.\""

He is, indeed. Make haste, make haste. Here, Sarah, come to Miss Bennet this moment, and help her on with her gown. Never mind Miss Lizzy’s hair.”\n“We will be down as soon as we can,” said Jane; “but I dare say Kitty is forwarder than either of us, for she went upstairs half an hour ago.”\n“Oh! hang Kitty! what has she to do with it? Come, be quick, be quick! where is your sash, my dear?”\nBut when her mother was gone, Jane would not be prevailed on to go down without one of her sisters.\nThe same anxiety to get them by themselves was visible again in the evening. After tea, Mr. Bennet retired to the library, as was his custom, and Mary went upstairs to her instrument. Two obstacles of the five being thus removed, Mrs. Bennet sat looking and winking at Elizabeth and Catherine for a considerable time, without making any impression on them. Elizabeth would not observe her; and when at last Kitty did, she very innocently said, “What is the matter, mamma? What do you keep winking at me for? What am I to do?”\n“Nothing, child, nothing. I did not wink at you.” She then sat still five minutes longer; but unable to waste such a precious occasion, she suddenly got up, and saying to Kitty,—\n“Come here, my love, I want to speak to you,” took her out of the room. Jane instantly gave a look at Elizabeth which spoke her distress at such premeditation, and her entreaty that she would not give in to it. In a few minutes, Mrs. Bennet half opened the door and called out,—\n“Lizzy, my dear, I want to speak with you.”\nElizabeth was forced to go.\n“We may as well leave them by themselves, you know,” said her mother as soon as she was in the hall. “Kitty and I are going upstairs to sit in my dressing-room.”\nElizabeth made no attempt to reason with her mother, but remained quietly in the hall till she and Kitty were out of sight, then returned into the drawing-room.\nMrs. Bennet’s schemes for this day were ineffectual. Bingley was everything that was charming, except the professed lover of her daughter. His ease and cheerfulness rendered him a most agreeable addition to their evening party; and he bore with the ill-judged officiousness of the mother, and heard all her silly remarks with a forbearance and command of countenance particularly grateful to the daughter.\nHe scarcely needed an invitation to stay supper; and before he went away an engagement was formed, chiefly through his own and Mrs. Bennet’s means, for his coming next morning to shoot with her husband.\nAfter this day, Jane said no more of her indifference. Not a word passed between the sisters concerning Bingley; but Elizabeth went to bed in the happy belief that all must speedily be concluded, unless Mr. Darcy returned within the stated time. Seriously, however, she felt tolerably persuaded that all this must have taken place with that gentleman’s concurrence.",

Mrs. Bennet rushed into her daughters' room in her robe, with her hair half styled, exclaiming, \"My dear Jane, hurry, hurry down! He's arrived—Mr. Bingley is here! He really is! Make haste, make haste! Sarah, come assist Miss Bennet immediately with her gown. Don't worry about Miss Lizzy's hair yet.\" Jane replied, \"We will be down as soon as we can, but I think Kitty might be ready sooner than either of us, as she went upstairs a half-hour ago.\" \"Oh, bother Kitty! What does she have to do with it? Come, be quick, be quick! Where is your sash, my love?\" However, after her mother left, Jane refused to go downstairs without one of her sisters. The same eagerness to leave them alone was evident again in the evening. After tea, Mr. Bennet retreated to his library as he usually did, and Mary went upstairs to practice her instrument. With two of the five family members removed, Mrs. Bennet sat watching and winking at Elizabeth and Catherine for a considerable time, without any success. Elizabeth ignored her, and when Kitty finally noticed, she asked innocently, \"What's wrong, Mamma? Why are you winking at me? What am I supposed to do?\" \"Nothing, child, nothing. I wasn't winking at you.\" She remained still for five more minutes, but unable to let such a valuable opportunity pass, she suddenly stood up and, saying to Kitty, \"Come here, my dear, I need to talk to you,\" led her out of the room. Jane immediately looked at Elizabeth, a look that showed her distress at such obvious plotting and begged her not to comply. In a few minutes, Mrs. Bennet slightly opened the door and called out, \"Lizzy, darling, I need a word with you.\" Elizabeth was compelled to go. \"We may as well leave them alone, you know,\" her mother said as soon as Elizabeth was in the hall. \"Kitty and I are going upstairs to sit in my dressing-room.\" Elizabeth did not attempt to argue with her mother but remained quietly in the hall until she and Kitty were out of sight, then returned to the drawing-room. Mrs. Bennet's strategies for the day were unsuccessful. Bingley was utterly charming in every way, except for being the declared suitor of her daughter. His easy and cheerful manner made him a very pleasant addition to their evening; and he tolerated the mother's poorly judged interference and listened to all her silly comments with a patience and self-control that the daughter found particularly admirable. He almost didn't need an invitation to stay for supper; and before he left, an arrangement was made, largely due to his and Mrs. Bennet's efforts, for him to visit the next morning to shoot with her husband. After this day, Jane no longer spoke of her indifference. Not a word was exchanged between the sisters about Bingley; but Elizabeth went to bed confident that everything would quickly be settled, unless Mr. Darcy returned within the specified time frame. However, she felt quite convinced that all of this must have occurred with that gentleman's approval.",

Mrs. Bennet, still in her dressing gown with her hair half done, rushed into her daughters’ room exclaiming that Bingley had arrived and telling Jane to hurry downstairs. She called for Sarah to help Jane with her dress and told everyone not to bother with Elizabeth's hair. Jane replied that they would come down soon, but noted that Kitty had gone upstairs earlier and was likely more ready. Mrs. Bennet dismissed Kitty’s readiness as unimportant and hurried her daughters along, asking Jane about her sash. As soon as Mrs. Bennet left the room, Jane refused to go downstairs without one of her sisters accompanying her.\n\nLater that evening, after tea, Mr. Bennet left for the library and Mary went upstairs to play music, leaving Mrs. Bennet with Elizabeth and Catherine. Mrs. Bennet stared and winked at them for a long time, trying to signal them, but Elizabeth ignored her and Kitty didn’t understand what was happening. When Kitty finally asked, Mrs. Bennet denied signaling and sat quietly, but after a few minutes, took Kitty out of the room under the pretense of wanting to talk to her. Jane looked at Elizabeth, distressed by their mother’s plotting, silently pleading with Elizabeth not to give in. Shortly after, Mrs. Bennet returned and called Elizabeth out, who was forced to comply. In the hall, Mrs. Bennet said she and Kitty would go upstairs, hinting that Elizabeth should leave Jane and Bingley alone. Elizabeth did not argue, but waited until her mother and Kitty were gone before returning to the parlor. \n\nMrs. Bennet’s attempts at matchmaking that day were unsuccessful. Bingley was a delightful guest, charming everyone but not explicitly courting Jane. He was gracious about Mrs. Bennet’s meddling and tolerated her conversation with patience, which Mrs. Bennet’s daughters appreciated. Bingley readily agreed to stay for supper and, before leaving, plans were made—with encouragement from him and Mrs. Bennet—for him to return the next morning to go shooting with Mr. Bennet. After that day, Jane stopped pretending to be indifferent about Bingley, though she and Elizabeth did not discuss him. Elizabeth went to bed happily believing that Jane and Bingley’s relationship would soon be settled, unless Mr. Darcy returned unexpectedly. Still, she was fairly confident that Bingley was acting with Darcy’s approval."

As she opened the door, she saw her sister and Bingley standing together near the hearth, seemingly absorbed in serious conversation; and even if this sight hadn't aroused suspicion, their faces, as they quickly turned and moved away from each other, would have revealed everything. Their situation was quite awkward; but Elizabeth felt her own position was even worse.

When she returned to the drawing-room after finishing her letter, she was astonished to realize that her mother’s scheme might have succeeded too well. Upon entering, she saw her sister and Bingley standing close by the fireplace in deep conversation. Even if Elizabeth had doubted their intimacy, their embarrassed faces and quick movements apart when she entered gave everything away. The situation was already uncomfortable, but Elizabeth felt her own awkwardness was even greater. No one spoke a word; about to leave, Elizabeth was then surprised when Bingley—who had just sat down with the others—suddenly stood up, whispered something to her sister, and hurried out of the room."

In the absence of Jane, he always attached himself to Elizabeth for the pleasure of talking of her; and when Bingley was gone, Jane constantly sought the same means of relief.\n“He has made me so happy,” said she, one evening, “by telling me that he was totally ignorant of my being in town last spring! I had not believed it possible.”\n“I suspected as much,” replied Elizabeth. “But how did he account for it?”\n“It must have been his sisters’ doing. They were certainly no friends to his acquaintance with me, which I cannot wonder at, since he might have chosen so much more advantageously in many respects. But when they see, as I trust they will, that their brother is happy with me, they will learn to be contented, and we shall be on good terms again: though we can never be what we once were to each other.”\n“That is the most unforgiving speech,” said Elizabeth, “that I ever heard you utter. Good girl! It would vex me, indeed, to see you again the dupe of Miss Bingley’s pretended regard.”\n“Would you believe it, Lizzy, that when he went to town last November he really loved me, and nothing but a persuasion of my being indifferent would have prevented his coming down again?”\n“He made a little mistake, to be sure; but it is to the credit of his modesty.”\nThis naturally introduced a panegyric from Jane on his diffidence, and the little value he put on his own good qualities.\nElizabeth was pleased to find that he had not betrayed the interference of his friend; for, though Jane had the most generous and forgiving heart in the world, she knew it was a circumstance which must prejudice her against him.\n“I am certainly the most fortunate creature that ever existed!” cried Jane. “Oh, Lizzy, why am I thus singled from my family, and blessed above them all? If I could but see you as happy! If there were but such another man for you!”\n“If you were to give me forty such men I never could be so happy as you. Till I have your disposition, your goodness, I never can have your happiness. No, no, let me shift for myself; and, perhaps, if I have very good luck, I may meet with another Mr. Collins in time.”",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "After this, Bingley naturally began visiting Longbourn every day. He often arrived before breakfast and stayed until after supper, unless he felt compelled to accept a dinner invitation from some unpleasant neighbor he disliked. Consequently, Elizabeth had little opportunity for private conversation with her sister, as Jane gave all her attention to Bingley when he was present. However, Elizabeth found she could be quite helpful to both of them during the times they were apart. When Jane wasn't there, Bingley would invariably engage Elizabeth in conversation, mainly to talk about Jane. And when Bingley had left, Jane would seek out Elizabeth to talk about him. One evening, Jane confided, beaming, that Bingley had made her incredibly happy by telling her he had been completely unaware she was in London the previous spring, something she hadn't thought possible. Elizabeth replied that she had suspected as much and asked how he explained his ignorance. Jane believed it must have been his sisters' doing, admitting she wasn't surprised they weren't supportive of his acquaintance with her, as he could have made a far more advantageous choice in many ways. But she expressed hope that his sisters would see his happiness with her and eventually accept the situation, allowing them to be on good terms again, though never as close as they once were. Elizabeth called this the most unforgiving remark she had ever heard Jane make, adding warmly that it would truly upset her to see Jane deceived again by Miss Bingley's insincere affection. Jane then asked Elizabeth if she could believe that Bingley had genuinely loved her when he went to town last November and that only his conviction of her indifference had prevented him from returning sooner. Elizabeth commented that he had certainly made a mistake, but it reflected well on his modesty. This naturally led Jane to praise Bingley's humility and how little value he placed on his own good qualities. Elizabeth was pleased to learn that Bingley had not revealed his friend's interference, knowing that even with Jane's exceptionally kind and forgiving nature, this particular circumstance would undoubtedly prejudice her against Darcy. Jane then exclaimed that she felt like the luckiest person alive, asking Elizabeth why she, of all her family, was so specially blessed. She added how much she wished Elizabeth could be just as happy and find a man like Bingley for herself. Elizabeth responded that even if given forty such men, she could never achieve Jane's level of happiness. She stated that until she possessed Jane's temperament and kindness, she could never experience her happiness. She playfully concluded by saying she would manage on her own and perhaps, with great luck, she might eventually meet another Mr. Collins.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "From this point onwards, Bingley became a daily guest at Longbourn, often arriving before breakfast and staying until after supper—except when he was obliged to accept dinner invitations from less-than-welcome neighbors. Because of Bingley’s frequent presence, Elizabeth rarely had time to converse privately with Jane; Jane’s attention was entirely focused on Bingley while he was present. However, during the intervals when the couple was apart, Elizabeth found herself helping both of them: Bingley would talk to her about Jane, and Jane would later seek Elizabeth to talk about Bingley. One evening, Jane excitedly shared that Bingley had told her he hadn’t known she was in town the previous spring, something Jane had doubted possible. Elizabeth said she'd suspected as much, and asked how Bingley explained it. Jane believed it was his sisters’ doing, as they weren’t keen on his attachment to her—understandable, since he could have made a more advantageous match in their eyes. Still, Jane hoped that when they saw their brother’s happiness, they’d accept her and get along better, though they could never be as close as before. Elizabeth remarked, with admiration, that it was the most unforgiving thing Jane had ever said, expressing relief Jane wouldn't be fooled by Miss Bingley anymore. Jane then confided that Bingley had loved her last November, and only his belief that she was indifferent had kept him away. Elizabeth replied it was a minor error on his part, but showed his modesty. Jane then praised Bingley for undervaluing his own merits. Elizabeth was glad Bingley hadn’t revealed Darcy’s involvement, as she knew Jane’s generous nature, but feared such knowledge would bias her against him. Jane then exclaimed she was the luckiest person alive and wished Elizabeth could be as happy, hoping that there was someone just as wonderful for her. Elizabeth insisted that even with forty such men, she could never be as happy as Jane, lacking her sister’s good nature, and joked that with luck she might meet another Mr. Collins someday."

Though I know it must be a scandalous falsehood, though I would not injure him so much as to suppose the truth of it possible, I instantly resolved on setting off for this place, that I might make my sentiments known to you.”\n“If you believed it impossible to be true,” said Elizabeth, colouring with astonishment and disdain, “I wonder you took the trouble of coming so far. What could your Ladyship propose by it?”\n“At once to insist upon having such a report universally contradicted.”\n“Your coming to Longbourn, to see me and my family,” said Elizabeth coolly, “will be rather a confirmation of it—if, indeed, such a report is in existence.”\n“If! do you then pretend to be ignorant of it? Has it not been industriously circulated by yourselves? Do you not know that such a report is spread abroad?”\n“I never heard that it was.”\n“And can you likewise declare, that there is no foundation for it?”\n“I do not pretend to possess equal frankness with your Ladyship. You may ask questions which I shall not choose to answer.”\n",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "As soon as they entered the wooded area, Lady Catherine immediately started speaking, saying, \"Miss Bennet, you surely know exactly why I have travelled here. Your own feelings and conscience must reveal my purpose in coming.\" Elizabeth looked genuinely surprised, replying, \"Indeed, madam, you are mistaken; I honestly couldn't guess why you've honoured me with a visit.\" Lady Catherine responded sharply, her tone angry, \"Miss Bennet, you should understand that I am not someone to be treated lightly. However dishonest you choose to be, you will find no such insincerity in me. I am well-known for being direct and open, and I will certainly maintain this trait in a matter as crucial as this. A deeply disturbing rumour reached me two days ago. I was informed that your sister was not only about to make an excellent marriage but also that you—yes, Miss Elizabeth Bennet—would very likely soon marry my nephew, my own nephew, Mr. Darcy. Although I am certain it is a scandalous lie, and I refuse to think so poorly of him as to consider it true, I decided instantly to come here to make my feelings clear to you.\" Elizabeth, blushing from both surprise and disdain, said, \"If you believed it impossible, I'm surprised you went to the trouble of coming all this way. What did Your Ladyship hope to achieve?\" \"My intention is to insist immediately that this report is denied by everyone.\" \"Your visit to Longbourn, specifically to see me and my family,\" Elizabeth commented calmly, \"might actually lend credence to the rumour—that is, if such a rumour even exists.\" \"If! Are you pretending you don't know about it? Haven't you yourselves been actively spreading it? Are you unaware that this rumour is circulating widely?\" \"I've never heard that it was.\" \"And can you also state that there is absolutely no truth behind it?\" \"I don't claim to be as open as Your Ladyship. You may ask questions that I may choose not to answer.\"",

Your heart and conscience must reveal my purpose here.\" Elizabeth gazed at her with honest surprise. \"Really, madam, you are mistaken; I have no idea what brings me the honour of your visit.\" Lady Catherine, her tone irate, continued, \"Miss Bennet, you should realize that I am not someone to be fooled. Regardless of how insincere you choose to be, you will not find me acting the same. My reputation has always been built on honesty and openness, and in this matter of great importance, I shall not abandon those qualities. Two days ago, I received a most alarming report. I was told not only that your sister was about to have a highly favourable marriage, but also that you—Miss Elizabeth Bennet—would very likely soon after be married to my nephew, Mr. Darcy. Although I know this must be a malicious lie, and would not so insult him by believing it, I immediately decided to come here and make my feelings known to you.\" Elizabeth, flushed with shock and contempt, replied, \"If you truly believed it to be impossible, I am surprised you made the long journey. What is it you hope to achieve by coming?\" \"I am here to demand that such a rumour be publicly denied at once.\" \"Visiting Longbourn and speaking with me and my family,\" Elizabeth replied coolly, \"would actually seem to confirm the rumour—if it exists at all.\" \"If! So you claim not to know of it? Has it not been deliberately spread by you all? Are you unaware that it is being gossiped about everywhere?\" \"I've never heard of such a report.\" \"And can you also say there is absolutely no basis for it?\" \"I don't pretend to be as forthcoming as you, Lady Catherine.

From their infancy, they have been intended for each other. It was the favourite wish of his mother, as well as of hers. While in their cradles we planned the union; and now, at the moment when the wishes of both sisters would be accomplished, is their marriage to be prevented by a young woman of inferior birth, of no importance in the world, and wholly unallied to the family? Do you pay no regard to the wishes of his friends—to his tacit engagement with Miss de Bourgh? Are you lost to every feeling of propriety and delicacy? Have you not heard me say, that from his earliest hours he was destined for his cousin?”\n“Yes; and I had heard it before. But what is that to me? If there is no other objection to my marrying your nephew, I shall certainly not be kept from it by knowing that his mother and aunt wished him to marry Miss de Bourgh. You both did as much as you could in planning the marriage. Its completion depended on others. If Mr. Darcy is neither by honour nor inclination confined to his cousin, why is not he to make another choice? And if I am that choice, why may not I accept him?”\n“Because honour, decorum, prudence—nay, interest—forbid it. Yes, Miss Bennet, interest; for do not expect to be noticed by his family or friends, if you wilfully act against the inclinations of all. You will be censured, slighted, and despised, by everyone connected with him. Your alliance will be a disgrace; your name will never even be mentioned by any of us.”\n“These are heavy misfortunes,” replied Elizabeth. “But the wife of Mr. Darcy must have such extraordinary sources of happiness necessarily attached to her situation, that she could, upon the whole, have no cause to repine.”\n“Obstinate, headstrong girl! I am ashamed of you! Is this your gratitude for my attentions to you last spring? Is nothing due to me on that score? Let us sit down. You are to understand, Miss Bennet, that I came here with the determined resolution of carrying my purpose; nor will I be dissuaded from it. I have not been used to submit to any person’s whims.

You both did everything you could in planning the marriage. Its completion depended on others. If Mr. Darcy is not bound to his cousin by honour or personal wish, why shouldn't he make a different choice? And if I am that choice, why shouldn't I accept him?\" \"Because honour, decency, common sense—indeed, your own interest—forbid it. Yes, Miss Bennet, your interest; because do not expect to be acknowledged by his family or friends, if you deliberately act against everyone's preferences. You will be criticized, dismissed, and scorned, by everyone connected with him. Your union will be a disgrace; none of us will ever even mention your name.\" \"These are significant misfortunes,\" replied Elizabeth. \"But Mr. Darcy's wife must have such extraordinary causes for happiness inherently tied to her position, that overall, she would have no reason to feel discontented.\" \"Stubborn, wilful girl! I am ashamed of you! Is this your gratitude for the attention I showed you last spring? Do you owe me nothing for that? Let us sit down.

Perhaps you seduced him?\"\n\n\"If I have, I would hardly admit it.\"\n\n\"Miss Bennet, do you realize who I am? I'm not accustomed to being spoken to like this. I'm almost his closest family, and therefore I deserve to know his most important affairs.\"\n\n\"But you have no right to know mine; and behaving this way won't persuade me to be more open.\"\n\n\"Let me be clear.

We planned their marriage when they were babies; and now, just as we're to see that wish granted, should their marriage be stopped by a young woman of lower birth, with no family connection? Do you care nothing for the wishes of his friends, or about his silent commitment to Miss de Bourgh? Are you entirely lacking in decency and delicacy? Didn't you hear me say he was pledged to his cousin since childhood?\"\n\n\"Yes, and I knew it before. But why does that matter to me? If that's the only objection to my marrying your nephew, I certainly won't let it stop me. You both made your wishes clear, but you couldn't make the marriage happen. If Mr. Darcy isn't bound by honor or feelings to his cousin, why can't he choose someone else? And if he chooses me, why shouldn't I accept him?\"\n\n\"Because honor, good manners, sense—for that matter, even your own self-interest—demand you don't. Don't expect to be accepted by his family or friends if you go against everyone's wishes. You'll be criticized, ignored, and despised by them all. Your marriage would bring disgrace; we would never even mention your name.\"\n\n\"Those are serious hardships,\" Elizabeth replied. \"But surely, being Mrs. Darcy would bring so much happiness that she couldn't possibly complain.\"\n\n\"Stubborn, obstinate girl! You shame me! This is how you repay my kindness to you last spring? Don't I deserve at least something in return? Sit down. You should know, Miss Bennet, that I came here determined to achieve my goal, and I won’t be talked out of it. I'm not used to indulging other people's whims.

They are descended, on the maternal side, from the same noble line; and, on the father’s, from respectable, honourable, and ancient, though untitled, families. Their fortune on both sides is splendid. They are destined for each other by the voice of every member of their respective houses; and what is to divide them?—the upstart pretensions of a young woman without family, connections, or fortune! Is this to be endured? But it must not, shall not be! If you were sensible of your own good, you would not wish to quit the sphere in which you have been brought up.”\n“In marrying your nephew, I should not consider myself as quitting that sphere. He is a gentleman; I am a gentleman’s daughter; so far we are equal.”\n“True. You are a gentleman’s daughter. But what was your mother? Who are your uncles and aunts? Do not imagine me ignorant of their condition.”\n“Whatever my connections may be,” said Elizabeth, “if your nephew does not object to them, they can be nothing to you.”\n“Tell me, once for all, are you engaged to him?”\nThough Elizabeth would not, for the mere purpose of obliging Lady Catherine, have answered this question, she could not but say, after a moment’s deliberation,—\n“I am not.”\nLady Catherine seemed pleased.\n“And will you promise me never to enter into such an engagement?”\n“I will make no promise of the kind.”\n“Miss Bennet, I am shocked and astonished. I expected to find a more reasonable young woman. But do not deceive yourself into a belief that I will ever recede. I shall not go away till you have given me the assurance I require.”\n“And I certainly never shall give it. I am not to be intimidated into anything so wholly unreasonable. Your Ladyship wants Mr. Darcy to marry your daughter; but would my giving you the wished-for promise make their marriage at all more probable? Supposing him to be attached to me, would my refusing to accept his hand make him wish to bestow it on his cousin? Allow me to say, Lady Catherine, that the arguments with which you have supported this extraordinary application have been as frivolous as the application was ill-judged. You have widely mistaken my character, if you think I can be worked on by such persuasions as these. How far your nephew might approve of your interference in his affairs, I cannot tell; but you have certainly no right to concern yourself in mine. I must beg, therefore, to be importuned no further on the subject.”\n“Not so hasty, if you please. I have by no means done. To all the objections I have already urged I have still another to add. I am no stranger to the particulars of your youngest sister’s infamous elopement. I know it all; that the young man’s marrying her was a patched-up business, at the expense of your father and uncle. And is such a girl to be my nephew’s sister? Is her husband, who is the son of his late father’s steward, to be his brother? Heaven and earth!—of what are you thinking? Are the shades of Pemberley to be thus polluted?”\n“You can now have nothing further to say,” she resentfully answered. “You have insulted me, in every possible method. I must beg to return to the house.”\nAnd she rose as she spoke. Lady Catherine rose also, and they turned back. Her Ladyship was highly incensed.\n“You have no regard, then, for the honour and credit of my nephew! Unfeeling, selfish girl! Do you not consider that a connection with you must disgrace him in the eyes of everybody?”\n“Lady Catherine, I have nothing further to say. You know my sentiments.”\n“You are then resolved to have him?”\n“I have said no such thing. I am only resolved to act in that manner, which will, in my own opinion, constitute my happiness, without reference to you, or to any person so wholly unconnected with me.”\n“It is well. You refuse, then, to oblige me. You refuse to obey the claims of duty, honour, and gratitude. You are determined to ruin him in the opinion of all his friends, and make him the contempt of the world.”\n“Neither duty, nor honour, nor gratitude,” replied Elizabeth, “has any possible claim on me, in the present instance. No principle of either would be violated by my marriage with Mr. Darcy. And with regard to the resentment of his family, or the indignation of the world, if the former were excited by his marrying me, it would not give me one moment’s concern—and the world in general would have too much sense to join in the scorn.”\n“And this is your real opinion! This is your final resolve! Very well. I shall now know how to act. Do not imagine, Miss Bennet, that your ambition will ever be gratified. I came to try you. I hoped to find you reasonable; but depend upon it I will carry my point.”\nIn this manner Lady Catherine talked on till they were at the door of the carriage, when, turning hastily round, she added,—\n“I take no leave of you, Miss Bennet. I send no compliments to your mother. You deserve no such attention. I am most seriously displeased.”\nElizabeth made no answer; and without attempting to persuade her Ladyship to return into the house, walked quietly into it herself. She heard the carriage drive away as she proceeded upstairs. Her mother impatiently met her at the door of her dressing-room, to ask why Lady Catherine would not come in again and rest herself.\n“She did not choose it,” said her daughter; “she would go.”\n“She is a very fine-looking woman! and her calling here was prodigiously civil! for she only came, I suppose, to tell us the Collinses were well. She is on her road somewhere, I dare say; and so, passing through Meryton, thought she might as well call on you. I suppose she had nothing particular to say to you, Lizzy?”\nElizabeth was forced to give in to a little falsehood here; for to acknowledge the substance of their conversation was impossible.",

She emphasized their shared noble maternal lineage and their respectable, though untitled, paternal ancestry. Their combined wealth was impressive, and according to their families, they were destined to marry. She then asked what could possibly prevent their union, suggesting it could only be the presumptuous claims of a young woman like Elizabeth, who lacked family connections, social standing, and fortune. She found this situation intolerable and insisted it would not happen. She advised Elizabeth that if she had any sense, she would not aspire to leave the social class she was raised in.\nElizabeth responded that marrying Mr. Darcy would not be leaving her class, as he was a gentleman and she the daughter of a gentleman, placing them on equal footing in that regard.\nLady Catherine conceded that Elizabeth was indeed a gentleman's daughter but immediately challenged her on her mother's background and the status of her aunts and uncles, making it clear she was aware of their lower standing.\nElizabeth retorted that her connections were irrelevant; if Mr. Darcy himself didn't object to them, they were certainly none of Lady Catherine's concern.\nLady Catherine then directly demanded to know if Elizabeth was engaged to Mr. Darcy.\nAfter a moment's thought, Elizabeth replied truthfully, though not solely to satisfy Lady Catherine, that she was not engaged.\nLady Catherine appeared momentarily pleased.\nShe then pressed further, asking if Elizabeth would promise never to enter into such an engagement.\nElizabeth refused to make any such promise.\nLady Catherine expressed shock and dismay, calling Elizabeth unreasonable. She insisted she would not relent and would remain until Elizabeth gave her the required assurance.\nElizabeth firmly stated she would never give it, refusing to be coerced into something so utterly unreasonable. She pointed out that Lady Catherine's goal was for Mr. Darcy to marry her daughter, but Elizabeth's promise wouldn't make that marriage more likely. She used logic: if Mr. Darcy loved her, her refusal to marry him wouldn't make him want to marry his cousin instead. Elizabeth told Lady Catherine that the arguments supporting her extraordinary demand were trivial and the demand itself ill-judged. She felt Lady Catherine had completely misread her character if she thought such tactics would influence her. Elizabeth added that she couldn't say how Mr. Darcy would view this interference in his personal matters, but Lady Catherine certainly had no right to interfere in hers. She therefore requested to be bothered no further on the subject.\nLady Catherine refused to stop, saying she had more to say. She revealed she was fully aware of the scandalous details surrounding Elizabeth's youngest sister's unfortunate elopement, including the fact that the subsequent marriage was hastily arranged and funded by Elizabeth's father and uncle. She exclaimed in horror at the thought of such a girl becoming her nephew's sister and her husband, the son of his late father's steward, becoming his brother-in-law, asking if the very reputation of Pemberley should be tainted in this way.\nDeeply offended, Elizabeth responded resentfully that Lady Catherine had exhausted every possible method of insult and had nothing left to say. She asked to return to the house.\nAs Elizabeth rose to leave, Lady Catherine also rose, and they walked back together. Lady Catherine was visibly furious.\nShe accused Elizabeth of being unfeeling and selfish, having no regard for her nephew's honour and reputation, suggesting a connection with Elizabeth would disgrace him publicly.\nElizabeth reiterated that she had nothing more to say and that Lady Catherine already knew her feelings.\nLady Catherine interpreted this as Elizabeth being determined to marry him.\nElizabeth corrected her, stating she had not said that. She was simply resolved to act in the way she believed would secure her own happiness, without regard for Lady Catherine or anyone else entirely unconnected to her.\nLady Catherine acknowledged this, interpreting it as a refusal to comply and an unwillingness to respect duty, honour, and gratitude. She accused Elizabeth of being intent on ruining Mr. Darcy's standing with his friends and making him an object of scorn globally.\nElizabeth calmly countered that duty, honour, and gratitude had no claim on her in this specific situation, and her marriage to Mr. Darcy would violate no such principle. As for his family's potential anger or the world's disapproval, she stated she wouldn't be bothered by the former, and the world would have enough sense not to join in the latter.\nLady Catherine confirmed this was Elizabeth's final position and resolve. She declared she now knew how to proceed and warned Elizabeth not to believe her ambition would ever be fulfilled. She repeated that she had come to test Elizabeth, hoping to find her reasonable, but was now determined to achieve her goal.\nLady Catherine continued speaking in this manner until they reached her carriage. There, she turned abruptly and announced she would not take leave of Elizabeth or send compliments to her mother, stating Elizabeth deserved no such civility and that she was extremely displeased.\nElizabeth remained silent. Without attempting to persuade Lady Catherine to return inside, she quietly entered the house herself. As she went upstairs, she heard the carriage driving away. Her mother met her impatiently at her dressing-room door, eager to know why Lady Catherine had not come back in to rest.\nElizabeth simply replied that Lady Catherine did not wish to and chose to leave.\nMrs. Bennet remarked on Lady Catherine's appearance and called her visit remarkably polite, assuming she had merely stopped by to report on the Collinses' well-being while passing through Meryton on her way somewhere else, and had likely nothing specific to discuss with Elizabeth.\nElizabeth was forced to tell a slight untruth here, as revealing the details of their intense conversation was impossible.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "Lady Catherine insisted on being heard without interruption, declaring that her daughter and nephew were meant for each other due to their shared noble heritage and substantial fortunes. She protested that nothing should come between them, especially not the ambitions of a young woman like Elizabeth, who lacked notable family, wealth, or connections, and urged Elizabeth to remain in her social class. Elizabeth replied that marriage to Mr. Darcy would not take her out of her sphere, as they were socially equal. Lady Catherine disparaged Elizabeth's relatives, to which Elizabeth responded that her connections were irrelevant if Darcy accepted them. Pressed to admit if she was engaged to Darcy, Elizabeth stated she was not. Lady Catherine tried to elicit a promise that Elizabeth would never enter such an engagement, but Elizabeth refused. Indignant, Lady Catherine insisted she would not leave until Elizabeth vowed never to marry Darcy, but Elizabeth stood firm, rejecting such pressure and arguing that Lady Catherine's reasoning was weak. Lady Catherine then cited the disgrace caused by Elizabeth's youngest sister's scandalous elopement, questioning if such a family should be connected to her nephew. Elizabeth, feeling insulted, declared the conversation over and left to return to the house, with Lady Catherine angrily following. Accusing Elizabeth of endangering her nephew's reputation, Lady Catherine demanded once more that Elizabeth heed her. Elizabeth reiterated her intention only to pursue her own happiness, regardless of Lady Catherine's wishes. Lady Catherine ended the confrontation, promising not to let Elizabeth's ambitions succeed, and departed without civility. Elizabeth, declining to invite Lady Catherine back into the house, let her leave and told her mother nothing of the true reason for the visit, instead allowing her mother to assume Lady Catherine had simply stopped by with polite intentions."

          "text_segment": "The discomposure of spirits which this extraordinary visit threw Elizabeth into could not be easily overcome; nor could she for many hours learn to think of it less than incessantly. Lady Catherine, it appeared, had actually taken the trouble of this journey from Rosings for the sole purpose of breaking off her supposed engagement with Mr. Darcy. It was a rational scheme, to be sure! but from what the report of their engagement could originate, Elizabeth was at a loss to imagine; till she recollected that his being the intimate friend of Bingley, and her being the sister of Jane, was enough, at a time when the expectation of one wedding made everybody eager for another, to supply the idea. She had not herself forgotten to feel that the marriage of her sister must bring them more frequently together. And her neighbours at Lucas Lodge, therefore, (for through their communication with the Collinses, the report, she concluded, had reached Lady Catherine,) had only set that down as almost certain and immediate which she had looked forward to as possible at some future time.\nIn revolving Lady Catherine’s expressions, however, she could not help feeling some uneasiness as to the possible consequence of her persisting in this interference. From what she had said of her resolution to prevent the marriage, it occurred to Elizabeth that she must meditate an application to her nephew; and how he might take a similar representation of the evils attached to a connection with her she dared not pronounce. She knew not the exact degree of his affection for his aunt, or his dependence on her judgment, but it was natural to suppose that he thought much higher of her Ladyship than she could do; and it was certain, that in enumerating the miseries of a marriage with one whose immediate connections were so unequal to his own, his aunt would address him on his weakest side. With his notions of dignity, he would probably feel that the arguments, which to Elizabeth had appeared weak and ridiculous, contained much good sense and solid reasoning.\nIf he had been wavering before, as to what he should do, which had often seemed likely, the advice and entreaty of so near a relation might settle every doubt, and determine him at once to be as happy as dignity unblemished could make him. In that case he would return no more. Lady Catherine might see him in her way through town; and his engagement to Bingley of coming again to Netherfield must give way.\n“If, therefore, an excuse for not keeping his promise should come to his friend within a few days,” she added, “I shall know how to understand it. I shall then give over every expectation, every wish of his constancy. If he is satisfied with only regretting me, when he might have obtained my affections and hand, I shall soon cease to regret him at all.”",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "The profound emotional upset caused by this unexpected visit from Lady Catherine was difficult for Elizabeth to recover from; for many hours, she found it impossible to think about anything else. It seemed Lady Catherine had actually undertaken the journey from Rosings solely to intervene and prevent the engagement she believed existed between Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy. Elizabeth found this plan quite ludicrous, though she struggled to understand where the rumour of their engagement could have originated. It then occurred to her that Darcy's close friendship with Bingley and her status as Jane's sister was enough, especially at a time when the anticipation of one wedding made everyone hopeful for another, to fuel such speculation. She herself hadn't failed to realise that her sister's marriage would naturally lead to more frequent interactions between them. Her neighbours at Lucas Lodge, therefore (she surmised the report reached Lady Catherine via their connections with the Collinses), had simply taken what she considered a distant possibility and presented it as an almost certain and immediate fact.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "Elizabeth was deeply unsettled by Lady Catherine’s unexpected visit and struggled to stop thinking about it for hours. She realized Lady Catherine had come all the way from Rosings just to try to break off her supposed engagement to Mr. Darcy. While this seemed logical, Elizabeth couldn’t initially imagine how such a rumor started, until she remembered that Darcy’s close friendship with Bingley, and her own sister Jane’s relationship with Bingley, might have prompted the idea—especially with everyone excited about an upcoming wedding. Elizabeth herself had even considered that her sister’s marriage would bring Darcy and her together more often. She also reasoned that the neighbors at Lucas Lodge, who communicated with the Collinses, could have easily passed on this information to Lady Catherine, interpreting what Elizabeth saw as a possible future event as something imminent and certain.\n\nReflecting on Lady Catherine’s words, Elizabeth felt worried about what might happen if Lady Catherine persisted with her interference. Lady Catherine had made it clear she intended to stop the marriage, and Elizabeth thought she might appeal to Darcy directly. Elizabeth wasn’t sure how Darcy felt about his aunt or how much he depended on her opinions, but she figured it was likely he valued Lady Catherine’s judgment more than Elizabeth did. Lady Catherine would also probably focus on the disparity in their social connections when talking to Darcy, which Elizabeth knew might influence his sense of dignity more than it impressed her. Arguments that Elizabeth found silly might seem reasonable to Darcy.\n\nIf Darcy had been unsure about his feelings before, Lady Catherine’s advice as a close relative might convince him to abandon the idea of marrying Elizabeth and instead prioritize his reputation. That would mean he wouldn’t come back, and Lady Catherine might see him as she traveled through town. His promise to visit Bingley at Netherfield would be forgotten.\n\nElizabeth decided that if Bingley soon received an excuse for Darcy’s absence, she would understand the reason. In that case, she would stop hoping for Darcy’s loyalty; if he was content with only feeling regret for losing her, instead of pursuing her when he had the chance, Elizabeth would quickly stop regretting him in return."

Your daughter Elizabeth, it is presumed, will not long bear the name of Bennet, after her eldest sister has resigned it; and the chosen partner of her fate may be reasonably looked up to as one of the most illustrious personages in this land.’ Can you possibly guess, Lizzy, who is meant by this? ‘This young gentleman is blessed, in a peculiar way, with everything the heart of mortal can most desire,—splendid property, noble kindred, and extensive patronage. Yet, in spite of all these temptations, let me warn my cousin Elizabeth, and yourself, of what evils you may incur by a precipitate closure with this gentleman’s proposals, which, of course, you will be inclined to take immediate advantage of.’ Have you any idea, Lizzy, who this gentleman is? But now it comes out. ‘My motive for cautioning you is as follows:—We have reason to imagine that his aunt, Lady Catherine de Bourgh, does not look on the match with a friendly eye.’ Mr. Darcy, you see, is the man! Now, Lizzy, I think I have surprised you. Could he, or the Lucases, have pitched on any man, within the circle of our acquaintance, whose name would have given the lie more effectually to what they related?

Young women are very insightful about these matters; but I believe I can challenge even your cleverness to figure out your admirer’s name. This letter is from Mr. Collins.” “From Mr. Collins!

Your daughter Elizabeth, it is presumed, will not retain the name Bennet for long after her elder sister has changed hers; and the man she has chosen may reasonably be considered one of the most distinguished individuals in this country.’ Can you possibly guess, Lizzy, who this refers to? ‘This young gentleman is uniquely fortunate, possessing everything a person could possibly desire—great wealth, noble family connections, and extensive influence. However, despite these advantages, let me caution my cousin Elizabeth and yourself about the potential problems you might face by hastily accepting this gentleman’s offer, which, undoubtedly, you will be eager to embrace immediately.’ Do you have any idea, Lizzy, who this gentleman is? But now it becomes clear. ‘My reason for warning you is as follows:—We have cause to believe that his aunt, Lady Catherine de Bourgh, does not approve of the match.’ Mr. Darcy, you see, is the man! Now, Lizzy, I think I have genuinely surprised you. Could he, or the Lucases, have named any man within our acquaintance whose name would more thoroughly contradict their account?

Your daughter Elizabeth, it appears, will soon stop being a Bennet, after her sister does, and her future husband may well be one of the most distinguished persons in the country.’ Can you guess who this is, Lizzy? ‘This young man is exceptionally fortunate—he has great wealth, noble family ties, and wide influence. Still, despite all these attractions, let me caution both you and Elizabeth about any harm that might come from too quickly accepting this proposal, which you might be eager to do.’ Do you have any idea who this gentleman is, Lizzy? Now here's the answer. ‘The reason I warn you is that we understand his aunt, Lady Catherine de Bourgh, apparently doesn't support the match.’ Mr. Darcy, you see, is who he means! Now, Lizzy, I think I've surprised you. Could he or the Lucases have chosen anyone in our social circle whose name would more thoroughly contradict their story?

I thought it my duty to give the speediest intelligence of this to my cousin, that she and her noble admirer may be aware of what they are about, and not run hastily into a marriage which has not been properly sanctioned.’ Mr. Collins, moreover, adds, ‘I am truly rejoiced that my cousin Lydia’s sad business has been so well hushed up, and am only concerned that their living together before the marriage took place should be so generally known. I must not, however, neglect the duties of my station, or refrain from declaring my amazement, at hearing that you received the young couple into your house as soon as they were married. It was an encouragement of vice; and had I been the rector of Longbourn, I should very strenuously have opposed it. You ought certainly to forgive them as a Christian, but never to admit them in your sight, or allow their names to be mentioned in your hearing.’ That is his notion of Christian forgiveness! The rest of his letter is only about his dear Charlotte’s situation, and his expectation of a young olive-branch. But, Lizzy, you look as if you did not enjoy it. You are not going to be missish, I hope, and pretend to be affronted at an idle report. For what do we live, but to make sport for our neighbours, and laugh at them in our turn?”\n“Oh,” cried Elizabeth, “I am exceedingly diverted. But it is so strange!”\n“Yes, that is what makes it amusing. Had they fixed on any other man it would have been nothing; but his perfect indifference and your pointed dislike make it so delightfully absurd! Much as I abominate writing, I would not give up Mr. Collins’s correspondence for any consideration. Nay, when I read a letter of his, I cannot help giving him the preference even over Wickham, much as I value the impudence and hypocrisy of my son-in-law. And pray, Lizzy, what said Lady Catherine about this report? Did she call to refuse her consent?”\nTo this question his daughter replied only with a laugh; and as it had been asked without the least suspicion, she was not distressed by his repeating it. Elizabeth had never been more at a loss to make her feelings appear what they were not. It was necessary to laugh when she would rather have cried. Her father had most cruelly mortified her by what he said of Mr. Darcy’s indifference; and she could do nothing but wonder at such a want of penetration, or fear that, perhaps, instead of his seeing too little, she might have fancied too much.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "Elizabeth attempted to match her father's cheerful mood, but could only manage a single, very strained smile. His wit had never been directed in a way that pleased her so little. \"Are you not amused?\" \"Oh, yes. Please keep reading.\" \"'After mentioning the likelihood of this marriage to her Ladyship yesterday evening, she immediately, with her characteristic graciousness, expressed her feelings on the matter; at which point it became clear that, due to certain family objections on my cousin's side, she would never give her approval to what she termed such a shameful match. I felt it was my duty to inform my cousin of this as quickly as possible, so that she and her distinguished admirer might be aware of their situation and not rush into a marriage that has not received proper authorization.' Mr. Collins also adds, 'I am genuinely pleased that my cousin Lydia’s unfortunate business was so effectively concealed, and my only concern is that their living together before the marriage occurred is so widely known. However, I must not neglect the duties of my position, nor refrain from expressing my astonishment at hearing that you welcomed the young couple into your home as soon as they were married. It was an encouragement of vice; and had I been the rector of Longbourn, I would have strongly opposed it. As a Christian, you should certainly forgive them, but you should never let them into your sight, or allow their names to be spoken in your hearing.' That is his idea of Christian forgiveness! The rest of his letter is simply about his dear Charlotte's condition and his hope for a new child. But, Lizzy, you look as if you don't find it amusing. You're not going to get sensitive, I hope, and pretend to be offended by a silly rumour. What is the purpose of life, if not to entertain our neighbours and then laugh at them in return?\" \"Oh,\" cried Elizabeth, \"I am extremely amused. But it is so strange!\" \"Yes, that is precisely what makes it funny. If they had chosen any other man, it would have meant nothing; but his absolute lack of interest and your clear dislike make it so wonderfully absurd! As much as I hate writing, I would not trade Mr. Collins’s letters for anything. Indeed, when I read one of his letters, I cannot help preferring him even over Wickham, much as I appreciate my son-in-law's insolence and dishonesty. And tell me, Lizzy, what did Lady Catherine say about this report? Did she visit to refuse her consent?\" His daughter replied to this question only with a laugh. As the question had been asked without the slightest suspicion, she was not distressed by him repeating it. Elizabeth had never found it harder to make her feelings appear contrary to what they were. She was forced to laugh when she would much rather have cried. Her father had profoundly hurt her with what he said about Mr. Darcy’s indifference; and she could only wonder at such a lack of understanding, or fear that, perhaps, instead of him seeing too little, she might have imagined too much.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "Elizabeth tried to laugh along with her father's jokes, but she could only manage a forced, reluctant smile; his humor had never seemed less pleasant to her. \n\n\"Aren't you amused?\" he asked. \n\n\"Oh, yes. Please, read on,\" she replied. \n\nHe continued reading Mr. Collins's letter, in which Collins explains that after talking to Lady Catherine about the possible marriage, she responded as usual, expressing her feelings on the matter with her usual condescension, making it clear she would never approve of what she considered such a disgraceful connection due to some family objections. Collins felt it was his duty to inform Elizabeth quickly, so she and her 'noble admirer' would be aware of Lady Catherine's opposition and not rush into an unsanctioned match. \n\nCollins went on to say he was happy that Lydia's recent trouble was well concealed, but regretted that her and Wickham's living together before marriage was so widely known. He felt it necessary to express his surprise that the young couple had been immediately received into the Bennet home as soon as they were married. He called it an encouragement of vice and claimed that if he were the clergyman at Longbourn he would have strongly opposed it. He thought they should be forgiven as Christians, but never received or mentioned again. \n\nMr. Bennet then remarked that this was Collins's idea of Christian forgiveness! The rest of the letter was just about Charlotte and the expectation of a child. He noted Elizabeth did not look amused and hoped she wasn't offended by such gossip, saying that people exist to provide amusement for each other. \n\nElizabeth replied that she was very entertained, though she found it all very odd. Her father said that's what made it funny—if it had been anyone else, it wouldn't matter, but Darcy's lack of interest and Elizabeth's known dislike made it especially absurd. Though he disliked letters, Mr. Bennet said he valued Mr. Collins's correspondence above all, even finding it preferable to the hypocrisy of Wickham. Then he asked Lizzy if Lady Catherine had refused her consent.\n\nElizabeth answered with a laugh, since he was not serious and she was not upset by it. She had never found it so hard to hide her true feelings; she had to pretend to laugh when she really wanted to cry. Her father's comments about Darcy's indifference had deeply hurt her, and she wondered at his lack of understanding, or worried that maybe she had imagined too much herself."

Elizabeth soon discovered that their improved relationship was due to the intervention of Darcy's aunt, who had visited him in London after her trip to Longbourn. She recounted her journey, her reasons for it, and everything she said to Elizabeth, emphasizing every remark that, in her opinion, showed Elizabeth's stubbornness and boldness. She believed this account would persuade Darcy to make the promise she wanted, which Elizabeth had refused, but, unfortunately for the aunt, it had the opposite effect. \n\nDarcy explained, \"Hearing about your conversation made me hope in a way I hadn't before. I was sure that if you had truly decided against me, you would have told Lady Catherine honestly.\" \n\nElizabeth blushed and laughed, replying, \"You know me well enough to believe that. Having criticized you so harshly to your face, I wouldn't hesitate to do the same with your relatives.\"\n\nDarcy responded, \"Did you say anything about me that I didn't deserve? Even though your accusations were based on misunderstandings, my actions at that time deserved harsh criticism. My behavior was unforgivable, and I can't think of it without shame.\"\n\nElizabeth said, \"Let's not argue over who was more at fault that evening. Neither of us behaved perfectly if we look closely, but I hope we've both become more civil since then.\"\n\nDarcy admitted, \"I can’t forgive myself so quickly. Remembering my words and actions from that night still causes me great pain. Your criticism—'Had you behaved in a more gentlemanlike manner'—continues to affect me deeply, though it took me a while to accept its fairness.\"\n\nElizabeth replied, \"I never expected my words to have such a deep impact.\""

The turn of your countenance I shall never forget, as you said that I could not have addressed you in any possible way that would induce you to accept me.”\n“Oh, do not repeat what I then said. These recollections will not do at all. I assure you that I have long been most heartily ashamed of it.”\nDarcy mentioned his letter. “Did it,” said he,—“did it soon make you think better of me? Did you, on reading it, give any credit to its contents?”\nShe explained what its effects on her had been, and how gradually all her former prejudices had been removed.\n“I knew,” said he, “that what I wrote must give you pain, but it was necessary. I hope you have destroyed the letter. There was one part, especially the opening of it, which I should dread your having the power of reading again. I can remember some expressions which might justly make you hate me.”\n“The letter shall certainly be burnt, if you believe it essential to the preservation of my regard; but, though we have both reason to think my opinions not entirely unalterable, they are not, I hope, quite so easily changed as that implies.”\n“When I wrote that letter,” replied Darcy, “I believed myself perfectly calm and cool; but I am since convinced that it was written in a dreadful bitterness of spirit.”\n“The letter, perhaps, began in bitterness, but it did not end so. The adieu is charity itself. But think no more of the letter. The feelings of the person who wrote and the person who received it are now so widely different from what they were then, that every unpleasant circumstance attending it ought to be forgotten. You must learn some of my philosophy. Think only of the past as its remembrance gives you pleasure.”\n“I cannot give you credit for any philosophy of the kind. Your retrospections must be so totally void of reproach, that the contentment arising from them is not of philosophy, but, what is much better, of ignorance. But with me, it is not so. Painful recollections will intrude, which cannot, which ought not to be repelled. I have been a selfish being all my life, in practice, though not in principle. As a child I was taught what was right, but I was not taught to correct my temper. I was given good principles, but left to follow them in pride and conceit. Unfortunately an only son (for many years an only child), I was spoiled by my parents, who, though good themselves, (my father particularly, all that was benevolent and amiable,) allowed, encouraged, almost taught me to be selfish and overbearing, to care for none beyond my own family circle, to think meanly of all the rest of the world, to wish at least to think meanly of their sense and worth compared with my own. Such I was, from eight to eight-and-twenty; and such I might still have been but for you, dearest, loveliest Elizabeth! What do I not owe you! You taught me a lesson, hard indeed at first, but most advantageous. By you, I was properly humbled. I came to you without a doubt of my reception. You showed me how insufficient were all my pretensions to please a woman worthy of being pleased.”\n“Had you then persuaded yourself that I should?”\n“Indeed I had. What will you think of my vanity? I believed you to be wishing, expecting my addresses.”\n“My manners must have been in fault, but not intentionally, I assure you. I never meant to deceive you, but my spirits might often lead me wrong. How you must have hated me after that evening!”\n“Hate you! I was angry, perhaps, at first, but my anger soon began to take a proper direction.”\n“I am almost afraid of asking what you thought of me when we met at Pemberley. You blamed me for coming?”\n“No, indeed, I felt nothing but surprise.”\n“Your surprise could not be greater than mine in being noticed by you. My conscience told me that I deserved no extraordinary politeness, and I confess that I did not expect to receive more than my due.”\n“My object then,” replied Darcy, “was to show you, by every civility in my power, that I was not so mean as to resent the past; and I hoped to obtain your forgiveness, to lessen your ill opinion, by letting you see that your reproofs had been attended to. How soon any other wishes introduced themselves, I can hardly tell, but I believe in about half an hour after I had seen you.”\nHe then told her of Georgiana’s delight in her acquaintance, and of her disappointment at its sudden interruption; which naturally leading to the cause of that interruption, she soon learnt that his resolution of following her from Derbyshire in quest of her sister had been formed before he quitted the inn, and that his gravity and thoughtfulness there had arisen from no other struggles than what such a purpose must comprehend.",

I’m sure you thought I lacked all proper feelings back then. I will never forget the look on your face when you told me there was no way I could have proposed that would make you accept me.”\n“Oh, please don’t repeat what I said then. Those memories are too painful. I assure you I have been most heartily ashamed of it for a long time.”\nDarcy brought up his letter. “Did it,” he asked, “did it soon improve your opinion of me? When you read it, did you believe what it contained?”\nShe explained how it had affected her and how her former negative impressions had gradually faded away.\n“I knew,” he said, “that what I wrote would cause you pain, but it had to be said. I hope you have destroyed the letter. There was one part, especially the beginning, that I would dread you reading again. I can recall certain phrases that might justly make you despise me.”\n“The letter will certainly be burned if you think it’s essential to keep my regard; but, though we both know my opinions are not entirely unchanging, they are not, I hope, quite as easily swayed as that would imply.”\n“When I wrote that letter,” Darcy replied, “I thought I was perfectly calm and rational; but I am now convinced it was written with terrible bitterness.”\n“The letter may have started with bitterness, but it didn’t end that way. The farewell is kindness itself. But let’s not think about the letter anymore. The feelings of the writer and the receiver are now so different from what they were then, that every unpleasant detail about it should be forgotten. You must adopt some of my philosophy. Only remember the past if the memory gives you pleasure.”\n“I cannot claim to possess any such philosophy. Your memories must be so entirely free from self-reproach that the contentment they bring comes not from philosophy, but, much better, from a lack of fault. But for me, it is not like that. Painful memories intrude, which cannot, and should not, be pushed away. I have been selfish my whole life in action, though not in principle. As a child, I was taught what was right, but not how to control my temper. I was given good principles but left to follow them with pride and arrogance. Unfortunately, as an only son (for many years an only child), I was spoiled by my parents, who, though good people themselves (my father especially, was entirely benevolent and kind), allowed, encouraged, almost trained me to be selfish and overbearing, to care only for those within my own family, to think poorly of everyone else in the world, to at least wish to think poorly of their sense and worth compared to my own. That was me, from age eight to twenty-eight; and that is how I might still be if not for you, dearest, loveliest Elizabeth! How much I owe you! You taught me a lesson, difficult at first, but ultimately most beneficial. Because of you, I was properly humbled. I approached you without a doubt of being accepted. You showed me how inadequate all my claims were to please a woman worthy of being pleased.”\n“Had you then convinced yourself that I would?”\n“Indeed I had. What do you think of my conceit? I believed you were hoping for and expecting my proposal.”\n“My manners must have been at fault, but not deliberately, I assure you. I never intended to mislead you, but my mood or spirits might often have led me astray. How much you must have hated me after that evening!”\n“Hate you! I was perhaps angry initially, but my anger soon found a more suitable target.”\n“I am almost afraid to ask what you thought of me when we met at Pemberley. Did you blame me for being there?”\n“No, indeed, I felt nothing but surprise.”\n“Your surprise couldn't have been greater than mine at your acknowledgement of me. My conscience told me I didn’t deserve any special politeness, and I confess I didn’t expect to receive more than I was due.”\n“My goal then,” Darcy replied, “was to show you, by every courtesy I could offer, that I wasn’t petty enough to hold a grudge about the past; and I hoped to gain your forgiveness, to improve your low opinion, by demonstrating that I had taken your criticisms to heart. How soon any other desires emerged, I can barely say, but I believe it was about half an hour after I had seen you.”\nHe then told her how delighted Georgiana was by her acquaintance and how disappointed she was when it ended so suddenly. This naturally led to discussing the reason for that interruption, and she soon learned that his decision to follow her from Derbyshire to find her sister had been made before he left the inn, and that his seriousness and thoughtfulness there were due only to the challenges involved in that plan.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "I had no idea such feelings could exist.\"\n\"I believe you. At the time, you must have thought me lacking in proper emotions. I will never forget the look on your face when you said I couldn't have proposed in any way that would have made you accept me.\"\n\"Please, don't repeat what I said then. Remembering it is not helpful. Honestly, I've been deeply ashamed of it for a long time.\"\nDarcy brought up his letter. \"Did it—did it quickly change your mind about me? Did you believe what I wrote?\"\nShe explained how the letter affected her, and how it gradually helped her set aside her previous biases.\n\"I knew my letter would pain you, but it was necessary. I hope you've destroyed it. There's one part, especially at the beginning, that I dread you having the chance to read again. I remember phrases in it that could have made you hate me.\"\n\"The letter will certainly be burned, if you think that’s essential to preserve my affection.

The farewell was full of kindness. But let’s not think about the letter. Our feelings then were so different from how we feel now, that all we remember about it should be forgotten. You should learn from me: only think of the past if it brings you happiness.\"\n\"I can’t say I possess that kind of wisdom. Your memories must be free from guilt, so your satisfaction comes not from philosophy, but from ignorance—which is better. But not for me. Painful memories persist and shouldn’t be pushed away. I’ve been selfish all my life—though I had good principles as a child, no one taught me to control my temper. My parents spoiled me—especially since I was an only son—and although kind themselves, they let me become proud and selfish, caring for few outside my family and believing myself superior. I would still be like that, except for you, Elizabeth. What do I not owe you! You taught me a hard lesson, but an important one. You humbled me when I was confident you’d accept me. You showed me all my efforts were not enough to truly win over someone worthy.\"\n\"Did you really expect I would accept you?\"\n\"I did. What must you think of my arrogance? I believed you wanted me to propose.\"\n\"If my behavior led you to think so, it was not intentional. I never meant to mislead you, though my spirits might have suggested otherwise.

I was upset at first, but my anger soon found its proper direction.\"\n\"I am almost afraid to ask what you thought of me when we met at Pemberley. Did you blame me for coming?\"\n\"No, I was just surprised.\"\n\"Not more than I was, being noticed by you. I knew I deserved nothing special, and I expected no more than necessary.\"\n\"My goal then,\" said Darcy, \"was to show you through every kindness that I did not resent the past. I wanted to earn your forgiveness, to soften your harsh opinion, and to show you your reproaches mattered to me. Any further hopes came not much later—in fact, probably half an hour after I first saw you.\"\nHe then spoke of Georgiana’s happiness in Elizabeth’s company and her disappointment when it ended so soon. This led naturally to the real reason for its interruption, and Elizabeth soon learned that Darcy had resolved to follow her from Derbyshire to help her sister even before leaving the inn, and his serious demeanor there was due only to his private struggles over this decision."

I had narrowly observed her, during the two visits which I had lately made her here; and I was convinced of her affection.”\n“And your assurance of it, I suppose, carried immediate conviction to him.”\n“It did. Bingley is most unaffectedly modest. His diffidence had prevented his depending on his own judgment in so anxious a case, but his reliance on mine made everything easy. I was obliged to confess one thing, which for a time, and not unjustly, offended him. I could not allow myself to conceal that your sister had been in town three months last winter, that I had known it, and purposely kept it from him. He was angry. But his anger, I am persuaded, lasted no longer than he remained in any doubt of your sister’s sentiments. He has heartily forgiven me now.”\nElizabeth longed to observe that Mr. Bingley had been a most delightful friend; so easily guided that his worth was invaluable; but she checked herself. She remembered that he had yet to learn to be laughed at, and it was rather too early to begin.

Darcy was very pleased about Bingley and Jane becoming engaged, as Bingley had told him the news early on. Elizabeth asked Darcy if he had been surprised. He replied that he wasn’t, as he had expected it would happen soon after he left. Elizabeth teased that he must have given his approval, and though Darcy protested at her wording, it was essentially true. Darcy explained that just before he left for London, he confessed to Bingley that all his previous concerns about their relationship were unfounded and inappropriate. Bingley had been quite surprised since he had no idea about Darcy's interference, and Darcy also told him that he was wrong to think Jane didn’t care for him. Seeing Bingley’s feelings for Jane had not lessened, Darcy believed they would be happy together. Elizabeth teased him about being so easily able to direct his friend’s actions, and asked if Darcy’s assurance to Bingley about Jane’s feelings was based on his own observations or what Elizabeth had told him in the spring. Darcy answered that it was from his recent observations at Longbourn that he was convinced of Jane's affection. Elizabeth supposed that Darcy’s opinion must have convinced Bingley immediately. Darcy agreed, saying that Bingley’s modest nature made him doubt his own judgment, but Bingley trusted Darcy's word. Darcy admitted he had to confess something that briefly angered Bingley: that Jane had been in London for three months and Darcy had kept it from him. Bingley was upset, but forgave Darcy once he was sure of Jane's feelings. Elizabeth wanted to comment that Bingley was a wonderful but easily influenced friend, but stopped herself, realizing Darcy might not appreciate the joke yet. They continued to talk, mostly about Bingley’s forthcoming happiness, until they reached the house, where they went their separate ways."

          "text_segment": "My dear Lizzy, where can you have been walking to?” was a question which Elizabeth received from Jane as soon as she entered the room, and from all the others when they sat down to table. She had only to say in reply, that they had wandered about till she was beyond her own knowledge. She coloured as she spoke; but neither that, nor anything else, awakened a suspicion of the truth.\nThe evening passed quietly, unmarked by anything extraordinary. The acknowledged lovers talked and laughed; the unacknowledged were silent. Darcy was not of a disposition in which happiness overflows in mirth; and Elizabeth, agitated and confused, rather knew that she was happy than felt herself to be so; for, besides the immediate embarrassment, there were other evils before her. She anticipated what would be felt in the family when her situation became known: she was aware that no one liked him but Jane; and even feared that with the others it was a dislike which not all his fortune and consequence might do away.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "Upon entering the room, Elizabeth was immediately asked by Jane, and later by everyone else at the table, where she had been walking. She simply replied that they had walked so far they were in unfamiliar territory, blushing as she spoke. However, neither her blush nor anything else she said or did caused anyone to suspect the truth. The rest of the evening unfolded peacefully, without any remarkable events. The engaged couple were talkative and cheerful, while Elizabeth and Darcy remained quiet. Darcy's personality wasn't given to outwardly displaying happiness through cheerfulness; and Elizabeth, feeling flustered and unsettled, was more intellectually aware of her happiness than she was experiencing it emotionally in that moment. This was because, in addition to the immediate awkwardness, she foresaw further difficulties. She worried about her family's reaction once her engagement was revealed, knowing that Jane was the only family member who approved of him, and fearing that the others' strong aversion might not be overcome by his wealth and social standing.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "As soon as Elizabeth came into the room, Jane asked her where she had been walking, and the others repeated the question at dinner. Elizabeth simply replied that they had wandered so much she lost track of where she was. She blushed as she answered, but nobody suspected the real reason. The evening went by uneventfully. The couples whose affection was publicly known talked and laughed, while those whose feelings were hidden kept quiet. Darcy was not the type to express happiness with humor, and although Elizabeth was unsettled and embarrassed, she was more aware that she should be happy than actually feeling it. Along with her immediate discomfort, she also worried about how her family would react when they learned about her situation: she knew that only Jane liked Darcy, while the others actively disliked him, and she feared that even his wealth and status would not change their opinions."

          "text_segment": "At night she opened her heart to Jane. Though suspicion was very far from Miss Bennet’s general habits, she was absolutely incredulous here.\n“You are joking, Lizzy. This cannot be! Engaged to Mr. Darcy! No, no, you shall not deceive me: I know it to be impossible.”\n“This is a wretched beginning, indeed! My sole dependence was on you; and I am sure nobody else will believe me, if you do not. Yet, indeed, I am in earnest. I speak nothing but the truth. He still loves me, and we are engaged.”\nJane looked at her doubtingly. “Oh, Lizzy! it cannot be. I know how much you dislike him.”\n“You know nothing of the matter. That is all to be forgot. Perhaps I did not always love him so well as I do now; but in such cases as these a good memory is unpardonable. This is the last time I shall ever remember it myself.”\nMiss Bennet still looked all amazement. Elizabeth again, and more seriously, assured her of its truth.\n“Good heaven! can it be really so? Yet now I must believe you,” cried Jane. “My dear, dear Lizzy, I would, I do congratulate you; but are you certain—forgive the question—are you quite certain that you can be happy with him?”\n“There can be no doubt of that. It is settled between us already that we are to be the happiest couple in the world. But are you pleased, Jane? Shall you like to have such a brother?”\n“Very, very much. Nothing could give either Bingley or myself more delight. But we considered it, we talked of it as impossible. And do you really love him quite well enough? Oh, Lizzy! do anything rather than marry without affection. Are you quite sure that you feel what you ought to do?”\n“Oh, yes! You will only think I feel more than I ought to do when I tell you all.”\n“What do you mean?”\n“Why, I must confess that I love him better than I do Bingley. I am afraid you will be angry.”\n“My dearest sister, now be, be serious. I want to talk very seriously. Let me know everything that I am to know without delay. Will you tell me how long you have loved him?”\n“It has been coming on so gradually, that I hardly know when it began; but I believe I must date it from my first seeing his beautiful grounds at Pemberley.”\nAnother entreaty that she would be serious, however, produced the desired effect; and she soon satisfied Jane by her solemn assurances of attachment. When convinced on that article, Miss Bennet had nothing further to wish.\n“Now I am quite happy,” said she, “for you will be as happy as myself. I always had a value for him. Were it for nothing but his love of you, I must always have esteemed him; but now, as Bingley’s friend and your husband, there can be only Bingley and yourself more dear to me. But, Lizzy, you have been very sly, very reserved with me. How little did you tell me of what passed at Pemberley and Lambton! I owe all that I know of it to another, not to you.”\nElizabeth told her the motives of her secrecy. She had been unwilling to mention Bingley; and the unsettled state of her own feelings had made her equally avoid the name of his friend: but now she would no longer conceal from her his share in Lydia’s marriage. All was acknowledged, and half the night spent in conversation.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "That evening, Elizabeth confessed her feelings to her sister, Jane. Jane, who rarely doubted anyone, found this announcement utterly unbelievable. \"You're teasing me, Lizzy. This can't be real! Engaged to Mr. Darcy! No, you aren't going to fool me; I know it's impossible.\" Elizabeth replied, \"This is a dreadful start! I relied entirely on you to believe me, and if you don't, I'm sure no one else will. But I am completely serious. I'm telling the absolute truth. He still cares for me, and we are engaged.\" Jane looked at her uncertainly. \"Oh, Lizzy! It's impossible. I know how strongly you disliked him.\" Elizabeth countered, \"You don't understand the situation at all. All that is behind us. Perhaps I didn't always love him as much as I do now; but in situations like this, remembering past feelings is wrong. This is the last time I'll ever recall it myself.\" Jane still appeared utterly astonished. Elizabeth repeated her assurance, this time more earnestly. \"Good heavens! Can it really be true? Yet, now I must believe you,\" Jane exclaimed. \"My dearest Lizzy, I do congratulate you; but are you sure—forgive me for asking—are you completely certain you can be happy with him?\" \"There's no question about that,\" Elizabeth responded. \"We've already agreed we're destined to be the happiest couple on earth. But are you pleased, Jane? Will you be happy to have him as a brother?\" \"Extremely, extremely happy. Nothing could bring Bingley and me greater joy. But we honestly thought it was impossible. And do you honestly love him enough? Oh, Lizzy! Do anything but marry without affection. Are you absolutely sure about your feelings?\" Elizabeth replied, \"Oh, yes! You'll only think my feelings are *more* than enough when I tell you everything.\" \"What do you mean?\" Jane asked. \"Well, I must admit that I love him more than I love Bingley. I'm worried you'll be upset.\" \"My dearest sister, please, *please* be serious now. I need to talk about this seriously. Tell me everything I need to know right away. How long have you been in love with him?\" Elizabeth initially joked, \"It's been developing so gradually, I barely know when it began; but I suppose I must date it from the moment I first saw his beautiful estate at Pemberley.\" However, Jane's renewed request for seriousness had the desired effect, and Elizabeth soon convinced her with solemn declarations of her affection. Once assured of this, Jane had no further concerns. \"Now I am completely happy,\" she said, \"because you will be as happy as I am. I always admired him. Even if only for his love for you, I would always have respected him; but now, as Bingley's friend and your husband, only Bingley and you can be dearer to me. But, Lizzy, you've been very secretive with me. You told me so little about what happened at Pemberley and Lambton! I found out about it from someone else, not from you.\" Elizabeth explained her reasons for her secrecy. She hadn't wanted to mention Bingley, and her own uncertain feelings had made her avoid mentioning Darcy's name as well. But now, she was ready to reveal his part in Lydia's marriage. Everything was confessed, and they spent half the night talking.",

Although Jane was not usually suspicious, she could not believe what Elizabeth told her. \"You must be joking, Lizzy. There's no way! Engaged to Mr. Darcy? No, you can't fool me; it's simply impossible!\" Elizabeth replied, \"This is a terrible start. I was counting on you to believe me, because if you don't, no one else will. But I am serious—I'm telling the truth. He still loves me, and we're engaged.\" Jane still doubted her. \"Lizzy, it can't be. I know how much you disliked him.\" Elizabeth answered, \"You don't really know the situation. That's all in the past and shouldn't be remembered. Maybe I didn't always love him as much as I do now, but it's wrong to dwell on that. This is the last time I'll bring it up.\" Jane remained shocked, so Elizabeth, more solemnly, insisted she was telling the truth. \"Good heavens, could it really be? I have to believe you,\" Jane exclaimed. \"Dear Lizzy, congratulations. But are you sure—please forgive me for asking—are you certain you can be happy with him?\" Elizabeth replied, \"There's no doubt. We've already agreed we'll be the happiest couple in the world. But are you happy, Jane? Will you like such a brother?\" Jane said, \"Very much. Nothing could make Bingley or me happier. But we always thought it was impossible. And do you love him enough? Oh, Lizzy, do anything except marry without love. Are you sure you feel the way you should?\" Elizabeth assured her, \"Yes! In fact, when I tell you everything, you'll think I feel more than enough.\" Jane asked, \"What do you mean?\" Elizabeth confessed, \"I love him even more than you love Bingley. I hope that doesn't upset you.\" Jane urged her to be serious and to tell her everything immediately. She asked when Elizabeth first realized her feelings. Elizabeth said, \"It happened so gradually I can't pinpoint when it started, but I think it began when I first saw his wonderful home at Pemberley.\" Jane insisted she answer seriously, and Elizabeth reassured her sincerely of her love. Once convinced, Jane was completely satisfied. \"Now I'm happy,\" she said, \"because you'll be as happy as I am. I've always valued him. Even if only for his love for you, I would esteem him; but now, as Bingley's friend and your husband, only Bingley and you are dearer to me. But Lizzy, you've been so secretive! You told me hardly anything about what happened at Pemberley and Lambton—I learned it all from someone else.\" Elizabeth explained she had her reasons: she didn't want to mention Bingley, and wasn't sure of her own feelings, so she avoided mentioning Darcy. Now, she revealed everything, including Darcy's role in Lydia’s marriage, and they spent much of the night talking."

Have not you always hated him?”\nHow earnestly did she then wish that her former opinions had been more reasonable, her expressions more moderate! It would have spared her from explanations and professions which it was exceedingly awkward to give; but they were now necessary, and she assured him, with some confusion, of her attachment to Mr. Darcy.\n“Or, in other words, you are determined to have him. He is rich, to be sure, and you may have more fine clothes and fine carriages than Jane. But will they make you happy?”\n“Have you any other objection,” said Elizabeth, “than your belief of my indifference?”\n“None at all. We all know him to be a proud, unpleasant sort of man; but this would be nothing if you really liked him.”\n“I do, I do like him,” she replied, with tears in her eyes; “I love him. Indeed he has no improper pride. He is perfectly amiable. You do not know what he really is; then pray do not pain me by speaking of him in such terms.”\n“Lizzy,” said her father, “I have given him my consent. He is the kind of man, indeed, to whom I should never dare refuse anything, which he condescended to ask. I now give it to you, if you are resolved on having him. But let me advise you to think better of it. I know your disposition, Lizzy. I know that you could be neither happy nor respectable, unless you truly esteemed your husband, unless you looked up to him as a superior. Your lively talents would place you in the greatest danger in an unequal marriage. You could scarcely escape discredit and misery. My child, let me not have the grief of seeing you unable to respect your partner in life. You know not what you are about.”\nElizabeth, still more affected, was earnest and solemn in her reply; and, at length, by repeated assurances that Mr. Darcy was really the object of her choice, by explaining the gradual change which her estimation of him had undergone, relating her absolute certainty that his affection was not the work of a day, but had stood the test of many months’ suspense, and enumerating with energy all his good qualities, she did conquer her father’s incredulity, and reconcile him to the match.\n“Well, my dear,” said he, when she ceased speaking, “I have no more to say. If this be the case, he deserves you. I could not have parted with you, my Lizzy, to anyone less worthy.”\nTo complete the favourable impression, she then told him what Mr. Darcy had voluntarily done for Lydia. He heard her with astonishment.\n“This is an evening of wonders, indeed! And so, Darcy did everything; made up the match, gave the money, paid the fellow’s debts, and got him his commission! So much the better. It will save me a world of trouble and economy. Had it been your uncle’s doing, I must and would have paid him; but these violent young lovers carry everything their own way. I shall offer to pay him to-morrow, he will rant and storm about his love for you, and there will be an end of the matter.”\nHe then recollected her embarrassment a few days before on his reading Mr. Collins’s letter; and after laughing at her some time, allowed her at last to go, saying, as she quitted the room, “If any young men come for Mary or Kitty, send them in, for I am quite at leisure.”",

It would have saved her the trouble of awkward explanations and declarations. However, they were now necessary, and she hesitantly confirmed her affection for Mr. Darcy. \"In other words,\" he responded, \"you've decided you will have him. He is wealthy, certainly, and you might have finer clothes and carriages than Jane. But will that bring you happiness?\" \"Do you have any objection,\" Elizabeth inquired, \"other than your belief that I am indifferent?\" \"Absolutely none. We all know him to be an arrogant, disagreeable sort of person; but that would be unimportant if you genuinely cared for him.\" \"I do, I truly do like him,\" she answered, her eyes tearing up; \"I love him. Honestly, he is not improperly proud. He is completely pleasant. You don't understand what he is truly like; so please don't distress me by speaking of him in such terms.\" \"Lizzy,\" her father said, \"I have given him my permission. He is indeed the sort of man I would never dare deny anything he deigned to request. I now give you mine, if you are determined to marry him. But let me advise you to reconsider it carefully. I know your nature, Lizzy. I know you could be neither happy nor respectable unless you truly admired your husband, unless you saw him as superior. Your sharp wit would put you in great peril in an unequal marriage. You could barely avoid disgrace and unhappiness. My dear child, let me not suffer the sorrow of seeing you unable to respect your life partner. You do not understand what you are doing.\" Elizabeth, even more moved, was earnest and serious in her response. Finally, by repeatedly assuring him that Mr. Darcy was genuinely the man of her choosing, explaining the gradual change in her opinion of him, stating with absolute certainty that his affection was not a sudden whim but had endured the test of many months of uncertainty, and energetically listing all his good qualities, she managed to overcome her father's disbelief and convince him to accept the marriage. \"Very well, my dear,\" he said when she finished speaking, \"I have nothing further to add. If this is the situation, he is worthy of you. I could not have let you go, my Lizzy, to anyone less deserving.\" To complete the positive impression, she then told him what Mr. Darcy had voluntarily done for Lydia. He listened with astonishment. \"This is truly an evening of surprises! So, Darcy did everything; arranged the marriage, provided the money, paid the fellow's debts, and secured his commission! That's much better. It will save me a great deal of bother and expense. If it had been your uncle's doing, I would have been obliged to pay him back; but these passionate young lovers handle everything their own way. I shall offer to pay him tomorrow, he will rage and complain about his love for you, and that will be the end of the matter.\" He then recalled her discomfort a few days earlier when he was reading Mr. Collins's letter; and after laughing at her for some time, he eventually allowed her to leave, saying as she departed the room, \"If any young men come to see Mary or Kitty, send them in, as I am quite free.\".",

He confronted her, asking what she was thinking by agreeing to marry Mr. Darcy, someone she used to dislike so much. Elizabeth deeply regretted that her past opinions and comments about Darcy had not been more reasonable and moderate, as it now made explaining her change of heart very awkward. Nevertheless, she admitted, a bit embarrassed, that she was attached to Mr. Darcy. Her father remarked that she was set on marrying him—he was rich, and she could have finer things than her sister Jane—but questioned if wealth would make her truly happy. Elizabeth asked if he had any objections beyond believing she was indifferent to Darcy. He replied that although everyone knew Darcy to be proud and disagreeable, that wouldn't matter if Elizabeth truly liked him. Elizabeth, near tears, insisted that she genuinely loved Darcy, describing him as kind and not improperly proud, and begged her father not to speak of him so harshly. Her father then revealed that he'd already given Darcy his consent—he was not the sort of man he could easily refuse—and now gave Elizabeth his blessing too, though he urged her to consider carefully, reminding her she would only be happy in marriage if she respected her husband. He emphasized that her spirited nature might lead to misery in an unbalanced marriage. Elizabeth, even more moved, responded sincerely and convincingly, detailing how her feelings for Darcy had developed and listing his admirable qualities, until her father was convinced and accepted the match. He said he could not have let her marry anyone less deserving. To further reassure her father, Elizabeth explained what Darcy had done for Lydia, which astonished him. He remarked on how remarkable the evening was, noting all that Darcy had done—arranging Lydia's marriage, providing money, paying debts, and securing a commission—and joked that it would spare him much inconvenience. He anticipated offering Darcy repayment, Darcy hotly refusing, and that would be the end of it. He then remembered Elizabeth's earlier embarrassment over Mr. Collins's letter, teased her, and finally let her leave, telling her to send in any suitors for Mary or Kitty because he was now free."

Its effect was most extraordinary; for, on first hearing it, Mrs. Bennet sat quite still, and unable to utter a syllable. Nor was it under many, many minutes, that she could comprehend what she heard, though not in general backward to credit what was for the advantage of her family, or that came in the shape of a lover to any of them. She began at length to recover, to fidget about in her chair, get up, sit down again, wonder, and bless herself.\n“Good gracious! Lord bless me! only think! dear me! Mr. Darcy! Who would have thought it? And is it really true? Oh, my sweetest Lizzy! how rich and how great you will be! What pin-money, what jewels, what carriages you will have!

Be honest now, did you admire me for being impudent?'\n\n'I did,' he said, 'for the vitality of your mind.'\n\n'You might as well just call it impudence,' Elizabeth retorted. 'It was almost exactly that. The truth is, you were tired of politeness, excessive respect, and fawning attention. You were disgusted by women who constantly spoke, looked, and thought only to please you. I drew you in and interested you precisely because I was so unlike them. If you hadn't been genuinely good-hearted, you would have hated me for it. But despite your attempts to hide it, your feelings were always honourable and fair, and in your heart, you utterly disdained those who courted you so eagerly. There—I've saved you the trouble of explaining. And honestly, considering everything, I'm starting to think it's perfectly logical. Of course, you don't know any actual good about me—but nobody considers that when they fall in love.'\n\n'Wasn't your affectionate care for Jane while she was ill at Netherfield a good quality?' Darcy countered.\n\n'Dearest Jane!' Elizabeth exclaimed. 'Anyone would have done as much for her. But please, make a virtue of it by all means. My good qualities are under your protection, and you are expected to exaggerate them as much as possible. In return, it falls to me to find every chance to tease and argue with you, and I shall begin immediately by asking what took you so long to finally get to the point? Why were you so reserved with me when you first visited, and later when you dined here? Why, especially during that first call, did you look like you didn't care about me at all?'\n\n'Because you were serious and quiet, and offered me no encouragement,' he explained.\n\n'But I was just nervous,' Elizabeth said.\n\n'And so was I,' he replied.\n\n'You could have talked to me more when you came for dinner,' she pressed.\n\n'Someone with less intense feelings might have,' Darcy concluded.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "Elizabeth quickly regained her playful mood and asked Mr. Darcy to explain how he had first fallen in love with her. She said, \"How did it all begin? I can see how you might continue liking me once you started, but what started it all?\" Darcy responded that he couldn't pinpoint the exact moment or reason he began to love her; it happened so gradually that he was already in the midst of it before he realized. Elizabeth remarked that he had resisted her looks from the start, and her manners towards him were anything but polite—she often spoke to him with the intention of provoking him. She asked whether her rudeness was what he admired. Darcy replied that it was her lively mind that attracted him. Elizabeth insisted he may as well have called it impertinence because it was hardly different. She suggested that he must have grown tired of the constant politeness and flattery from other women and found her refreshing because she was so different. She teased that if he hadn't been truly good-natured, he would have disliked her for it, but even though he tried to hide it, his feelings were always honorable, and he secretly had little respect for those who tried so hard to please him. By saying this, Elizabeth claimed she had already explained his feelings and thought it all made perfect sense—after all, no one lists a person's virtues as a reason for falling in love. Darcy asked if her caring actions toward Jane at Netherfield didn't count as a good quality. Elizabeth replied that she only did what anyone would have done for Jane and encouraged Darcy to exaggerate her virtues while she, in turn, would continue to tease and quarrel with him. She began at once by questioning why he had been so hesitant to declare his feelings, why he had seemed indifferent on his first visit and at dinner. Darcy explained that she seemed so serious and unwelcoming that he had no encouragement. Elizabeth said that she was actually embarrassed, and Darcy confessed he felt the same. She suggested that he could have engaged her in conversation during dinner, but Darcy replied that a less affected man might have been able to."

Mrs. Philips's lack of refinement required even more patience from him; although both she and her sister were too intimidated by him to address him as openly as Bingley, whenever Mrs. Philips did speak, it was always in a coarse manner. Her respect only made her quieter, not more sophisticated. Elizabeth did her best to protect him from too much interaction with either woman, hoping to keep him among relatives with whom he could converse comfortably. Though these awkward social encounters diminished the enjoyment of their courtship, they made Elizabeth more hopeful for the future, eagerly anticipating the time when they would be away from such company and enjoying the charm and comfort of their home at Pemberley."

Georgiana had always felt such respect for Darcy that it nearly overshadowed her feelings of affection for him, so witnessing him being playfully teased was a new experience. Through Elizabeth's example, Georgiana learned things she never had before.
