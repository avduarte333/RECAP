          "text_segment": "Marley was dead: to begin with. There is no doubt whatever about that. The register of his burial was signed by the clergyman, the clerk, the undertaker, and the chief mourner. Scrooge signed it: and Scrooge’s name was good upon ’Change, for anything he chose to put his hand to. Old Marley was as dead as a door-nail.\nMind! I don’t mean to say that I know, of my own knowledge, what there is particularly dead about a door-nail. I might have been inclined, myself, to regard a coffin-nail as the deadest piece of ironmongery in the trade. But the wisdom of our ancestors is in the simile; and my unhallowed hands shall not disturb it, or the Country’s done for. You will therefore permit me to repeat, emphatically, that Marley was as dead as a door-nail.\nScrooge knew he was dead? Of course he did. How could it be otherwise? Scrooge and he were partners for I don’t know how many years. Scrooge was his sole executor, his sole administrator, his sole assign, his sole residuary legatee, his sole friend, and sole mourner. And even Scrooge was not so dreadfully cut up by the sad event, but that he was an excellent man of business on the very day of the funeral, and solemnised it with an undoubted bargain.\nThe mention of Marley’s funeral brings me back to the point I started from. There is no doubt that Marley was dead. This must be distinctly understood, or nothing wonderful can come of the story I am going to relate. If we were not perfectly convinced that Hamlet’s Father died before the play began, there would be nothing more remarkable in his taking a stroll at night, in an easterly wind, upon his own ramparts, than there would be in any other middle-aged gentleman rashly turning out after dark in a breezy spot—say Saint Paul’s Churchyard for instance—literally to astonish his son’s weak mind.\nScrooge never painted out Old Marley’s name. There it stood, years afterwards, above the warehouse door: Scrooge and Marley. The firm was known as Scrooge and Marley. Sometimes people new to the business called Scrooge Scrooge, and sometimes Marley, but he answered to both names. It was all the same to him.\nOh! But he was a tight-fisted hand at the grindstone, Scrooge! a squeezing, wrenching, grasping, scraping, clutching, covetous, old sinner! Hard and sharp as flint, from which no steel had ever struck out generous fire; secret, and self-contained, and solitary as an oyster. The cold within him froze his old features, nipped his pointed nose, shrivelled his cheek, stiffened his gait; made his eyes red, his thin lips blue; and spoke out shrewdly in his grating voice. A frosty rime was on his head, and on his eyebrows, and his wiry chin. He carried his own low temperature always about with him; he iced his office in the dog-days; and didn’t thaw it one degree at Christmas.\nExternal heat and cold had little influence on Scrooge. No warmth could warm, no wintry weather chill him. No wind that blew was bitterer than he, no falling snow was more intent upon its purpose, no pelting rain less open to entreaty. Foul weather didn’t know where to have him. The heaviest rain, and snow, and hail, and sleet, could boast of the advantage over him in only one respect. They often “came down” handsomely, and Scrooge never did.\nNobody ever stopped him in the street to say, with gladsome looks, “My dear Scrooge, how are you? When will you come to see me?” No beggars implored him to bestow a trifle, no children asked him what it was o’clock, no man or woman ever once in all his life inquired the way to such and such a place, of Scrooge. Even the blind men’s dogs appeared to know him; and when they saw him coming on, would tug their owners into doorways and up courts; and then would wag their tails as though they said, “No eye at all is better than an evil eye, dark master!”",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "Let's start by establishing that Marley was undeniably dead. There's absolutely no question about it. The official record of his burial was signed by several people, including the clergyman, clerk, undertaker, and the person designated as the chief mourner, which was Scrooge. Scrooge's signature was highly respected in the business world, carrying weight on the 'Change for anything he endorsed. Old Marley was as profoundly dead as a door-nail. Now, I must confess, I'm not entirely sure why a door-nail is considered particularly dead. If you asked me, a coffin-nail might seem like the most lifeless piece of metal you could find. But this is a well-established saying from our ancestors, and I dare not tamper with it, lest I cause chaos. So, allow me to reiterate, forcefully, that Marley was indeed as dead as a door-nail. Did Scrooge know about his death? Of course he did. How could he not? Scrooge and Marley had been business partners for many years. Scrooge was left everything—his sole executor, administrator, heir, recipient of leftover assets, his only friend, and the only person who officially grieved him. Yet, even Scrooge wasn't so overcome with grief by the sad event that it interfered with his business acumen; he was sharp and successful on the very day of the funeral, even sealing a profitable deal. The mention of Marley's funeral brings me back to the critical point: there is no doubt whatsoever that Marley was dead. This fact must be completely accepted and understood, or the remarkable events I'm about to describe won't make sense. If we weren't absolutely certain that Hamlet's father was dead before that play started, his walking around at night on the castle walls in a cold east wind would be no more unusual than any other middle-aged gentleman foolishly venturing out after dark in a drafty place—like, say, Saint Paul's Churchyard—just to startle his easily shocked son. Scrooge never bothered to remove Old Marley's name. Years later, it was still painted above the door of the warehouse: Scrooge and Marley. The company was universally known as Scrooge and Marley. Occasionally, newcomers to the business would address Scrooge as either 'Scrooge' or 'Marley', but he responded to both. It didn't matter to him. Ah, but Scrooge was an incredibly stingy man when it came to work! He was a tight-fisted, greedy, demanding, scraping, hoarding, covetous old wretch! He was as hard and unyielding as flint, from which no spark of generosity could ever be struck; secretive, withdrawn, and isolated like an oyster. The coldness inside him seemed to freeze his aging face, pinching his pointed nose, making his cheek hollow, stiffening his walk; it made his eyes bloodshot, his thin lips blue, and his harsh voice grating and shrewd. A frosty white coating seemed to rest on his head, his eyebrows, and his stiff beard. He constantly radiated his own low temperature; he kept his office freezing even in the height of summer and didn't let it warm up at all for Christmas. External heat and cold had almost no impact on Scrooge. No amount of warmth could thaw him, and no wintry weather could make him any colder. No wind was sharper than he was, no falling snow was more focused on its purpose, and no driving rain was less open to any plea. Foul weather simply couldn't affect him. The heaviest rain, snow, hail, and sleet only had one advantage over him: they often 'came down' generously, while Scrooge never did. No one ever stopped him in the street to say, with a cheerful look, 'Hello, my dear Scrooge, how are you? When can you come visit?' No poor person ever begged him for a small donation, no children ever asked him the time, no man or woman in his entire life ever asked Scrooge for directions to a place. Even dogs belonging to blind people seemed to recognize him; when they saw him approaching, they would pull their owners quickly into doorways or up alleys, and then wag their tails as if saying, 'It's better to have no sight at all than to endure an evil eye, dark master!'",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "To start, Marley was definitely dead. There was no question about it, as his burial was officially documented and signed by all the appropriate people, including Scrooge, whose signature was trusted in business. Marley was as dead as can be—though, to be honest, I'm not sure why a door-nail is chosen for that comparison, since a coffin-nail might seem even deader. But traditional sayings are best left as they are, so let me repeat: Marley was dead as a door-nail. \n\nDid Scrooge know Marley was dead? Absolutely. They had been business partners for many years, and Scrooge was Marley's only executor, heir, and friend. Scrooge didn't seem particularly distressed by Marley's death, and he was conducting business on the very day of the funeral, making it a profitable occasion. The whole point of mentioning Marley's funeral is to stress again: Marley was dead. This fact is essential to accept, otherwise nothing extraordinary in the story that follows would make any sense. Just as in Hamlet, if we weren't sure Hamlet's father had died before the play began, his ghostly appearance wouldn't seem remarkable at all.\n\nScrooge never removed Marley’s name from the warehouse sign. Even years later, it still read \"Scrooge and Marley.\" Their business was known by that name, and newcomers sometimes called Scrooge by either name—he didn’t care; he answered to both.\n\nScrooge himself was a miserly, grasping old man—tight-fisted and hard-hearted, as unyielding as flint and as secretive and solitary as an oyster. His miserly nature seemed to seep into his appearance: it made his features cold, his nose pinched, his cheeks sunken, and gave him a frosty demeanour. He brought this chill with him everywhere, even keeping his office cold in summer and never warming it at Christmas.\n\nNo external warmth or cold seemed to affect him. No weather was harsher than he was; the worst storms had nothing on his lack of sympathy. Storms at least could be generous in their severity—Scrooge never was.\n\nPeople avoided him. No one greeted Scrooge on the street, no beggars asked him for charity, no children wanted to talk to him, and no one asked him for directions. Even blind men’s dogs seemed to recognize him and would drag their owners away to avoid crossing paths, wagging their tails as if grateful to be spared from encountering such a person."

          "text_segment": "But what did Scrooge care! It was the very thing he liked. To edge his way along the crowded paths of life, warning all human sympathy to keep its distance, was what the knowing ones call “nuts” to Scrooge.\nOnce upon a time—of all the good days in the year, on Christmas Eve—old Scrooge sat busy in his counting-house. It was cold, bleak, biting weather: foggy withal: and he could hear the people in the court outside, go wheezing up and down, beating their hands upon their breasts, and stamping their feet upon the pavement stones to warm them. The city clocks had only just gone three, but it was quite dark already—it had not been light all day—and candles were flaring in the windows of the neighbouring offices, like ruddy smears upon the palpable brown air. The fog came pouring in at every chink and keyhole, and was so dense without, that although the court was of the narrowest, the houses opposite were mere phantoms. To see the dingy cloud come drooping down, obscuring everything, one might have thought that Nature lived hard by, and was brewing on a large scale.\nThe door of Scrooge’s counting-house was open that he might keep his eye upon his clerk, who in a dismal little cell beyond, a sort of tank, was copying letters. Scrooge had a very small fire, but the clerk’s fire was so very much smaller that it looked like one coal. But he couldn’t replenish it, for Scrooge kept the coal-box in his own room; and so surely as the clerk came in with the shovel, the master predicted that it would be necessary for them to part. Wherefore the clerk put on his white comforter, and tried to warm himself at the candle; in which effort, not being a man of a strong imagination, he failed.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "But Scrooge didn't mind at all; in fact, he found it quite agreeable. To navigate through life's crowded streets, actively pushing away any possibility of connection with others, was something the well-informed considered genuinely satisfying for Scrooge. It happened on Christmas Eve, the most significant day of the year, that old Scrooge was busy working in his office. The weather was harsh, freezing, and biting, and thick with fog. He could hear people in the alley outside struggling to breathe as they walked, slapping their hands together on their chests and stomping their feet on the stone ground to generate warmth. It had just turned three according to the city clocks, but it was already completely dark – the day had never really brightened – and candles flickered in the windows of nearby offices, appearing like hazy, reddish smears against the thick, visible brown air. The fog seeped in through every crack and keyhole, and outside it was so dense that even though the alley was very narrow, the buildings across the way looked like mere outlines. Watching the dark, heavy cloud descend and cover everything, one might have thought that Nature itself was close by, energetically brewing up this atmosphere on a massive scale. Scrooge had left the door of his office open so he could keep an eye on his clerk, who was in a miserable little area beyond, like a cramped container, copying documents. Scrooge had a very small fire, but the clerk's fire was significantly smaller, resembling just a single lump of coal. However, he couldn't add more fuel, as Scrooge kept the coal supply locked in his own room; and whenever the clerk approached with the shovel, his employer would instantly threaten dismissal. Consequently, the clerk wrapped his white scarf around his neck and tried to warm himself using the candle flame; an attempt that failed because he lacked a strong enough imagination to make it work.",

Even though it was only three in the afternoon, it was already very dark—daylight had never really arrived—and candles in nearby offices threw dull red glows into the heavy brown fog. The mist seeped through every gap and crack, making the already narrow street look shadowy and ghost-like. It seemed almost as if Nature herself lived nearby and was brewing a thick fog on a grand scale. Scrooge kept the door to his office open so he could keep watch on his clerk, who worked in a tiny, depressing room beyond, copying letters. Scrooge’s own fire was quite small, but the clerk’s was so minuscule it could barely be called a fire at all. Scrooge kept strict control of the coal supply, so whenever the clerk tried to get more, Scrooge would threaten to dismiss him. Forced to endure the cold, the clerk put on his white scarf and attempted to warm himself with the candle flame, which, lacking much imagination, was a futile effort."

          "text_segment": "“A merry Christmas, uncle! God save you!” cried a cheerful voice. It was the voice of Scrooge’s nephew, who came upon him so quickly that this was the first intimation he had of his approach.\n“Bah!” said Scrooge, “Humbug!”\nHe had so heated himself with rapid walking in the fog and frost, this nephew of Scrooge’s, that he was all in a glow; his face was ruddy and handsome; his eyes sparkled, and his breath smoked again.\n“Christmas a humbug, uncle!” said Scrooge’s nephew. “You don’t mean that, I am sure?”\n“I do,” said Scrooge. “Merry Christmas! What right have you to be merry? What reason have you to be merry? You’re poor enough.”\n“Come, then,” returned the nephew gaily. “What right have you to be dismal? What reason have you to be morose? You’re rich enough.”\nScrooge having no better answer ready on the spur of the moment, said, “Bah!” again; and followed it up with “Humbug.”\n“Don’t be cross, uncle!” said the nephew.\n“What else can I be,” returned the uncle, “when I live in such a world of fools as this? Merry Christmas! Out upon merry Christmas! What’s Christmas time to you but a time for paying bills without money; a time for finding yourself a year older, but not an hour richer; a time for balancing your books and having every item in ’em through a round dozen of months presented dead against you? If I could work my will,” said Scrooge indignantly, “every idiot who goes about with ‘Merry Christmas’ on his lips, should be boiled with his own pudding, and buried with a stake of holly through his heart. He should!”\n“Uncle!” pleaded the nephew.\n“Nephew!” returned the uncle sternly, “keep Christmas in your own way, and let me keep it in mine.”\n“Keep it!” repeated Scrooge’s nephew. “But you don’t keep it.”\n“Let me leave it alone, then,” said Scrooge. “Much good may it do you! Much good it has ever done you!”\n“There are many things from which I might have derived good, by which I have not profited, I dare say,” returned the nephew. “Christmas among the rest. But I am sure I have always thought of Christmas time, when it has come round—apart from the veneration due to its sacred name and origin, if anything belonging to it can be apart from that—as a good time; a kind, forgiving, charitable, pleasant time; the only time I know of, in the long calendar of the year, when men and women seem by one consent to open their shut-up hearts freely, and to think of people below them as if they really were fellow-passengers to the grave, and not another race of creatures bound on other journeys. And therefore, uncle, though it has never put a scrap of gold or silver in my pocket, I believe that it has done me good, and will do me good; and I say, God bless it!”\nThe clerk in the Tank involuntarily applauded. Becoming immediately sensible of the impropriety, he poked the fire, and extinguished the last frail spark for ever.\n“Let me hear another sound from you,” said Scrooge, “and you’ll keep your Christmas by losing your situation! You’re quite a powerful speaker, sir,” he added, turning to his nephew. “I wonder you don’t go into Parliament.”\n“Don’t be angry, uncle. Come! Dine with us to-morrow.”\nScrooge said that he would see him—yes, indeed he did. He went the whole length of the expression, and said that he would see him in that extremity first.\n“But why?” cried Scrooge’s nephew. “Why?”\n“Why did you get married?” said Scrooge.\n“Because I fell in love.”\n“Because you fell in love!” growled Scrooge, as if that were the only one thing in the world more ridiculous than a merry Christmas. “Good afternoon!”\n“Nay, uncle, but you never came to see me before that happened. Why give it as a reason for not coming now?”\n“Good afternoon,” said Scrooge.\n“I want nothing from you; I ask nothing of you; why cannot we be friends?”\n“Good afternoon,” said Scrooge.\n“I am sorry, with all my heart, to find you so resolute. We have never had any quarrel, to which I have been a party. But I have made the trial in homage to Christmas, and I’ll keep my Christmas humour to the last. So A Merry Christmas, uncle!”\n“Good afternoon!” said Scrooge.\n“And A Happy New Year!”\n“Good afternoon!” said Scrooge.\nHis nephew left the room without an angry word, notwithstanding. He stopped at the outer door to bestow the greetings of the season on the clerk, who, cold as he was, was warmer than Scrooge; for he returned them cordially.\n“There’s another fellow,” muttered Scrooge; who overheard him: “my clerk, with fifteen shillings a week, and a wife and family, talking about a merry Christmas. I’ll retire to Bedlam.”\nThis lunatic, in letting Scrooge’s nephew out, had let two other people in. They were portly gentlemen, pleasant to behold, and now stood, with their hats off, in Scrooge’s office. They had books and papers in their hands, and bowed to him.\n“Scrooge and Marley’s, I believe,” said one of the gentlemen, referring to his list. “Have I the pleasure of addressing Mr. Scrooge, or Mr. Marley?”\n“Mr. Marley has been dead these seven years,” Scrooge replied. “He died seven years ago, this very night.”\n“We have no doubt his liberality is well represented by his surviving partner,” said the gentleman, presenting his credentials.\nIt certainly was; for they had been two kindred spirits. At the ominous word “liberality,” Scrooge frowned, and shook his head, and handed the credentials back.\n“At this festive season of the year, Mr. Scrooge,” said the gentleman, taking up a pen, “it is more than usually desirable that we should make some slight provision for the Poor and destitute, who suffer greatly at the present time. Many thousands are in want of common necessaries; hundreds of thousands are in want of common comforts, sir.”\n“Are there no prisons?” asked Scrooge.\n“Plenty of prisons,” said the gentleman, laying down the pen again.\n“And the Union workhouses?” demanded Scrooge. “Are they still in operation?”\n“They are. Still,” returned the gentleman, “I wish I could say they were not.”\n“The Treadmill and the Poor Law are in full vigour, then?” said Scrooge.\n“Both very busy, sir.”\n“Oh! I was afraid, from what you said at first, that something had occurred to stop them in their useful course,” said Scrooge. “I’m very glad to hear it.”\n“Under the impression that they scarcely furnish Christian cheer of mind or body to the multitude,” returned the gentleman, “a few of us are endeavouring to raise a fund to buy the Poor some meat and drink, and means of warmth. We choose this time, because it is a time, of all others, when Want is keenly felt, and Abundance rejoices. What shall I put you down for?”\n“Nothing!” Scrooge replied.\n“You wish to be anonymous?”\n“I wish to be left alone,” said Scrooge. “Since you ask me what I wish, gentlemen, that is my answer. I don’t make merry myself at Christmas and I can’t afford to make idle people merry. I help to support the establishments I have mentioned—they cost enough; and those who are badly off must go there.”\n“Many can’t go there; and many would rather die.”\n“If they would rather die,” said Scrooge, “they had better do it, and decrease the surplus population. Besides—excuse me—I don’t know that.”\n“But you might know it,” observed the gentleman.\n“It’s not my business,” Scrooge returned. “It’s enough for a man to understand his own business, and not to interfere with other people’s. Mine occupies me constantly. Good afternoon, gentlemen!”\nSeeing clearly that it would be useless to pursue their point, the gentlemen withdrew. Scrooge resumed his labours with an improved opinion of himself, and in a more facetious temper than was usual with him.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "A cheerful voice called out, \"Happy Christmas, uncle! God bless you!\" It belonged to Scrooge's nephew, who had approached so quickly that Scrooge was unaware of his presence until he spoke. \"Ridiculous!\" scoffed Scrooge, \"Nonsense!\" Scrooge's nephew was radiating warmth from his brisk walk through the cold, foggy air; his face was flushed and pleasant, his eyes sparkled, and his breath created puffs of mist. \"Christmas is nonsense, uncle?\" asked Scrooge's nephew. \"Surely you don't genuinely mean that?\" \"I do,\" Scrooge replied. \"Happy Christmas! What gives you the right to be happy? What reason do you have? You're practically broke.\" \"Well then,\" the nephew responded good-naturedly. \"What gives you the right to be gloomy? What reason to be miserable? You're quite wealthy.\" With no immediate, better response, Scrooge simply repeated, \"Ridiculous!\" adding, \"Nonsense.\" \"Don't be irritable, uncle!\" the nephew urged. \"How else can I be,\" his uncle retorted, \"when I live in such a world of fools? Happy Christmas! Away with happy Christmas! What is Christmas for you but a time to settle debts without money; a time to realize you're a year older, but not a bit richer; a time to go over your accounts and find every single item from the past year counting against you? If I could do as I please,\" Scrooge declared angrily, \"any simpleton who goes around saying 'Happy Christmas' should be boiled along with their own pudding and buried with a holly branch stuck through their heart! Absolutely!\" \"Uncle!\" his nephew pleaded. \"Nephew!\" his uncle replied sternly, \"Celebrate Christmas as you see fit, and let me disregard it as I see fit.\" \"Disregard it!\" Scrooge's nephew repeated. \"But you don't celebrate it at all.\" \"Then let me have nothing to do with it,\" Scrooge said. \"May it do you a great deal of good! Much good it has ever done you!\" \"I admit there are many things that might have benefited me, yet from which I gained nothing,\" the nephew replied. \"Christmas is among them. But I am sure I have always considered Christmas time, when it arrives—setting aside the respect due to its sacred name and origins, if anything about it can be separated from that—as a positive period; a kind, forgiving, generous, and pleasant time; the only time I know of throughout the year when people collectively seem to open their closed hearts willingly and regard those less fortunate as if they were truly fellow travelers towards death, not some other species destined for different journeys. And therefore, uncle, although it has never put any gold or silver in my pocket, I believe it *has* been good for me, and *will* continue to be good for me; and I say, God bless it!\" The clerk in his section instinctively clapped. Immediately realizing how improper that was, he poked the fire, completely extinguishing the last faint spark. \"Let me hear one more sound from *you*,\" Scrooge warned, \"and you'll celebrate your Christmas by losing your job! You're quite the orator, sir,\" he added, turning to his nephew. \"I'm surprised you haven't pursued a political career.\" \"Don't be upset, uncle. Please! Have dinner with us tomorrow.\" Scrooge said that he would see him... indeed he did. He used the most extreme form of refusal possible, saying he would see him facing the utmost difficulty first. \"But why?\" cried Scrooge's nephew. \"Why?\" \"Why did you get married?\" Scrooge asked. \"Because I fell in love.\" \"Because you fell in love!\" Scrooge grumbled, as though that were the only thing in the world more foolish than a happy Christmas. \"Good afternoon!\" \"But uncle, you never came to see me before that happened. Why use it as a reason not to come now?\" \"Good afternoon,\" said Scrooge. \"I don't want anything from you; I'm not asking for anything from you; why can't we just be friends?\" \"Good afternoon,\" said Scrooge. \"I am sincerely sorry to find you so determined. We have never had an argument that I was involved in. But I made this effort out of respect for Christmas, and I shall maintain my Christmas spirit throughout. So, A Happy Christmas, uncle!\" \"Good afternoon!\" said Scrooge. \"And A Prosperous New Year!\" \"Good afternoon!\" said Scrooge. Nevertheless, his nephew left the room without expressing anger. He paused at the outside door to extend season's greetings to the clerk, who, despite the cold, was more amiable than Scrooge; he returned the wishes warmly. \"There's another one,\" Scrooge muttered, overhearing him; \"my clerk, on fifteen shillings a week, with a wife and children, talking about a happy Christmas. I'll end up in a lunatic asylum.\" As this eccentric person (Scrooge's nephew) departed, he allowed two other individuals to enter. They were stout gentlemen, pleasant to look upon, and now stood, having removed their hats, in Scrooge's office. They carried books and papers and bowed to him. \"Scrooge and Marley's, I presume,\" one of the gentlemen said, checking his list. \"Do I have the pleasure of speaking with Mr. Scrooge, or Mr. Marley?\" \"Mr. Marley passed away seven years ago,\" Scrooge replied. \"He died exactly seven years ago tonight.\" \"We are confident his generosity is well represented by his surviving associate,\" said the gentleman, presenting their credentials. This was indeed true, as they had been two similar spirits. At the inauspicious word \"generosity,\" Scrooge scowled, shook his head, and handed the credentials back. \"At this celebratory period of the year, Mr. Scrooge,\" the gentleman continued, picking up a pen, \"it is particularly important that we arrange some small aid for the Poor and needy, who are suffering greatly at this time. Many thousands are without basic necessities; hundreds of thousands, sir, lack simple comforts.\" \"Are there no jails?\" Scrooge inquired. \"Plenty of jails,\" said the gentleman, setting the pen down again. \"And the public workhouses?\" Scrooge demanded. \"Are they still operating?\" \"They are. Still,\" the gentleman replied, \"I wish I could say they were not.\" \"The Treadmill and the Poor Law are in full effect, then?\" Scrooge asked. \"Both extremely busy, sir.\" \"Oh! I was concerned, based on your initial remarks, that something had occurred to disrupt their beneficial operation,\" said Scrooge. \"I'm very pleased to hear they are active.\" \"Under the impression that they provide little in the way of Christian comfort for mind or body to the majority,\" the gentleman explained, \"a few of us are trying to raise money to purchase the Poor some food, drink, and warmth. We choose this season because it is a time, more than any other, when poverty is acutely felt, and abundance is celebrated. How much should I record you for?\" \"Nothing!\" Scrooge replied. \"You wish to remain anonymous?\" \"I wish to be left alone,\" said Scrooge. \"Since you are asking what I desire, gentlemen, that is my answer. I do not celebrate Christmas myself, and I cannot afford to enable idle individuals to be merry. I contribute to the support of the institutions I mentioned—they are expensive enough; and those who are in need should go there.\" \"Many are unable to go there; and many would prefer death.\" \"If they prefer to die,\" said Scrooge, \"they had better do so and reduce the surplus population. Besides—excuse me—I am not aware of that.\" \"But you could inform yourself,\" the gentleman noted. \"It is not my concern,\" Scrooge retorted. \"It is sufficient for a person to manage their own business and not interfere with others'. Mine keeps me fully occupied. Good afternoon, gentlemen!\" Recognizing clearly that it would be fruitless to continue their discussion, the gentlemen departed. Scrooge returned to his tasks feeling more satisfied with himself and in a slightly more amiable mood than usual.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "\"Merry Christmas, uncle! God bless you!\" came an enthusiastic greeting—it was Scrooge’s nephew, who appeared so suddenly that Scrooge had no warning of his arrival. \n\n\"Bah!\" grumbled Scrooge, \"Nonsense!\"\n\nThe nephew, flushed and glowing from walking briskly through the cold and damp, looked hearty and cheerful, with sparkling eyes and breath steaming in the chilly air.\n\n\"You can't seriously think Christmas is nonsense, uncle!\" Scrooge’s nephew protested. \"You don't really mean that, do you?\"\n\n\"I do,\" said Scrooge. \"Merry Christmas! What right have you to be merry? Why are you merry? You don't have any money.\"\n\n\"Well,\" his nephew replied cheerfully, \"what right have you to be miserable? Why are you so gloomy? You’re certainly rich enough.\"\n\nSince Scrooge couldn't come up with a better reply immediately, he just repeated, \"Bah!\" followed by \"Humbug.\"\n\n\"Please don’t be irritable, uncle,\" said the nephew.\n\n\"And why shouldn’t I be?\" Scrooge shot back. \"I live in a world full of fools! Merry Christmas! Bah! What does Christmas mean to you except having to pay bills without the money to do so; realizing you’re a year older and not a penny richer; and reviewing your finances only to see a year’s worth of losses staring at you? If I had my way,\" Scrooge declared hotly, \"every idiot who goes about shouting ‘Merry Christmas’ should be boiled in his own pudding and buried with a holly stake through his heart. Absolutely guaranteed!\"\n\n\"Uncle!\" pleaded the nephew.\n\n\"Nephew!\" replied Scrooge sternly, \"celebrate Christmas as you wish, and let me celebrate it as I wish.\"\n\n\"But you don’t celebrate it at all!\" pointed out the nephew.\n\n\"Then let me ignore it in peace,\" said Scrooge. \"Much good may it do you! It’s never done you any good!\"\n\n\"There are lots of things from which I could have benefitted, even if I haven’t made any money from them,\" his nephew said. \"Christmas included. But I’ve always thought that Christmas is a wonderful time—a time for kindness, generosity, forgiveness, and a pleasant spirit; the only time in the whole year when people seem to open up their hearts freely, and see everyone as equals on the journey of life. That’s why, even if Christmas has never made me rich, I know it’s been good for me and will continue to be; so I say, God bless Christmas!\"\n\nHearing this, Scrooge’s clerk involuntarily clapped his hands. Instantaneously aware it was inappropriate, he turned to the fire and tended it, putting out the last weak ember forever.\n\n\"One more word from you,\" Scrooge warned the clerk, \"and you’ll find yourself celebrating Christmas without a job! You make quite the speech-maker,\" Scrooge added to his nephew. \"You ought to be in Parliament.\"\n\n\"Don’t be angry, uncle. Come, have dinner with us tomorrow.\"\n\nScrooge flatly refused, saying in no uncertain terms that he would rather see his nephew in the farthest extremity first.\n\n\"But why?\" his nephew insisted. \"Why?\"\n\n\"Why did you get married?\" Scrooge countered.\n\n\"Because I fell in love.\"\n\n\"Because you fell in love!\" Scrooge scoffed, as if it was the single most ridiculous thing next to Christmas cheer. \"Good afternoon!\"\n\n\"Uncle, you stopped visiting before I ever got married. Why blame my marriage for not visiting now?\"\n\n\"Good afternoon,\" said Scrooge.\n\n\"I want nothing from you. I ask for nothing. Why can’t we be friends?\"\n\n\"Good afternoon,\" said Scrooge.\n\n\"I’m truly sorry to find you so unmoved. We’ve never had a fight, at least not from my side. I tried for Christmas’s sake, and I will always keep my Christmas spirit alive. So, Merry Christmas, uncle!\"\n\n\"Good afternoon!\" replied Scrooge.\n\n\"And a happy New Year!\"\n\n\"Good afternoon!\" said Scrooge.\n\nDespite this cold treatment, his nephew left without a harsh word. On his way out, he cheerfully wished the clerk a happy Christmas, who, though freezing, gave a warm response—warmer than Scrooge’s.\n\n\"Another one,\" muttered Scrooge, overhearing, \"my clerk, scraping by on fifteen shillings a week, supporting a wife and family, talking about a merry Christmas. I might as well go to the madhouse.\"\n\nAs the clerk let the nephew out, two well-dressed gentlemen came in. They held papers and notebooks, hats doffed, and bowed politely.\n\n\"Scrooge and Marley’s, isn’t it?\" asked one, checking his list. \"May I address Mr. Scrooge or Mr. Marley?\"\n\n\"Mr. Marley has been dead seven years,\" said Scrooge. \"He died exactly seven years ago, tonight.\"\n\n\"We doubt not that his generous spirit is alive in his partner,\" said the gentleman, handing Scrooge his credentials.\n\nIt was true; after all, the two had been similar in their ways. At the mention of \"generosity,\" Scrooge frowned, shook his head, and handed the papers back.\n\n\"At this special time of year, Mr. Scrooge,\" said the first gentleman, picking up his pen, \"it’s especially important that we provide a little help for the poor and needy, who suffer so much these days. Thousands need basic necessities, hundreds of thousands lack comfort.\"\n\n\"Aren’t there prisons?\" Scrooge asked.\n\n\"There are plenty of prisons,\" replied the gentleman, setting down his pen.\n\n\"And union workhouses—are they still running?\" demanded Scrooge.\n\n\"They are—though I wish I could say they weren’t,\" came the answer.\n\n\"And the treadmill and Poor Law—they’re still in effect?\"\n\n\"Very busy, sir.\"\n\n\"Oh! I was worried by what you said, thinking something had stopped them,\" Scrooge said. \"I’m relieved to hear it.\"\n\n\"The institutions you mention hardly bring comfort or hope to those in need,\" said the gentleman. \"So we are trying to raise money to buy them food and warmth. We do it now, because Christmas is when those without most feel their need, and those with plenty should share their joy. What can I put your name down for?\"\n\n\"Nothing,\" Scrooge replied.\n\n\"You want your donation kept anonymous?\"\n\n\"I want to be left alone,\" Scrooge said curtly. \"You asked what I want. That’s it. I don’t celebrate Christmas, and I can’t afford to help people who don’t work. I give my tax money to support the institutions I mentioned—they’re expensive enough. Anyone who’s struggling should go there.\"\n\n\"Many can’t, and many would rather die.\"\n\n\"If they’d rather die,\" said Scrooge, \"then let them. That will reduce the surplus population. Besides—I have no way of knowing that.\"\n\n\"But you might know it,\" the gentleman suggested.\n\n\"It’s not my business,\" replied Scrooge. \"Each person should mind their own affairs and not meddle. I have enough with my own. Good afternoon, gentlemen.\"\n\nRealizing further argument was pointless, the two men left. Scrooge, meanwhile, felt quite pleased with himself for his stance, and was ironically in better spirits than usual."

          "text_segment": "Meanwhile the fog and darkness thickened so, that people ran about with flaring links, proffering their services to go before horses in carriages, and conduct them on their way. The ancient tower of a church, whose gruff old bell was always peeping slily down at Scrooge out of a Gothic window in the wall, became invisible, and struck the hours and quarters in the clouds, with tremulous vibrations afterwards as if its teeth were chattering in its frozen head up there. The cold became intense. In the main street, at the corner of the court, some labourers were repairing the gas-pipes, and had lighted a great fire in a brazier, round which a party of ragged men and boys were gathered: warming their hands and winking their eyes before the blaze in rapture. The water-plug being left in solitude, its overflowings sullenly congealed, and turned to misanthropic ice. The brightness of the shops where holly sprigs and berries crackled in the lamp heat of the windows, made pale faces ruddy as they passed. Poulterers’ and grocers’ trades became a splendid joke: a glorious pageant, with which it was next to impossible to believe that such dull principles as bargain and sale had anything to do. The Lord Mayor, in the stronghold of the mighty Mansion House, gave orders to his fifty cooks and butlers to keep Christmas as a Lord Mayor’s household should; and even the little tailor, whom he had fined five shillings on the previous Monday for being drunk and bloodthirsty in the streets, stirred up to-morrow’s pudding in his garret, while his lean wife and the baby sallied out to buy the beef.\nFoggier yet, and colder. Piercing, searching, biting cold. If the good Saint Dunstan had but nipped the Evil Spirit’s nose with a touch of such weather as that, instead of using his familiar weapons, then indeed he would have roared to lusty purpose. The owner of one scant young nose, gnawed and mumbled by the hungry cold as bones are gnawed by dogs, stooped down at Scrooge’s keyhole to regale him with a Christmas carol: but at the first sound of\n“God bless you, merry gentleman!\n  May nothing you dismay!”\nScrooge seized the ruler with such energy of action, that the singer fled in terror, leaving the keyhole to the fog and even more congenial frost.\nAt length the hour of shutting up the counting-house arrived. With an ill-will Scrooge dismounted from his stool, and tacitly admitted the fact to the expectant clerk in the Tank, who instantly snuffed his candle out, and put on his hat.\n“You’ll want all day to-morrow, I suppose?” said Scrooge.\n“If quite convenient, sir.”\n“It’s not convenient,” said Scrooge, “and it’s not fair. If I was to stop half-a-crown for it, you’d think yourself ill-used, I’ll be bound?”\nThe clerk smiled faintly.\n“And yet,” said Scrooge, “you don’t think me ill-used, when I pay a day’s wages for no work.”\nThe clerk observed that it was only once a year.\n“A poor excuse for picking a man’s pocket every twenty-fifth of December!” said Scrooge, buttoning his great-coat to the chin. “But I suppose you must have the whole day. Be here all the earlier next morning.”\nThe clerk promised that he would; and Scrooge walked out with a growl. The office was closed in a twinkling, and the clerk, with the long ends of his white comforter dangling below his waist (for he boasted no great-coat), went down a slide on Cornhill, at the end of a lane of boys, twenty times, in honour of its being Christmas Eve, and then ran home to Camden Town as hard as he could pelt, to play at blindman’s-buff.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "The increasing fog and darkness made the air so thick that people carrying torches hurried about, offering to light the way for horse-drawn carriages and pedestrians. The old stone church tower, whose deep-toned bell seemed to constantly peer down at Scrooge from its high, pointed window, became invisible. Its tolls for the hours and quarter hours now sounded from within the unseen mist, followed by wavering echoes, as if the bell itself were shivering with cold high above. The temperature dropped sharply. On the main street, near the entrance to the court, workers were fixing gas pipes and had lit a large fire in a metal container. A group of poorly dressed men and boys huddled around it, warming their hands and blinking happily in the firelight. A lonely water-tap had frozen over where it overflowed, its congealed ice appearing hostile and unyielding. The bright displays in shop windows, where festive holly sprigs and berries crackled from the heat of the lamps, cast a warm glow that made pale faces look flushed as people walked by. The shops selling poultry and groceries seemed transformed into a magnificent, joyful spectacle, a glorious display that made it almost impossible to believe it was simply about the mundane activities of buying and selling. The Lord Mayor, from his grand Mansion House, commanded his numerous cooks and staff to observe Christmas in the manner befitting his official residence; and even the humble tailor, whom the Mayor had fined just the previous Monday for causing trouble while drunk and disorderly, was seen stirring tomorrow's pudding in his small upstairs room, while his frail wife and baby ventured out to buy the meat. The fog grew denser, and the cold became even more severe. It was a bitter, penetrating, biting cold. If the good Saint Dunstan had used this kind of weather to pinch the Evil Spirit's nose, instead of his usual methods, the Devil would certainly have roared with genuine pain. The owner of a very small nose, which was numb and aching from the severe cold like a bone being gnawed by dogs, knelt down at Scrooge's keyhole to sing a Christmas carol. But at the very first notes of \"God bless you, merry gentleman! May nothing you dismay!\", Scrooge reacted with such force, grabbing a ruler, that the singer fled in terror, leaving the keyhole exposed only to the fog and the even more welcoming frost. Eventually, the time arrived to close the counting-house. Scrooge reluctantly climbed down from his high stool, silently acknowledging to the waiting clerk in his enclosed space (Bob Cratchit) that the day was over. The clerk immediately extinguished his candle and put on his hat. \"You'll expect the whole of tomorrow off, I presume?\" said Scrooge. \"If it is quite convenient, sir,\" replied the clerk. \"It is not convenient,\" said Scrooge sharply, \"and it is not fair. If I were to deduct half-a-crown from your pay for it, you would think yourself unfairly treated, wouldn't you?\" The clerk offered a faint smile. \"And yet,\" Scrooge continued, \"you don't consider *me* unfairly treated when I pay you a day's wages for no work.\" The clerk quietly mentioned that it only happened once a year. \"A weak excuse for picking a man's pocket every twenty-fifth of December!\" said Scrooge, buttoning his overcoat up to his chin. \"But I suppose you must have the entire day. Just make sure you are here even earlier the following morning.\" The clerk promised he would be; and Scrooge walked out, muttering discontentedly. The office was shut in an instant, and the clerk, with the long ends of his white scarf dangling below his waist (as he owned no overcoat), joined a line of boys sliding down an icy patch on Cornhill twenty times in celebration of Christmas Eve, before running home to Camden Town as fast as he could manage, eager to play blind man's buff.",

The old church tower, whose rough bell often peered slyly at Scrooge from its Gothic window, disappeared from sight, its chimes echoing muffled in the clouds like it was shivering from the cold. The temperature dropped even further. On the main street, by the entrance to the court, some workers fixing the gas lines had built a big fire in a brazier; a group of poor men and boys stood around it, delighting in the warmth, faces lit with joy. Water from the unattended water pump froze into a hard, unfriendly block of ice. The glow from shop windows, decorated with holly and berries crackling from the heat of the lamps, made the pale faces of passersby glow red. The poulterers and grocers were bustling with activity, looking so lively and festive it seemed impossible that mere buying and selling was taking place. Inside the grand Mansion House, the Lord Mayor ordered his many cooks and butlers to prepare for Christmas as befits his status; and even the humble tailor, recently fined by the Mayor for drunkenness, busied himself making the Christmas pudding in his tiny room, while his thin wife and child went out to buy beef.\n\nThe fog grew thicker and the air colder, biting and sharp. If Saint Dunstan had pinched the Devil's nose with such cold rather than with tongs, the Devil would have howled in pain. A child, his nose red and raw from the cold, bent to sing a Christmas carol at Scrooge's door. But as soon as he began, Scrooge angrily grabbed a ruler, scaring the boy away and leaving the keyhole to the freezing air.\n\nFinally, it was time to close the office. Scrooge reluctantly got down from his seat, silently acknowledging to his waiting clerk that it was closing time. The clerk immediately blew out his candle and put on his hat.\n\n\"You'll want the whole day off tomorrow, I suppose?\" Scrooge asked.\n\n\"If it's not too much trouble, sir,\"\n\n\"It's not convenient,\" Scrooge replied, \"and it's not fair. If I deducted half a crown for it, you'd think yourself mistreated, wouldn't you?\"\n\nThe clerk managed a weak smile.\n\n\"And yet,\" Scrooge continued, \"you don’t see me as mistreating you when I pay you for a full day with no work.\"\n\nThe clerk pointed out that it was only once a year.\n\n\"A poor excuse for picking a man's pocket every December 25th!\" Scrooge grumbled, buttoning up his coat. \"But I suppose you must take the whole day off. Be here extra early the next morning.\"\n\nThe clerk promised he would, and Scrooge left in a bad mood. The office closed instantly, and the clerk—without a coat but with his long white scarf hanging down—joined some boys to slide on the ice in celebration of Christmas Eve, then hurried home to play blindman's buff with his family."

He lived in chambers which had once belonged to his deceased partner. They were a gloomy suite of rooms, in a lowering pile of building up a yard, where it had so little business to be, that one could scarcely help fancying it must have run there when it was a young house, playing at hide-and-seek with other houses, and forgotten the way out again. It was old enough now, and dreary enough, for nobody lived in it but Scrooge, the other rooms being all let out as offices. The yard was so dark that even Scrooge, who knew its every stone, was fain to grope with his hands. The fog and frost so hung about the black old gateway of the house, that it seemed as if the Genius of the Weather sat in mournful meditation on the threshold.\nNow, it is a fact, that there was nothing at all particular about the knocker on the door, except that it was very large. It is also a fact, that Scrooge had seen it, night and morning, during his whole residence in that place; also that Scrooge had as little of what is called fancy about him as any man in the city of London, even including—which is a bold word—the corporation, aldermen, and livery. Let it also be borne in mind that Scrooge had not bestowed one thought on Marley, since his last mention of his seven years’ dead partner that afternoon. And then let any man explain to me, if he can, how it happened that Scrooge, having his key in the lock of the door, saw in the knocker, without its undergoing any intermediate process of change—not a knocker, but Marley’s face.\nMarley’s face. It was not in impenetrable shadow as the other objects in the yard were, but had a dismal light about it, like a bad lobster in a dark cellar. It was not angry or ferocious, but looked at Scrooge as Marley used to look: with ghostly spectacles turned up on its ghostly forehead. The hair was curiously stirred, as if by breath or hot air; and, though the eyes were wide open, they were perfectly motionless. That, and its livid colour, made it horrible; but its horror seemed to be in spite of the face and beyond its control, rather than a part of its own expression.\nAs Scrooge looked fixedly at this phenomenon, it was a knocker again.\nTo say that he was not startled, or that his blood was not conscious of a terrible sensation to which it had been a stranger from infancy, would be untrue. But he put his hand upon the key he had relinquished, turned it sturdily, walked in, and lighted his candle.\nHe did pause, with a moment’s irresolution, before he shut the door; and he did look cautiously behind it first, as if he half expected to be terrified with the sight of Marley’s pigtail sticking out into the hall. But there was nothing on the back of the door, except the screws and nuts that held the knocker on, so he said “Pooh, pooh!” and closed it with a bang.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "Scrooge ate his customary bleak meal at his usual somber pub. After reading all the newspapers and spending the rest of the evening focused on his bank book, he went home to bed. He resided in rooms that had previously belonged to his deceased business partner. They were a gloomy set of rooms within a foreboding building located in a yard, which seemed so out of place that one could imagine it had run there as a young structure playing hide-and-seek and forgotten how to get back out. It was certainly old and desolate enough now, with Scrooge being the only occupant, as the other rooms were rented out as offices. The yard was so dim that even Scrooge, who was very familiar with it, had to feel his way. The fog and frost clung so heavily around the building's dark, old entrance that it appeared as though the Spirit of the Weather was sitting on the doorstep in sorrowful contemplation. It's a known fact that the only remarkable thing about the door knocker was its large size. It's also true that Scrooge had seen it every single night and morning throughout his time living there. Furthermore, Scrooge possessed as little imagination or whimsy as anyone in the entire city of London, including—and this is a strong claim—the city's governing body, aldermen, and liverymen. Bear in mind also that Scrooge had not given a single thought to Marley since mentioning his partner, dead for seven years, earlier that afternoon. So, let anyone who can explain how Scrooge, while inserting his key into the door lock, saw not the knocker, but Marley's face, without any gradual change occurring. It was Marley's face. It wasn't completely hidden in the shadows like the other objects in the yard, but had a faint, unpleasant glow around it, resembling a spoiled lobster in a dark cellar. It didn't look angry or fierce, but stared at Scrooge just as Marley used to: with spectral spectacles pushed up onto its spectral forehead. The hair seemed oddly disturbed, as if by a breath or warm air, and although the eyes were wide open, they were completely unmoving. This, along with its pale, unnatural colour, made it terrifying; yet, the horror seemed to be independent of the face itself and beyond its control, rather than being part of its expression. As Scrooge stared intently at this strange sight, it turned back into a knocker. It would be false to claim that he wasn't startled, or that his body didn't experience a terrible sensation it had never felt before. But he put his hand back on the key he had momentarily let go of, turned it firmly, entered, and lit his candle. He did hesitate for a moment, unsure, before closing the door; and he did look cautiously behind it first, as if half-expecting to be frightened by the sight of Marley's pigtail sticking into the hall. But there was nothing on the back of the door except the nuts and screws holding the knocker in place, so he scoffed, \"Pooh, pooh!\" and slammed it shut loudly.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "Scrooge ate his lonely dinner at his regular, somber tavern, spent some time reading all the newspapers, and passed the rest of the evening going over his bank book before heading home to bed. He lived in rooms that used to belong to his late business partner. These rooms were dark and unwelcoming, situated in a cheerless building tucked away in a yard where one might think the structure ended up by accident and got lost among its neighbors. Now old and dreary, the building was mainly rented out as offices; only Scrooge lived there. The yard was so poorly lit that even Scrooge, who knew the place well, had to feel his way along. Thick fog and frost clung to the dark entrance, making it seem like the spirit of the weather sat sadly at the doorway.\n\nThere was nothing remarkable about the door knocker, besides its large size. Scrooge had seen it countless times, morning and night, and he was not a fanciful man—at least not more so than any other Londoner. Remember too, Scrooge hadn’t thought about Marley, his partner who died seven years earlier, since briefly mentioning him that afternoon. But then, as he was putting his key in the lock, Scrooge saw, without any process of change, Marley’s face instead of the knocker.\n\nMarley’s face had a faint, eerie glow unlike the shadows covering everything else in the yard; it reminded Scrooge of the look of a spoiled lobster found in a dark cellar. The expression was not angry, but it looked at him just as Marley used to, with ghostly glasses perched on its ghostly forehead. Its hair seemed strangely disturbed, as by some breeze or heat, and although its eyes were wide open, they did not move. Its pale, lifeless color added to the horrific effect, but the terror came more from the unnaturalness of it than Marley’s expression itself.\n\nAs Scrooge stared, the apparition vanished, and the knocker was normal again.\n\nHe was certainly startled—his body felt a chill it hadn't known since childhood. Nevertheless, he took up the key again, turned it firmly, entered, and lit his candle. He did hesitate for a moment before shutting the door, cautiously checking behind it as if half expecting to see Marley’s pigtail, but there was nothing there except the screws holding the knocker. Dismissing his fears, he exclaimed \"Pooh, pooh!\" and shut the door loudly."

          "text_segment": "The sound resounded through the house like thunder. Every room above, and every cask in the wine-merchant’s cellars below, appeared to have a separate peal of echoes of its own. Scrooge was not a man to be frightened by echoes. He fastened the door, and walked across the hall, and up the stairs; slowly too: trimming his candle as he went.\nYou may talk vaguely about driving a coach-and-six up a good old flight of stairs, or through a bad young Act of Parliament; but I mean to say you might have got a hearse up that staircase, and taken it broadwise, with the splinter-bar towards the wall and the door towards the balustrades: and done it easy. There was plenty of width for that, and room to spare; which is perhaps the reason why Scrooge thought he saw a locomotive hearse going on before him in the gloom. Half-a-dozen gas-lamps out of the street wouldn’t have lighted the entry too well, so you may suppose that it was pretty dark with Scrooge’s dip.\nUp Scrooge went, not caring a button for that. Darkness is cheap, and Scrooge liked it. But before he shut his heavy door, he walked through his rooms to see that all was right. He had just enough recollection of the face to desire to do that.\nSitting-room, bedroom, lumber-room. All as they should be. Nobody under the table, nobody under the sofa; a small fire in the grate; spoon and basin ready; and the little saucepan of gruel (Scrooge had a cold in his head) upon the hob. Nobody under the bed; nobody in the closet; nobody in his dressing-gown, which was hanging up in a suspicious attitude against the wall. Lumber-room as usual. Old fire-guard, old shoes, two fish-baskets, washing-stand on three legs, and a poker.\nQuite satisfied, he closed his door, and locked himself in; double-locked himself in, which was not his custom. Thus secured against surprise, he took off his cravat; put on his dressing-gown and slippers, and his nightcap; and sat down before the fire to take his gruel.\nIt was a very low fire indeed; nothing on such a bitter night. He was obliged to sit close to it, and brood over it, before he could extract the least sensation of warmth from such a handful of fuel. The fireplace was an old one, built by some Dutch merchant long ago, and paved all round with quaint Dutch tiles, designed to illustrate the Scriptures. There were Cains and Abels, Pharaoh’s daughters; Queens of Sheba, Angelic messengers descending through the air on clouds like feather-beds, Abrahams, Belshazzars, Apostles putting off to sea in butter-boats, hundreds of figures to attract his thoughts; and yet that face of Marley, seven years dead, came like the ancient Prophet’s rod, and swallowed up the whole. If each smooth tile had been a blank at first, with power to shape some picture on its surface from the disjointed fragments of his thoughts, there would have been a copy of old Marley’s head on every one.\n“Humbug!” said Scrooge; and walked across the room.\nAfter several turns, he sat down again. As he threw his head back in the chair, his glance happened to rest upon a bell, a disused bell, that hung in the room, and communicated for some purpose now forgotten with a chamber in the highest story of the building. It was with great astonishment, and with a strange, inexplicable dread, that as he looked, he saw this bell begin to swing. It swung so softly in the outset that it scarcely made a sound; but soon it rang out loudly, and so did every bell in the house.\nThis might have lasted half a minute, or a minute, but it seemed an hour. The bells ceased as they had begun, together. They were succeeded by a clanking noise, deep down below; as if some person were dragging a heavy chain over the casks in the wine-merchant’s cellar. Scrooge then remembered to have heard that ghosts in haunted houses were described as dragging chains.\nThe cellar-door flew open with a booming sound, and then he heard the noise much louder, on the floors below; then coming up the stairs; then coming straight towards his door.\n“It’s humbug still!” said Scrooge. “I won’t believe it.”\nHis colour changed though, when, without a pause, it came on through the heavy door, and passed into the room before his eyes. Upon its coming in, the dying flame leaped up, as though it cried, “I know him; Marley’s Ghost!” and fell again.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "The noise echoed through the residence like thunder. Every chamber upstairs and every barrel in the wine merchant's cellar below seemed to generate a unique set of returning sounds. Scrooge was not a person easily intimidated by echoes. He secured the entryway, crossed the foyer, and climbed the staircase; he did so slowly, adjusting his candle's wick as he ascended. One might speak generally about maneuvering a six-horse carriage up a grand old flight of stairs or through a problematic new law, but I mean to say you could have easily brought a hearse up that stairway, even sideways, with the front pole pointing towards the wall and the door towards the banister, and accomplished it with ease. There was plenty of width for that, and space left over; which perhaps explains why Scrooge imagined he saw a phantom hearse moving ahead of him in the dimness. Even half a dozen street gas lamps wouldn't have adequately lit the entrance, so you can infer it was quite dark with Scrooge's small candle. Scrooge proceeded upward, entirely unconcerned by the lack of light. Darkness is inexpensive, and Scrooge favored it. But before he shut his heavy door, he went through his rooms to make sure everything was in order. He had just enough recollection of the face he'd seen to feel the need to do this. His living room, bedroom, and storage room were all as they should be. No one was concealed under the table, no one under the sofa; a small fire flickered in the grate; a spoon and bowl were ready; and the little pot of gruel (Scrooge had a head cold) sat on the hob. No one was under the bed; no one was in the closet; no one was inside his dressing-gown, which hung in an odd posture against the wall. The storage room was its usual self: an old fire screen, worn-out footwear, two fishing baskets, a washstand on three legs, and a metal poker. Completely satisfied, he shut his door and locked himself inside; he double-locked it, which was not his habit. Thus secured against any surprise, he removed his necktie; put on his dressing-gown, slippers, and nightcap; and settled down before the fire to consume his gruel. The fire was very small indeed; utterly inadequate on such a freezing evening. He was compelled to sit very close and lean over it before he could gain the slightest feeling of warmth from such a meager amount of fuel. The fireplace was ancient, constructed by some Dutch merchant long ago, and surrounded by unusual Dutch tiles intended to illustrate biblical stories. There were images of Cain and Abel, Pharaoh’s daughters, Queens of Sheba, angelic messengers descending on clouds resembling feather-beds, Abraham, Belshazzar, Apostles setting sail in small boats – hundreds of figures to potentially occupy his thoughts; and yet that image of Marley's face, dead for seven years, appeared like the ancient Prophet's staff, and consumed everything else. If each smooth tile had initially been blank, capable of forming an image from the fragmented pieces of his thoughts, a likeness of old Marley's head would have appeared on every single one. “Nonsense!” Scrooge declared, and he paced across the room. After walking back and forth several times, he sat down again. As he leaned his head back in the chair, his eyes happened to fall upon a bell, one that was no longer used, which hung in the room and had once connected to a chamber on the top floor for some forgotten purpose. It was with profound astonishment, and with a strange, inexplicable apprehension, that as he watched, he saw this bell begin to sway. Initially, it swung so gently that it produced hardly any sound; but soon it began to ring loudly, and simultaneously, every other bell in the house rang out. This might have lasted half a minute, or a minute, but it felt like an hour. The bells stopped ringing together, just as they had started. They were succeeded by a clanking noise, originating from deep below; as if someone were dragging a heavy chain over the barrels in the wine merchant’s cellar. Scrooge then remembered hearing that ghosts in haunted houses were often described as dragging chains. The cellar door burst open with a loud sound, and then he heard the noise much louder on the floors below; then it came up the stairs; then it came directly towards his door. “It’s still nonsense!” said Scrooge. “I refuse to believe it.” His complexion changed, however, when, without any pause, it passed right through the solid door and entered the room before his eyes. Upon its arrival, the dying fire's flame leaped up, as if shouting, “I recognize him; it’s Marley’s Ghost!” and then subsided again.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "A loud noise echoed throughout the house like thunder, with each room above and each barrel in the wine cellar seemingly producing its own set of echoes. Scrooge was not someone easily scared by such things. He secured the door, crossed the hallway, and climbed the stairs at a deliberate pace, adjusting his candle as he went. People might talk about how wide his stairs were—wide enough to drive a horse-drawn carriage, or even a hearse, up them with ease—perhaps so wide Scrooge imagined seeing a phantom hearse ahead of him in the shadows. The entryway was very dark; even several street lamps would not have made it bright, so Scrooge’s single candle barely helped. Still, Scrooge wasn’t worried—he preferred the darkness, finding it economical. Before locking up for the night, he inspected each room to make sure everything was in order, motivated by a faint memory of a face. He checked the sitting-room, bedroom, and storage room; everything was as it should be—no one hiding anywhere, a modest fire burning, his gruel ready on the stove since he had a cold. He examined all the usual places—under the bed, in the closet, behind his dressing-gown—but found nothing amiss. Once satisfied, he locked himself in very securely, which was unusual for him. He changed into his nightclothes and sat by the fire to eat his gruel. The fire was small and hardly provided warmth, so Scrooge huddled close to it. The fireplace, built long ago by a Dutch merchant, was surrounded by interesting tiles depicting Biblical scenes. These images could have distracted him, but the memory of Marley’s face, dead seven years, forced all other thoughts from his mind. It was as if his mind kept seeing Marley’s face on every tile. \"Nonsense!\" muttered Scrooge, pacing the room. After a while, he sat back down and noticed an old, unused bell hanging in the room, connected to a distant part of the house. To his shock and fear, he saw the bell begin to move—swinging so softly at first it was barely audible, but soon all the bells in the house rang out loudly. This cacophony lasted for what felt like a long time but was only a moment. When the bells stopped, the sound of chains dragging echoed from below, as if someone were hauling something heavy through the cellar. Scrooge recalled stories of ghosts dragging chains through haunted houses. The cellar door burst open, and the clanking noise grew louder as it moved up through the house to his very door. Scrooge tried to dismiss it as nonsense, insisting he wouldn’t believe what was happening. But when the sound passed through his locked door and into the room, his face changed color. As the apparition entered, the dying fire flared up briefly as if to say, “I recognize him—Marley’s Ghost!” then sank down again."

          "text_segment": "The same face: the very same. Marley in his pigtail, usual waistcoat, tights and boots; the tassels on the latter bristling, like his pigtail, and his coat-skirts, and the hair upon his head. The chain he drew was clasped about his middle. It was long, and wound about him like a tail; and it was made (for Scrooge observed it closely) of cash-boxes, keys, padlocks, ledgers, deeds, and heavy purses wrought in steel. His body was transparent; so that Scrooge, observing him, and looking through his waistcoat, could see the two buttons on his coat behind.\nScrooge had often heard it said that Marley had no bowels, but he had never believed it until now.\nNo, nor did he believe it even now. Though he looked the phantom through and through, and saw it standing before him; though he felt the chilling influence of its death-cold eyes; and marked the very texture of the folded kerchief bound about its head and chin, which wrapper he had not observed before; he was still incredulous, and fought against his senses.\n“How now!” said Scrooge, caustic and cold as ever. “What do you want with me?”\n“Much!”—Marley’s voice, no doubt about it.\n“Who are you?”\n“Ask me who I was.”\n“Who were you then?” said Scrooge, raising his voice. “You’re particular, for a shade.” He was going to say “to a shade,” but substituted this, as more appropriate.\n“In life I was your partner, Jacob Marley.”\n“Can you—can you sit down?” asked Scrooge, looking doubtfully at him.\n“I can.”\n“Do it, then.”\nScrooge asked the question, because he didn’t know whether a ghost so transparent might find himself in a condition to take a chair; and felt that in the event of its being impossible, it might involve the necessity of an embarrassing explanation. But the ghost sat down on the opposite side of the fireplace, as if he were quite used to it.\n“You don’t believe in me,” observed the Ghost.\n“I don’t,” said Scrooge.\n“What evidence would you have of my reality beyond that of your senses?”\n“I don’t know,” said Scrooge.\n“Why do you doubt your senses?”\n“Because,” said Scrooge, “a little thing affects them. A slight disorder of the stomach makes them cheats. You may be an undigested bit of beef, a blot of mustard, a crumb of cheese, a fragment of an underdone potato. There’s more of gravy than of grave about you, whatever you are!”\nScrooge was not much in the habit of cracking jokes, nor did he feel, in his heart, by any means waggish then. The truth is, that he tried to be smart, as a means of distracting his own attention, and keeping down his terror; for the spectre’s voice disturbed the very marrow in his bones.\nTo sit, staring at those fixed glazed eyes, in silence for a moment, would play, Scrooge felt, the very deuce with him. There was something very awful, too, in the spectre’s being provided with an infernal atmosphere of its own. Scrooge could not feel it himself, but this was clearly the case; for though the Ghost sat perfectly motionless, its hair, and skirts, and tassels, were still agitated as by the hot vapour from an oven.\n“You see this toothpick?” said Scrooge, returning quickly to the charge, for the reason just assigned; and wishing, though it were only for a second, to divert the vision’s stony gaze from himself.\n“I do,” replied the Ghost.\n“You are not looking at it,” said Scrooge.\n“But I see it,” said the Ghost, “notwithstanding.”\n“Well!” returned Scrooge, “I have but to swallow this, and be for the rest of my days persecuted by a legion of goblins, all of my own creation. Humbug, I tell you! humbug!”\nAt this the spirit raised a frightful cry, and shook its chain with such a dismal and appalling noise, that Scrooge held on tight to his chair, to save himself from falling in a swoon. But how much greater was his horror, when the phantom taking off the bandage round its head, as if it were too warm to wear indoors, its lower jaw dropped down upon its breast!\nScrooge fell upon his knees, and clasped his hands before his face.\n“Mercy!” he said. “Dreadful apparition, why do you trouble me?”\n“Man of the worldly mind!” replied the Ghost, “do you believe in me or not?”\n“I do,” said Scrooge. “I must. But why do spirits walk the earth, and why do they come to me?”\n“It is required of every man,” the Ghost returned, “that the spirit within him should walk abroad among his fellowmen, and travel far and wide; and if that spirit goes not forth in life, it is condemned to do so after death. It is doomed to wander through the world—oh, woe is me!—and witness what it cannot share, but might have shared on earth, and turned to happiness!”\nAgain the spectre raised a cry, and shook its chain and wrung its shadowy hands.\n“You are fettered,” said Scrooge, trembling. “Tell me why?”\n“I wear the chain I forged in life,” replied the Ghost. “I made it link by link, and yard by yard; I girded it on of my own free will, and of my own free will I wore it. Is its pattern strange to you?”\nScrooge trembled more and more.\n“Or would you know,” pursued the Ghost, “the weight and length of the strong coil you bear yourself? It was full as heavy and as long as this, seven Christmas Eves ago. You have laboured on it, since. It is a ponderous chain!”\nScrooge glanced about him on the floor, in the expectation of finding himself surrounded by some fifty or sixty fathoms of iron cable: but he could see nothing.\n“Jacob,” he said, imploringly. “Old Jacob Marley, tell me more. Speak comfort to me, Jacob!”\n“I have none to give,” the Ghost replied. “It comes from other regions, Ebenezer Scrooge, and is conveyed by other ministers, to other kinds of men. Nor can I tell you what I would. A very little more is all permitted to me. I cannot rest, I cannot stay, I cannot linger anywhere. My spirit never walked beyond our counting-house—mark me!—in life my spirit never roved beyond the narrow limits of our money-changing hole; and weary journeys lie before me!”\nIt was a habit with Scrooge, whenever he became thoughtful, to put his hands in his breeches pockets. Pondering on what the Ghost had said, he did so now, but without lifting up his eyes, or getting off his knees.\n“You must have been very slow about it, Jacob,” Scrooge observed, in a business-like manner, though with humility and deference.\n“Slow!” the Ghost repeated.\n“Seven years dead,” mused Scrooge. “And travelling all the time!”\n“The whole time,” said the Ghost. “No rest, no peace. Incessant torture of remorse.”\n“You travel fast?” said Scrooge.\n“On the wings of the wind,” replied the Ghost.\n“You might have got over a great quantity of ground in seven years,” said Scrooge.\nThe Ghost, on hearing this, set up another cry, and clanked its chain so hideously in the dead silence of the night, that the Ward would have been justified in indicting it for a nuisance.\n“Oh! captive, bound, and double-ironed,” cried the phantom, “not to know, that ages of incessant labour by immortal creatures, for this earth must pass into eternity before the good of which it is susceptible is all developed. Not to know that any Christian spirit working kindly in its little sphere, whatever it may be, will find its mortal life too short for its vast means of usefulness. Not to know that no space of regret can make amends for one life’s opportunity misused! Yet such was I! Oh! such was I!”\n“But you were always a good man of business, Jacob,” faltered Scrooge, who now began to apply this to himself.\n“Business!” cried the Ghost, wringing its hands again. “Mankind was my business. The common welfare was my business; charity, mercy, forbearance, and benevolence, were, all, my business. The dealings of my trade were but a drop of water in the comprehensive ocean of my business!”\nIt held up its chain at arm’s length, as if that were the cause of all its unavailing grief, and flung it heavily upon the ground again.\n“At this time of the rolling year,” the spectre said, “I suffer most. Why did I walk through crowds of fellow-beings with my eyes turned down, and never raise them to that blessed Star which led the Wise Men to a poor abode! Were there no poor homes to which its light would have conducted me!”\nScrooge was very much dismayed to hear the spectre going on at this rate, and began to quake exceedingly.\n“Hear me!” cried the Ghost. “My time is nearly gone.”\n“I will,” said Scrooge. “But don’t be hard upon me! Don’t be flowery, Jacob! Pray!”\n“How it is that I appear before you in a shape that you can see, I may not tell. I have sat invisible beside you many and many a day.”\nIt was not an agreeable idea. Scrooge shivered, and wiped the perspiration from his brow.\n“That is no light part of my penance,” pursued the Ghost. “I am here to-night to warn you, that you have yet a chance and hope of escaping my fate. A chance and hope of my procuring, Ebenezer.”\n“You were always a good friend to me,” said Scrooge. “Thank’ee!”\n“You will be haunted,” resumed the Ghost, “by Three Spirits.”\nScrooge’s countenance fell almost as low as the Ghost’s had done.\n“Is that the chance and hope you mentioned, Jacob?” he demanded, in a faltering voice.\n“It is.”\n“I—I think I’d rather not,” said Scrooge.\n“Without their visits,” said the Ghost, “you cannot hope to shun the path I tread.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "The spectral figure was identical to Marley, right down to his pigtail, customary vest, leggings, and boots. The tassels on his boots, like his pigtail, coat tails, and hair, seemed to stand on end. Wrapped around his waist was the chain he dragged. It was long and coiled around him like a tail, constructed, Scrooge noted upon close inspection, from cash-boxes, keys, padlocks, ledgers, legal documents, and heavy metal purses. His form was see-through, allowing Scrooge to look through his vest and see the two buttons on the back of his coat. Scrooge had often heard talk of Marley lacking internal organs, but he had never believed it until this moment. However, even now, he couldn't fully accept it. Although he saw straight through the phantom and observed it standing before him, and felt the chilling effect of its lifeless eyes, and even noticed the exact texture of the folded cloth wrapped around its head and chin (a detail he hadn't seen before), he remained skeptical and struggled against his senses. “Well, then!” Scrooge said, as sharp and cold as ever. “What do you want from me?” “A great deal!” Without a doubt, it was Marley's voice. “Who are you?” “Ask me who I was.” “Who were you, then?” Scrooge asked, raising his voice. “You're particular for a ghost.” He originally intended to say “to a shade,” but changed it for better phrasing. “In life, I was your business partner, Jacob Marley.” “Can you—can you sit down?” Scrooge inquired, looking at him with uncertainty. “I can.” “Then do it.” Scrooge posed the question because he wasn't sure if such a transparent ghost could manage to sit in a chair, and he felt that if it were impossible, it might lead to an awkward explanation. But the ghost settled into a chair across from the fireplace as if it were perfectly normal for him. “You don't believe in me,” the Ghost remarked. “I do not,” Scrooge confirmed. “What proof of my existence would satisfy you, beyond what your senses tell you?” “I don't know,” said Scrooge. “Why do you doubt your senses?” “Because,” Scrooge explained, “they are easily fooled. A minor stomach upset can make them deceive me. You could be a bit of undigested beef, a smear of mustard, a crumb of cheese, or a piece of undercooked potato. You look more like a product of indigestion than a visitor from the grave, whatever you are!” Scrooge was not prone to making jokes, nor did he feel humorous at all in his heart just then. The truth was, he was trying to sound witty to divert his own attention and suppress his fear, as the spectre's voice unnerved him deeply. Scrooge felt that just sitting and silently staring at those fixed, vacant eyes for even a moment would completely unnerve him. There was also something truly terrifying about the spectre carrying its own unnaturally hot atmosphere. Scrooge himself couldn't feel it, but it was clearly present; even though the Ghost sat perfectly still, its hair, coat tails, and tassels were constantly moving as if stirred by hot air from an oven. “Do you see this toothpick?” Scrooge asked, quickly returning to the offensive for the reason just mentioned, hoping, even for just a second, to redirect the vision's fixed gaze away from himself. “I do,” the Ghost replied. “You aren't looking at it,” said Scrooge. “But I perceive it,” the Ghost stated, “nonetheless.” “Fine!” Scrooge retorted, “I only need to swallow this, and I'll be tormented for the rest of my days by a horde of goblins I've conjured myself. Nonsense, I tell you! Nonsense!” At this, the spirit let out a terrifying shriek and rattled its chain with such a dreadful and appalling noise that Scrooge grabbed his chair tightly to keep from fainting. But his horror intensified when the phantom removed the cloth wrapping its head, as if it were too warm indoors, and its lower jaw dropped onto its chest! Scrooge fell to his knees, covering his face with his hands. “Mercy!” he pleaded. “Dreadful apparition, why do you trouble me?” “Man focused on worldly matters!” the Ghost responded, “do you believe in me now or not?” “I do,” said Scrooge. “I have to. But why do spirits roam the earth, and why do they appear to me?” “Every person is required,” the Ghost answered, “to let the spirit within them mingle among their fellow humans and travel widely; and if that spirit does not do so in life, it is condemned to do so after death. It is fated to wander the world—oh, misery for me!—and witness what it cannot partake in, but could have shared on earth and turned into happiness!” Again, the spectre cried out, shaking its chain and wringing its translucent hands. “You are bound,” Scrooge said, trembling. “Tell me why?” “I wear the chain I forged during my life,” the Ghost replied. “I crafted it link by link, measure by measure; I willingly put it on, and willingly wore it. Does its design seem unfamiliar to you?” Scrooge's trembling increased. “Or would you care to know,” the Ghost continued, “the weight and length of the heavy coil you yourself carry? Seven Christmas Eves ago, it was exactly as heavy and as long as this one. You've been working on it since then. It's a massive chain!” Scrooge looked around the floor, half-expecting to see himself encircled by fifty or sixty fathoms of heavy iron cable, but he saw nothing. “Jacob,” he said, pleadingly. “Old Jacob Marley, tell me more. Offer me some comfort, Jacob!” “I have none to give,” the Ghost replied. “Comfort comes from other realms, Ebenezer Scrooge, and is delivered by other agents, to different kinds of people. Nor can I tell you what I wish I could. Only a little more is allowed to me. I cannot rest, I cannot stay, I cannot linger anywhere. My spirit never ventured beyond our counting-house—mark my words!—in life, my spirit never strayed outside the narrow confines of our money-changing office; and exhausting journeys await me!” It was Scrooge's habit, whenever he was deep in thought, to put his hands in his trousers pockets. Thinking about what the Ghost had said, he did so now, but without lifting his eyes or getting off his knees. “You must have been very slow about it, Jacob,” Scrooge remarked, in a matter-of-fact tone, though with a touch of humility and respect. “Slow!” the Ghost repeated. “Seven years dead,” Scrooge mused. “And travelling constantly!” “The entire time,” said the Ghost. “No rest, no peace. Endless torment of regret.” “Do you travel quickly?” Scrooge asked. “On the wings of the wind,” the Ghost replied. “You could have covered a vast amount of distance in seven years,” Scrooge commented. Upon hearing this, the Ghost cried out again and rattled its chain so hideously in the dead silence of the night that the neighbourhood authorities would have been justified in citing it for causing a disturbance. “Oh! Imprisoned, bound, and doubly shackled,” the phantom cried, “to not realize that ages of constant effort by eternal beings on this earth must pass into eternity before all the good it is capable of is fully achieved. To not realize that any charitable Christian spirit working kindly in its small sphere, whatever it may be, will find its mortal life too short for its immense potential for usefulness. To not realize that no amount of regret can make up for squandering a lifetime's opportunity! Yet, that was me! Oh! That was me!” “But you were always a shrewd businessman, Jacob,” stammered Scrooge, who was now beginning to see the relevance for himself. “Business!” cried the Ghost, wringing its hands again. “Humanity was my business. The well-being of others was my business; charity, mercy, patience, and kindness—these were all my business. My trade dealings were merely a drop in the vast ocean of my true business!” It held up its chain at arm’s length, as if it were the source of all its futile sorrow, and then dropped it heavily onto the ground again. “At this time of year,” the spectre said, “I suffer the most. Why did I walk through crowds of people with my eyes cast down, and never look up at that blessed Star which guided the Wise Men to a humble dwelling! Were there no poor homes its light could have led me to!” Scrooge was greatly alarmed to hear the spectre speak at such length and began to tremble severely. “Listen to me!” cried the Ghost. “My time is almost up.” “I will,” said Scrooge. “But please, don’t be too hard on me! Don’t be overly elaborate, Jacob! Please!” “How I appear before you in a visible form is something I cannot explain. I have sat beside you, unseen, for many days.” This was an unsettling thought. Scrooge shivered and wiped the sweat from his brow. “That is not an insignificant part of my penance,” the Ghost continued. “I am here tonight to warn you that you still have a chance and hope of avoiding my destiny. A chance and hope that I have arranged for you, Ebenezer.” “You were always a good friend to me,” said Scrooge. “Thank you!” “You will be visited,” the Ghost resumed, “by Three Spirits.” Scrooge's face dropped, becoming almost as mournful as the Ghost's had been. “Is that the chance and hope you mentioned, Jacob?” he asked, his voice faltering. “It is.” “I—I think I’d rather not,” Scrooge said. “Without their visits,” the Ghost stated, “you cannot hope to escape the path I now follow.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "Marley appeared just as Scrooge remembered him, with his pigtail, his usual clothes, and bristling tassels. Around his waist was a long, heavy chain made up of cashboxes, locks, and documents, all forged from steel. Marley’s body was see-through, so Scrooge could even make out the buttons on his coat from behind. People had often joked that Marley had no guts, but Scrooge never believed it—yet seeing the ghost now unsettled him. Still, he resisted believing his senses even while clearly witnessing the apparition and feeling its icy gaze. Scrooge, trying to maintain his composure, brusquely asked the ghost what it wanted. Marley insisted he had much to say. Scrooge asked who he was, and Marley told him he had been his business partner in life. Scrooge, unsure if such a transparent ghost could sit, requested him to do so. To his surprise, the ghost sat as if it were perfectly normal. Marley’s ghost noticed Scrooge’s disbelief and challenged him to provide evidence that would convince him. Scrooge blamed his senses, arguing they could be fooled by indigestion and suggesting Marley might be an illusion caused by food. Scrooge tried to make light of the situation to distract himself from his fear. Scrooge even pointed to a toothpick, arguing that a simple thing could trick the mind. Marley’s ghost responded so frighteningly that Scrooge nearly fainted, especially when the ghost’s jaw dropped open upon removing his headscarf. Terrified, Scrooge begged for mercy and asked why the spirit was haunting him. Marley explained that every person’s spirit is meant to engage with others, and if neglected in life, the soul is doomed after death to wander the earth unable to help or interact with people. Scrooge asked about Marley’s chains, and Marley admitted they were forged through his own actions in life, and that Scrooge himself was building such a chain too. Scrooge pleaded for comfort, but Marley said he had none to give—the burden was the result of living a life confined to their business rather than reaching out to others. Marley elaborated that during his life, he’d missed the chance to do good and that no amount of regret can make up for a wasted life. When Scrooge protested that Marley was always a good businessman, Marley responded passionately that humanity and compassion should have been his real business, not mere profits. Marley lamented especially at Christmastime, when he realized how he had ignored the needs of others. Marley warned Scrooge that he too was at risk of this fate but that he was being given a chance to escape it: he would soon be visited by three spirits, and without these visits, Scrooge would be doomed to repeat Marley’s fate."

Look to see me no more; and look that, for your own sake, you remember what has passed between us!”\nWhen it had said these words, the spectre took its wrapper from the table, and bound it round its head, as before. Scrooge knew this, by the smart sound its teeth made, when the jaws were brought together by the bandage. He ventured to raise his eyes again, and found his supernatural visitor confronting him in an erect attitude, with its chain wound over and about its arm.\nThe apparition walked backward from him; and at every step it took, the window raised itself a little, so that when the spectre reached it, it was wide open.\nIt beckoned Scrooge to approach, which he did. When they were within two paces of each other, Marley’s Ghost held up its hand, warning him to come no nearer. Scrooge stopped.\nNot so much in obedience, as in surprise and fear: for on the raising of the hand, he became sensible of confused noises in the air; incoherent sounds of lamentation and regret; wailings inexpressibly sorrowful and self-accusatory. The spectre, after listening for a moment, joined in the mournful dirge; and floated out upon the bleak, dark night.\nScrooge followed to the window: desperate in his curiosity. He looked out.\nThe air was filled with phantoms, wandering hither and thither in restless haste, and moaning as they went. Every one of them wore chains like Marley’s Ghost; some few (they might be guilty governments) were linked together; none were free. Many had been personally known to Scrooge in their lives. He had been quite familiar with one old ghost, in a white waistcoat, with a monstrous iron safe attached to its ankle, who cried piteously at being unable to assist a wretched woman with an infant, whom it saw below, upon a door-step. The misery with them all was, clearly, that they sought to interfere, for good, in human matters, and had lost the power for ever.\nWhether these creatures faded into mist, or mist enshrouded them, he could not tell. But they and their spirit voices faded together; and the night became as it had been when he walked home.\nScrooge closed the window, and examined the door by which the Ghost had entered. It was double-locked, as he had locked it with his own hands, and the bolts were undisturbed. He tried to say “Humbug!” but stopped at the first syllable.

Do not look for me again; and ensure, for your own sake, that you remember everything that has occurred between us!\" After saying this, the spirit removed its binding from the table and rewrapped it around its head as before. Scrooge recognized this by the sharp sound made when its jaws were pressed together by the wrap. He dared to lift his eyes again and found his otherworldly guest standing upright before him, its chain coiled around its arm. The apparition walked backward away from him, and with each step it took, the window opened a little further, so that by the time the spectre reached it, it was fully open. It motioned for Scrooge to approach, which he did. When they were within two steps of each other, Marley's Ghost raised its hand, warning him not to come any closer. Scrooge stopped. His halt was due more to surprise and fear than simple obedience, for as the hand was raised, he became aware of chaotic noises in the air – jumbled sounds of sorrow and regret, agonizingly sad and self-blaming cries. The ghost listened briefly, then joined in the mournful sounds and floated out into the harsh, dark night. Driven by intense curiosity, Scrooge followed to the window and looked out. The air was filled with spirits, rushing about frantically and moaning as they went. Every one of them wore chains like Marley's Ghost; a few (perhaps representing culpable governments) were linked together; none were unbound. Many had been people Scrooge had known in life. He was quite familiar with one old ghost in a white waistcoat with a massive iron safe chained to its ankle, who wept pitifully because it was unable to help a poor woman with a baby it saw below on a doorstep. The suffering shared by all of them was clearly their unfulfilled desire to intervene constructively in human affairs, a capability they had lost forever. He couldn't tell if these beings vanished into the mist or if the mist enveloped them, but they and their ghostly voices faded simultaneously, and the night became just as it had been when he arrived home. Scrooge closed the window and inspected the door where the Ghost had entered. It was double-locked, exactly as he had locked it himself, and the bolts were untouched. He tried to utter \"Humbug!\" but stopped after the first sound. Being greatly in need of rest, whether from the emotional turmoil he had experienced, the day's exhaustion, his glimpse into the supernatural, the ghost's uninspiring talk, or the late hour, he went straight to bed without undressing and fell asleep instantly.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "\"Expect the first spirit tomorrow when the clock strikes one,\" said the ghost. \n\"Can't I have them all come at once and get it over with, Jacob?\" Scrooge asked hopefully. \n\"Expect the second the night after at the same time, and the third the following night right after midnight. You will not see me again, but remember everything that has happened here—for your own sake!\" said the ghost.\n\nWith these words, the spirit picked up its head-wrap from the table and tied it around its head as before, making a sharp sound as its jaws were tightened. Scrooge dared to look up again and saw the ghost standing upright, its chain wrapped around its arm. \n\nThe ghost began to move backward toward the window; as it did, the window opened wider with each step until it stood fully open. The ghost signaled for Scrooge to come closer, which he did, but when Scrooge got near, Marley’s Ghost raised its hand to warn him not to get any closer. Scrooge stopped—partly in fear, partly in surprise—because when the ghost raised its hand, Scrooge became aware of unsettling, sorrowful noises outside: confused cries of regret and pain. The ghost listened for a moment, then joined the unhappy chorus, and floated out into the cold, dark night. \n\nDriven by curiosity, Scrooge rushed to the window and looked out. He saw the air filled with spirits, all rushing hurriedly through the night, moaning as they went by. Each one was burdened by chains like Marley’s; some were even chained together, maybe important people from their lifetimes, but none were free. Scrooge recognized several of them as people he had known while they were alive. One familiar ghost in a white vest had a huge iron safe attached to its leg, and was sobbing because it couldn't help a helpless woman and baby on a doorstep below. It was clear that their shared agony was wanting to help the living, but being completely unable to do so ever again.\n\nScrooge couldn't tell if the spirits vanished into the mist, or if the mist simply swallowed them up, but soon both they and their cries faded away, and the night returned to normal.\n\nScrooge closed the window, checked the door the ghost had entered by—finding it still double-locked just as he had left it. He tried to declare, \"Humbug!\" but couldn’t finish the word. Feeling exhausted—whether from his emotional ordeal, the events of the day, the ghost's visit, or the late hour—he went straight to bed as he was, and immediately fell asleep."

          "text_segment": "When Scrooge awoke, it was so dark, that looking out of bed, he could scarcely distinguish the transparent window from the opaque walls of his chamber. He was endeavouring to pierce the darkness with his ferret eyes, when the chimes of a neighbouring church struck the four quarters. So he listened for the hour.\nTo his great astonishment the heavy bell went on from six to seven, and from seven to eight, and regularly up to twelve; then stopped. Twelve! It was past two when he went to bed. The clock was wrong. An icicle must have got into the works. Twelve!\nHe touched the spring of his repeater, to correct this most preposterous clock. Its rapid little pulse beat twelve: and stopped.\n“Why, it isn’t possible,” said Scrooge, “that I can have slept through a whole day and far into another night. It isn’t possible that anything has happened to the sun, and this is twelve at noon!”\nThe idea being an alarming one, he scrambled out of bed, and groped his way to the window. He was obliged to rub the frost off with the sleeve of his dressing-gown before he could see anything; and could see very little then. All he could make out was, that it was still very foggy and extremely cold, and that there was no noise of people running to and fro, and making a great stir, as there unquestionably would have been if night had beaten off bright day, and taken possession of the world. This was a great relief, because “three days after sight of this First of Exchange pay to Mr. Ebenezer Scrooge or his order,” and so forth, would have become a mere United States’ security if there were no days to count by.\nScrooge went to bed again, and thought, and thought, and thought it over and over and over, and could make nothing of it. The more he thought, the more perplexed he was; and the more he endeavoured not to think, the more he thought.\nMarley’s Ghost bothered him exceedingly. Every time he resolved within himself, after mature inquiry, that it was all a dream, his mind flew back again, like a strong spring released, to its first position, and presented the same problem to be worked all through, “Was it a dream or not?”\nScrooge lay in this state until the chime had gone three quarters more, when he remembered, on a sudden, that the Ghost had warned him of a visitation when the bell tolled one. He resolved to lie awake until the hour was passed; and, considering that he could no more go to sleep than go to Heaven, this was perhaps the wisest resolution in his power.\nThe quarter was so long, that he was more than once convinced he must have sunk into a doze unconsciously, and missed the clock. At length it broke upon his listening ear.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "Upon waking, Scrooge found it so dark that from his bed, he could barely tell his clear window from the solid walls of his room. While trying to see through the gloom with his piercing eyes, a nearby church clock struck the four quarter-hours. He then waited to hear the hour. To his great surprise, the large bell continued striking, sounding six, then seven, eight, and all the way up to twelve before stopping. Twelve o'clock! He knew he had gone to bed after two. The clock must be wrong, he thought, perhaps an icicle had frozen its mechanism. Twelve! He pressed the button on his small repeater watch to verify the time from the seemingly absurd church clock. His watch's quick, small chime also sounded twelve times and then stopped. 'That's impossible,' Scrooge said. 'I can't possibly have slept through an entire day and deep into another night. It's not possible that something has happened to the sun and this is midday!' Finding the idea unsettling, he quickly climbed out of bed and felt his way to the window. He had to rub the frost off the glass with the sleeve of his dressing gown just to see, and even then, he could make out very little. All he could discern was that it was still extremely foggy and cold, and there was none of the bustling noise of people moving about that there certainly would be if night had somehow overtaken broad daylight across the world. This quiet brought considerable relief, because financial documents like 'three days after sight of this First of Exchange pay to Mr. Ebenezer Scrooge or his order,' and similar ones, would become useless like unreliable American securities if there were no days to measure time by. Scrooge got back into bed and thought about the situation intensely, repeatedly going over it in his mind, but he couldn't understand it. The more he pondered, the more bewildered he became; and the harder he tried to stop thinking, the more his thoughts consumed him. Marley's Ghost was a major source of his confusion. Every time he concluded, after careful consideration, that it must have been just a dream, his mind would spring back, like a released elastic band, to its original state, presenting the same persistent question: 'Was it a dream or wasn't it?' Scrooge remained in this state until the clock chimed three more quarter-hours. Then, suddenly, he remembered that the Ghost had warned him he would be visited when the bell struck one. He decided to remain awake until after that hour. Given that he was completely unable to fall asleep anyway, this was probably the most sensible decision he could make. The waiting period felt so long that he was more than once certain he must have unconsciously fallen asleep and missed the chime. Finally, he heard it sound to his waiting ear.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "When Scrooge woke up, it was so dark in his room that he could barely tell the window apart from the walls. He tried to see through the darkness with his sharp eyes, when he heard the nearby church clock strike the quarters. Curious, he listened for the hour. To his amazement, the heavy bell rang from six to twelve before stopping. Twelve o’clock! He knew it was after two when he had gone to bed, so he figured the clock must be wrong—maybe an icicle was interfering with it. Still disbelieving, he checked his own repeater watch, but it too struck twelve and stopped. \"It can’t be,\" Scrooge said aloud, \"I couldn’t have slept through an entire day and into another night. It can’t be noon and something happened to the sun!\" Alarmed by the thought, he jumped out of bed and felt his way to the window. He had to scrape frost from the pane with his sleeve to see out, but even then he could only make out that it was still foggy and very cold, with no people rushing in alarm—as surely would be the case if night had replaced day. This comforted him, since business depended on the passage of days. Scrooge returned to bed, mulling over what had happened again and again, growing more confused and frustrated the more he thought about it. The idea of Marley’s Ghost haunted him. Whenever he convinced himself it had just been a dream, his mind snapped back to wondering if it was real after all. Lying awake in this state, he suddenly remembered that the Ghost had warned he would be visited when the clock struck one. He resolved to stay awake until then, figuring this was the best choice since he knew he couldn’t fall asleep. The quarter-hour felt so long he feared he must have dozed and missed the time, but at last, the chime reached his attentive ears."

Light flashed up in the room upon the instant, and the curtains of his bed were drawn.\nThe curtains of his bed were drawn aside, I tell you, by a hand. Not the curtains at his feet, nor the curtains at his back, but those to which his face was addressed. The curtains of his bed were drawn aside; and Scrooge, starting up into a half-recumbent attitude, found himself face to face with the unearthly visitor who drew them: as close to it as I am now to you, and I am standing in the spirit at your elbow.\nIt was a strange figure—like a child: yet not so like a child as like an old man, viewed through some supernatural medium, which gave him the appearance of having receded from the view, and being diminished to a child’s proportions. Its hair, which hung about its neck and down its back, was white as if with age; and yet the face had not a wrinkle in it, and the tenderest bloom was on the skin. The arms were very long and muscular; the hands the same, as if its hold were of uncommon strength. Its legs and feet, most delicately formed, were, like those upper members, bare. It wore a tunic of the purest white; and round its waist was bound a lustrous belt, the sheen of which was beautiful. It held a branch of fresh green holly in its hand; and, in singular contradiction of that wintry emblem, had its dress trimmed with summer flowers. But the strangest thing about it was, that from the crown of its head there sprung a bright clear jet of light, by which all this was visible; and which was doubtless the occasion of its using, in its duller moments, a great extinguisher for a cap, which it now held under its arm.\nEven this, though, when Scrooge looked at it with increasing steadiness, was not its strangest quality. For as its belt sparkled and glittered now in one part and now in another, and what was light one instant, at another time was dark, so the figure itself fluctuated in its distinctness: being now a thing with one arm, now with one leg, now with twenty legs, now a pair of legs without a head, now a head without a body: of which dissolving parts, no outline would be visible in the dense gloom wherein they melted away. And in the very wonder of this, it would be itself again; distinct and clear as ever.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "Scrooge counted the clock's chimes, noting a quarter past, then half past, then a quarter to the hour. Triumphantly, he declared it was the hour itself, with nothing unusual occurring. Just as he said this, the hour bell sounded with a deep, sad 'One'. Immediately, the room lit up, and his bed curtains were pulled back. The narrator specifies that the curtains by his face were drawn aside by a hand. Scrooge quickly sat up and found himself directly facing the strange, unearthly visitor who had opened them, as close as the narrator feels to the reader.  The figure was peculiar, resembling a child but also like an old man seen through a supernatural lens, making it appear distant and reduced to a child's size. Its hair was white like that of an elderly person, yet its face was smooth and youthful. Its arms and hands were long and powerful. Its legs and feet were finely formed and, like its upper limbs, were bare. It wore a pure white tunic and a bright, beautiful belt. It held a branch of green holly, but its dress was also adorned with summer flowers, a strange contrast. Most remarkably, a clear, bright light shone from the top of its head, illuminating everything and likely explaining the large extinguisher-shaped cap it carried under its arm. However, even stranger than this light was the figure's constantly shifting form. As its belt flickered between light and dark, the figure itself would become indistinct, appearing at times with missing or extra limbs, or just parts of a body, which would then vanish into the surrounding gloom. Yet, suddenly, it would become whole and clear again.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "\"Ding, dong!\" The bell chimed. \"It's a quarter past,\" Scrooge noted as he kept count. Again, \"Ding, dong!\" rang out. \"Half past now!\" he said. The bell sounded once more. \"A quarter to the hour,\" Scrooge remarked. Then another, \"Ding, dong!\" \"The hour itself!\" Scrooge declared victoriously, convinced that nothing more would happen. He spoke even before the main hour bell rang out, which it now did with a single, low, hollow, sorrowful chime. Suddenly, light filled the room and the bed curtains opened. Not the ones at his feet or behind him, but those right before his face, pulled back by a hand. Scrooge startled up, halfway sitting, and came face to face with the ghostly visitor who had drawn the curtains—all so close as if the narrator stood beside you now. The figure was strange—like a child, but also like an old man, as if age and youth mixed through supernatural means to give it the shape of a child though its hair was white with age. Yet its face was smooth and youthful. Its arms and hands were long and strong, its feet and legs delicate and bare, and it wore a shining white tunic with a sparkling belt at the waist. One hand held a fresh green holly branch, and its outfit was decorated with summer flowers despite the holly’s wintry meaning. Most remarkable, a bright jet of light shone from its head, illuminating everything, and it carried a large extinguisher-like cap under its arm for duller moments. Still, this was not the most peculiar aspect—its appearance kept changing as Scrooge looked more intently: its belt glittered first here, then there; its form wavered from having one arm to twenty legs, shifting in and out of focus and sometimes dissolving parts into the darkness. Yet, suddenly, it always returned to its clear, distinct shape."

The city had entirely vanished. Not a vestige of it was to be seen. The darkness and the mist had vanished with it, for it was a clear, cold, winter day, with snow upon the ground.\n“Good Heaven!” said Scrooge, clasping his hands together, as he looked about him. “I was bred in this place. I was a boy here!”\nThe Spirit gazed upon him mildly. Its gentle touch, though it had been light and instantaneous, appeared still present to the old man’s sense of feeling. He was conscious of a thousand odours floating in the air, each one connected with a thousand thoughts, and hopes, and joys, and cares long, long, forgotten!\n“Your lip is trembling,” said the Ghost. “And what is that upon your cheek?”\nScrooge muttered, with an unusual catching in his voice, that it was a pimple; and begged the Ghost to lead him where he would.\n“You recollect the way?” inquired the Spirit.\n“Remember it!” cried Scrooge with fervour; “I could walk it blindfold.”\n“Strange to have forgotten it for so many years!” observed the Ghost. “Let us go on.”\nThey walked along the road, Scrooge recognising every gate, and post, and tree; until a little market-town appeared in the distance, with its bridge, its church, and winding river. Some shaggy ponies now were seen trotting towards them with boys upon their backs, who called to other boys in country gigs and carts, driven by farmers. All these boys were in great spirits, and shouted to each other, until the broad fields were so full of merry music, that the crisp air laughed to hear it!\n“These are but shadows of the things that have been,” said the Ghost. “They have no consciousness of us.”\nThe jocund travellers came on; and as they came, Scrooge knew and named them every one. Why was he rejoiced beyond all bounds to see them! Why did his cold eye glisten, and his heart leap up as they went past! Why was he filled with gladness when he heard them give each other Merry Christmas, as they parted at cross-roads and bye-ways, for their several homes! What was merry Christmas to Scrooge? Out upon merry Christmas! What good had it ever done to him?\n“The school is not quite deserted,” said the Ghost. “A solitary child, neglected by his friends, is left there still.”\nScrooge said he knew it. And he sobbed.\nThey left the high-road, by a well-remembered lane, and soon approached a mansion of dull red brick, with a little weathercock-surmounted cupola, on the roof, and a bell hanging in it. It was a large house, but one of broken fortunes; for the spacious offices were little used, their walls were damp and mossy, their windows broken, and their gates decayed. Fowls clucked and strutted in the stables; and the coach-houses and sheds were over-run with grass. Nor was it more retentive of its ancient state, within; for entering the dreary hall, and glancing through the open doors of many rooms, they found them poorly furnished, cold, and vast. There was an earthy savour in the air, a chilly bareness in the place, which associated itself somehow with too much getting up by candle-light, and not too much to eat.\nThey went, the Ghost and Scrooge, across the hall, to a door at the back of the house. It opened before them, and disclosed a long, bare, melancholy room, made barer still by lines of plain deal forms and desks. At one of these a lonely boy was reading near a feeble fire; and Scrooge sat down upon a form, and wept to see his poor forgotten self as he used to be.\nNot a latent echo in the house, not a squeak and scuffle from the mice behind the panelling, not a drip from the half-thawed water-spout in the dull yard behind, not a sigh among the leafless boughs of one despondent poplar, not the idle swinging of an empty store-house door, no, not a clicking in the fire, but fell upon the heart of Scrooge with a softening influence, and gave a freer passage to his tears.\nThe Spirit touched him on the arm, and pointed to his younger self, intent upon his reading. Suddenly a man, in foreign garments: wonderfully real and distinct to look at: stood outside the window, with an axe stuck in his belt, and leading by the bridle an ass laden with wood.\n“Why, it’s Ali Baba!” Scrooge exclaimed in ecstasy. “It’s dear old honest Ali Baba! Yes, yes, I know! One Christmas time, when yonder solitary child was left here all alone, he did come, for the first time, just like that. Poor boy! And Valentine,” said Scrooge, “and his wild brother, Orson; there they go! And what’s his name, who was put down in his drawers, asleep, at the Gate of Damascus; don’t you see him! And the Sultan’s Groom turned upside down by the Genii; there he is upon his head! Serve him right. I’m glad of it. What business had he to be married to the Princess!”\nTo hear Scrooge expending all the earnestness of his nature on such subjects, in a most extraordinary voice between laughing and crying; and to see his heightened and excited face; would have been a surprise to his business friends in the city, indeed.\n“There’s the Parrot!” cried Scrooge. “Green body and yellow tail, with a thing like a lettuce growing out of the top of his head; there he is! Poor Robin Crusoe, he called him, when he came home again after sailing round the island. ‘Poor Robin Crusoe, where have you been, Robin Crusoe?’ The man thought he was dreaming, but he wasn’t. It was the Parrot, you know. There goes Friday, running for his life to the little creek! Halloa! Hoop! Halloo!”\nThen, with a rapidity of transition very foreign to his usual character, he said, in pity for his former self, “Poor boy!” and cried again.\n“I wish,” Scrooge muttered, putting his hand in his pocket, and looking about him, after drying his eyes with his cuff: “but it’s too late now.”\n“What is the matter?” asked the Spirit.\n“Nothing,” said Scrooge. “Nothing. There was a boy singing a Christmas Carol at my door last night. I should like to have given him something: that’s all.”",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "Scrooge’s protests that it was unsuitable for walking, that his bed was warm, the temperature freezing, he was only in his nightclothes, and had a cold, were useless.

Scrooge stood up, but seeing the Spirit heading for the window, he clutched its robe in fear. “I’m a mortal and could fall,” Scrooge argued. “Just accept a touch of my hand here,” the Spirit said, placing it on Scrooge’s heart, “and you’ll be supported in more than this.” As these words were spoken, they went through the wall and found themselves on an open country road flanked by fields. The city was completely gone. The darkness and fog had also vanished, replaced by a clear, cold, snowy winter day. “Good Heavens!” Scrooge exclaimed, clasping his hands and looking around. “I grew up here. I was a boy in this spot!” The Spirit looked at him kindly. Its touch, brief and light as it had been, seemed to linger for Scrooge. He smelled countless scents in the air, each triggering thousands of long-forgotten memories, hopes, joys, and worries. “Your lip is trembling,” the Ghost observed. “And what is on your cheek?” Scrooge mumbled, his voice unusually unsteady, that it was a blemish, and asked the Ghost to lead him wherever it wished. “Do you remember the way?” the Spirit inquired. “Remember it!” Scrooge cried enthusiastically, “I could find it blindfolded.” “Strange to have forgotten it for so many years!” the Ghost remarked. “Let’s continue.” They walked along the road, with Scrooge recognizing every gate, fence post, and tree, until a small market town appeared in the distance, complete with its bridge, church, and winding river. Soon, shaggy ponies ridden by boys came trotting towards them, calling out to other boys in country carts driven by farmers. All these boys were in high spirits, shouting to each other so merrily that the crisp air seemed to echo their joy. “These are merely reflections of the past,” the Ghost explained. “They are not aware of us.” The cheerful travelers approached, and as they did, Scrooge recognized and named every one of them. Why was he overjoyed beyond measure to see them? Why did his usually cold eyes sparkle, and his heart leap as they passed? Why was he filled with happiness hearing them wish each other ‘Merry Christmas’ as they went their separate ways? What did ‘Merry Christmas’ mean to Scrooge? Ridiculous ‘Merry Christmas’! What good had it ever done for him? “The school isn’t entirely empty,” the Ghost said. “A solitary child, neglected by his friends, is still there.” Scrooge confirmed he knew this and began to sob. They left the main road via a familiar lane and soon neared a rather drab red-brick mansion, topped with a small cupola featuring a weathercock and a bell. It was a large house but showed signs of decline; the spacious offices were little used, their walls damp and mossy, windows broken, and gates crumbling. Chickens pecked and strutted in the stables, and grass had overtaken the coach-houses and sheds. Inside, it was no better preserved; upon entering the gloomy hall and looking into the many rooms through open doors, they found them sparsely furnished, cold, and vast. The air had an earthy smell, a chilly emptiness that seemed linked to too many early mornings by candlelight and not enough food. The Ghost and Scrooge crossed the hall to a door at the back, which opened on its own to reveal a long, bare, depressing room, made more desolate by rows of simple wooden desks and benches. At one of these, a lonely boy was reading by a weak fire; Scrooge sat down on a bench and wept at the sight of his poor, overlooked past self. Every faint sound in the house—not a mouse’s squeak, not a drip from the half-thawed gutter in the gloomy yard, not a rustle in the leafless branches of a lonely poplar, not the creak of an empty store-room door, no, not even a flicker in the fire—failed to move Scrooge without having a softening effect, easing the flow of his tears. The Spirit touched his arm and indicated his younger self, absorbed in reading. Suddenly, a man in foreign clothes, looking remarkably real and distinct, stood outside the window. He had an axe in his belt and was leading a wood-laden donkey. “Why, it’s Ali Baba!” Scrooge cried in delight. “It’s dear, honest old Ali Baba! Yes, yes, I remember! One Christmas, when that solitary child was left here all alone, he did come, just like that, for the first time. Poor boy! And Valentine,” Scrooge continued, “and his wild brother, Orson; there they are! And what’s-his-name, who was put to bed in his underclothes, asleep, at the Gate of Damascus; can’t you see him! And the Sultan’s Groom turned upside down by the Genii; there he is, standing on his head! Served him right. I’m glad. What business did he have marrying the Princess!” To hear Scrooge pouring out such passionate feelings about these topics in an extraordinary voice that was a mix of laughter and tears, and to see his flushed and excited face, would truly have astonished his business acquaintances in the city. “There’s the Parrot!” Scrooge shouted. “Green body and yellow tail, with a thing like a lettuce growing out of his head; there he is! Poor Robin Crusoe, he called him, when he came back after sailing around the island. ‘Poor Robin Crusoe, where have you been, Robin Crusoe?’ The man thought he was dreaming, but he wasn’t. It was the Parrot, you know. There goes Friday, running for his life towards the little creek! Halloa! Hoop! Halloo!” Then, with an abrupt shift uncharacteristic of him, he said with pity for his younger self, “Poor boy!” and wept again. “I wish,” Scrooge muttered, putting his hand in his pocket and looking around after wiping his eyes with his cuff, “but it’s too late now.” “What is the matter?” the Spirit asked. “Nothing,” Scrooge replied. “Nothing. There was a boy singing a Christmas Carol at my door last night. I wish I had given him something: that’s all.”",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "Scrooge would have found it pointless to try to argue that the weather and time were unsuitable for a walk, that his bed was warm while the temperature outside was freezing, that he was only lightly dressed in his slippers, gown, and nightcap, and that he was suffering from a cold. The grip on him, though as gentle as a woman's touch, was unyielding. He stood up, and seeing that the Spirit was moving toward the window, he grabbed its robe in fear.\n\n\"I'm only human,\" Scrooge protested, \"and I could fall.\"\n\n\"Just touch my hand here,\" the Spirit said, placing it over Scrooge's heart, \"and you'll be safe from even worse things.\"\n\nImmediately after these words, they passed through the wall and found themselves standing on a country road surrounded by fields. The city had disappeared, along with the darkness and fog, replaced by a clear, cold winter's day with snow on the ground.\n\n\"Good heavens!\" Scrooge exclaimed, looking around and clasping his hands. \"I grew up here. I was a boy in this place!\"\n\nThe Spirit looked at him kindly. Though the Spirit's touch had been fleeting, Scrooge could still feel it. Memories and scents from long ago filled the air, bringing back long-forgotten hopes, joys, and cares.\n\n\"Your lip is trembling,\" said the Ghost. \"What's that on your cheek?\"\n\nScrooge, his voice unsteady, claimed it was just a pimple, and asked the Spirit to guide him onward.\n\n\"Do you remember the way?\" the Spirit asked.\n\n\"Remember it!\" Scrooge cried passionately. \"I could walk it with my eyes closed.\"\n\n\"It's strange you've forgotten it for so many years!\" commented the Ghost. \"Let's continue.\"\n\nThey walked along the road, Scrooge recognizing every gate, post, and tree, until they saw a small market town in the distance with a bridge, church, and winding river. Ponies with boys riding on their backs trotted past, calling to other boys in carts driven by farmers. The boys were all happy, shouting and laughing, filling the crisp air with joyous sounds.\n\n\"They are just shadows of the past,\" the Ghost explained. \"They can't see or hear us.\"\n\nAs the travelers passed, Scrooge knew and named every one of them. He was overcome with happiness as he watched them, his heart leaping at the sound of their cheerful Christmas greetings as they parted ways for their homes. But what had Christmas ever done for Scrooge, he wondered? Nothing good, as far as he could remember.\n\n\"The school isn't totally empty,\" said the Ghost. \"There's still a lonely child left behind, neglected by his friends.\"\n\nScrooge answered that he remembered, and broke down in tears.\n\nThey left the main road, went down a familiar lane, and soon arrived at a large, somewhat run-down red brick house with a cupola and old bell on the roof. The grounds were neglected, with birds wandering the stables and weeds growing everywhere. Inside, the house was poorly furnished, cold, and vast, with a chilly, barren feeling that reminded one of early mornings by candlelight and not enough food.\n\nThe Spirit and Scrooge crossed the gloomy hall to a door at the back, which opened to reveal a long, bare, sorrowful room: a dreary classroom with rows of desks. There, a lonely boy sat by a small fire, reading. Scrooge sat nearby and wept to see his forgotten younger self.\n\nEvery sound in the house—the creaks, the mice, the dripping water, the wind in the trees, the swinging door, even the fire—touched Scrooge's heart and brought more tears to his eyes.\n\nThe Spirit gently pointed at the young Scrooge, absorbed in his book. Suddenly, a man in exotic clothes appeared at the window, with an axe at his belt and leading a donkey loaded with wood.\n\n\"Why, that's Ali Baba!\" Scrooge said joyfully. \"Dear old Ali Baba! Yes, I remember—one Christmas when that lonely boy was left all alone, he came just like that. Poor boy! And there are Valentine and his wild brother Orson; and the man who fell asleep at the gate of Damascus; and the Sultan's Groom, flipped upside down by the genies—serves him right, marrying the Princess!\"\n\nScrooge spoke with such excitement and emotion—both laughing and crying—that anyone who knew him from his business life would have been astonished.\n\n\"There’s the Parrot! Green body and yellow tail, with something like a lettuce on his head—that’s him! Poor Robinson Crusoe, that’s what he called him when he came home after sailing around the island. ‘Poor Robin Crusoe, where have you been?’ The man thought he was dreaming, but it was the Parrot. And there’s Friday, running for his life to the creek!\"\n\nThen, quickly changing tone, Scrooge pitied his younger self. \"Poor boy!\" he said and began to cry again.\n\n\"I wish,\" Scrooge muttered, wiping his eyes with his sleeve and fumbling in his pocket, \"but it’s too late now.\"\n\n\"What’s wrong?\" asked the Spirit.\n\n\"Nothing,\" Scrooge replied. \"Nothing. A boy was singing a Christmas carol at my door last night. I wish I’d given him something. That’s all.\""

          "text_segment": "The Ghost smiled thoughtfully, and waved its hand: saying as it did so, “Let us see another Christmas!”\nScrooge’s former self grew larger at the words, and the room became a little darker and more dirty. The panels shrunk, the windows cracked; fragments of plaster fell out of the ceiling, and the naked laths were shown instead; but how all this was brought about, Scrooge knew no more than you do. He only knew that it was quite correct; that everything had happened so; that there he was, alone again, when all the other boys had gone home for the jolly holidays.\nHe was not reading now, but walking up and down despairingly. Scrooge looked at the Ghost, and with a mournful shaking of his head, glanced anxiously towards the door.\nIt opened; and a little girl, much younger than the boy, came darting in, and putting her arms about his neck, and often kissing him, addressed him as her “Dear, dear brother.”\n“I have come to bring you home, dear brother!” said the child, clapping her tiny hands, and bending down to laugh. “To bring you home, home, home!”\n“Home, little Fan?” returned the boy.\n“Yes!” said the child, brimful of glee. “Home, for good and all. Home, for ever and ever. Father is so much kinder than he used to be, that home’s like Heaven! He spoke so gently to me one dear night when I was going to bed, that I was not afraid to ask him once more if you might come home; and he said Yes, you should; and sent me in a coach to bring you. And you’re to be a man!” said the child, opening her eyes, “and are never to come back here; but first, we’re to be together all the Christmas long, and have the merriest time in all the world.”\n“You are quite a woman, little Fan!” exclaimed the boy.\nShe clapped her hands and laughed, and tried to touch his head; but being too little, laughed again, and stood on tiptoe to embrace him. Then she began to drag him, in her childish eagerness, towards the door; and he, nothing loth to go, accompanied her.\nA terrible voice in the hall cried, “Bring down Master Scrooge’s box, there!” and in the hall appeared the schoolmaster himself, who glared on Master Scrooge with a ferocious condescension, and threw him into a dreadful state of mind by shaking hands with him. He then conveyed him and his sister into the veriest old well of a shivering best-parlour that ever was seen, where the maps upon the wall, and the celestial and terrestrial globes in the windows, were waxy with cold. Here he produced a decanter of curiously light wine, and a block of curiously heavy cake, and administered instalments of those dainties to the young people: at the same time, sending out a meagre servant to offer a glass of “something” to the postboy, who answered that he thanked the gentleman, but if it was the same tap as he had tasted before, he had rather not. Master Scrooge’s trunk being by this time tied on to the top of the chaise, the children bade the schoolmaster good-bye right willingly; and getting into it, drove gaily down the garden-sweep: the quick wheels dashing the hoar-frost and snow from off the dark leaves of the evergreens like spray.\n“Always a delicate creature, whom a breath might have withered,” said the Ghost. “But she had a large heart!”\n“So she had,” cried Scrooge. “You’re right. I will not gainsay it, Spirit. God forbid!”\n“She died a woman,” said the Ghost, “and had, as I think, children.”\n“One child,” Scrooge returned.\n“True,” said the Ghost. “Your nephew!”\nScrooge seemed uneasy in his mind; and answered briefly, “Yes.”",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "The Ghost smiled thoughtfully, then gestured with its hand and suggested, \"Let's witness another Christmas!\" At these words, the younger version of Scrooge seemed to grow larger, and the appearance of the room deteriorated, becoming dimmer and dirtier. The wooden panels seemed to shrink, the windows developed cracks, pieces of plaster fell from the ceiling revealing the bare wooden beams underneath. Scrooge didn't understand how these changes happened, just as you wouldn't. He only knew they felt real and accurate, as if that's truly how it had been. There he was again, isolated, while all the other boys had left to spend the cheerful holidays at home.\nInstead of reading, he was now pacing back and forth in despair. Scrooge looked at the Ghost, shook his head sadly, and glanced nervously towards the door.\nIt opened, and a small girl, significantly younger than the boy, rushed in. She wrapped her arms around his neck, kissing him repeatedly, calling him her \"Dearest brother.\"\nThe child exclaimed, her tiny hands clapping as she bent down to laugh, \"I've come to take you home, dear brother! To take you home, home, home!\"\n\"Home, little Fan?\" the boy replied.\n\"Yes!\" the child burst out, full of joy. \"Home, permanently. Home, forever and ever. Father is so much kinder now than he used to be, that home feels like paradise! He spoke to me so gently one special night before I went to sleep, that I wasn't scared to ask him again if you could return home; and he said yes, you absolutely should; and sent a carriage just to bring you. And you're going to be a man!\" the child declared, eyes wide open, \"and you'll never have to come back here; but first, we're going to spend the entire Christmas together and have the most wonderful time in the world.\"\n\"You've really grown up, little Fan!\" the boy exclaimed.\nShe clapped and laughed again, attempting to touch his head but being too short. Laughing again, she stood on tiptoe to hug him. Then, with childish eagerness, she began to pull him towards the door, and he followed willingly.\nA loud, stern voice from the hall shouted, \"Bring down Master Scrooge's trunk!\" and the schoolmaster himself appeared in the hall. He looked at Master Scrooge with a harsh, patronizing gaze and made him feel terrible by shaking his hand. He then led the boy and his sister into a very old, cold, shaking best-parlour, where the maps on the walls and the globes in the windows were dull and waxy from the cold. Here, he offered the young people servings from a decanter of unusually light wine and a block of unusually heavy cake. At the same time, he sent out a poorly dressed servant to offer a drink to the postboy, who replied that he was grateful but would prefer not if it was the same drink he had tasted before. By this time, Master Scrooge's trunk had been tied onto the top of the carriage, and the children eagerly said goodbye to the schoolmaster. Getting into the carriage, they drove cheerfully down the garden path, the fast wheels scattering the white frost and snow from the dark leaves of the evergreen bushes like water spray.\n\"She was always a delicate creature, easily affected, whom a single breath could have harmed,\" the Ghost commented. \"But she possessed a generous spirit!\"\n\"Indeed she did,\" Scrooge agreed. \"You are correct. I won't disagree with you, Spirit. Absolutely not!\"\n\"She died as a woman,\" the Ghost stated, \"and I believe she had children.\"\n\"One child,\" Scrooge corrected.\n\"True,\" the Ghost acknowledged. \"Your nephew!\"\nScrooge appeared troubled by this realization and replied simply, \"Yes.\"",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "The Ghost gave a gentle smile, gesturing with its hand and saying, 'Let us witness another Christmas.' At this, Scrooge saw his younger self appear older, while the room faded into a dimmer, more neglected state; the wood panels shrank, window panes broke, plaster crumbled from the ceiling to reveal the bare framework. Scrooge had no idea how such changes took place, only that it was accurate—he was left alone again at school when everyone else had gone home for the cheerful holidays.\n\nNo longer reading, young Scrooge paced the room in distress. Looking sadly toward the Ghost and then with worry at the door, he witnessed it open. A little girl, much younger than Scrooge, rushed in, hugged and kissed him excitedly, calling him 'Dear, dear brother.'\n\n'I’ve come to bring you home!' she exclaimed with delight, clapping her hands. 'Home for good—forever! Father has become kind, making home feel heavenly. He spoke so gently to me one night that I gathered courage to ask if you could return, and he agreed. He even sent me in a carriage to fetch you. And soon you’ll be a grown man, never to return here! But first, we’ll spend all Christmas together and have the happiest time.'\n\n'You’re quite the young lady, Fan!' the boy replied, as Fan laughed, tried to pat his head but couldn’t reach, then stood on tiptoe to embrace him. Eagerly, she pulled him toward the door, and he went with her willingly.\n\nA stern voice in the hallway called out for Scrooge’s box, and the schoolmaster appeared, looking at Scrooge with cold authority. The handshake unsettled Scrooge, and he and his sister were shown into a drafty old parlor, decorated with cold-to-the-touch globes and maps. The schoolmaster served some pale wine and substantial cake to the children, while a thin servant was sent to offer a drink to the coachman outside, who declined after his last experience. With Scrooge's luggage secured to the top of the carriage, the children happily said goodbye to the schoolmaster and cheerfully rode away, the wheels casting snow and frost from the garden evergreens like water spray.\n\n'Fan was always fragile, yet full of love,' noted the Ghost. 'Indeed she was,' agreed Scrooge, insisting he would not deny it. The Ghost remarked that Fan died as an adult and had children. 'She had one child,' Scrooge confirmed. 'Your nephew,' the Ghost concluded. Scrooge responded with unease, simply saying, 'Yes.'"

It was made plain enough, by the dressing of the shops, that here too it was Christmas time again; but it was evening, and the streets were lighted up.\nThe Ghost stopped at a certain warehouse door, and asked Scrooge if he knew it.\n“Know it!” said Scrooge. “Was I apprenticed here!”\nThey went in. At sight of an old gentleman in a Welsh wig, sitting behind such a high desk, that if he had been two inches taller he must have knocked his head against the ceiling, Scrooge cried in great excitement:\n“Why, it’s old Fezziwig! Bless his heart; it’s Fezziwig alive again!”\nOld Fezziwig laid down his pen, and looked up at the clock, which pointed to the hour of seven. He rubbed his hands; adjusted his capacious waistcoat; laughed all over himself, from his shoes to his organ of benevolence; and called out in a comfortable, oily, rich, fat, jovial voice:\n“Yo ho, there! Ebenezer! Dick!”\nScrooge’s former self, now grown a young man, came briskly in, accompanied by his fellow-’prentice.\n“Dick Wilkins, to be sure!” said Scrooge to the Ghost. “Bless me, yes. There he is. He was very much attached to me, was Dick. Poor Dick! Dear, dear!”\n“Yo ho, my boys!” said Fezziwig. “No more work to-night. Christmas Eve, Dick. Christmas, Ebenezer! Let’s have the shutters up,” cried old Fezziwig, with a sharp clap of his hands, “before a man can say Jack Robinson!”\nYou wouldn’t believe how those two fellows went at it! They charged into the street with the shutters—one, two, three—had ’em up in their places—four, five, six—barred ’em and pinned ’em—seven, eight, nine—and came back before you could have got to twelve, panting like race-horses.\n“Hilli-ho!” cried old Fezziwig, skipping down from the high desk, with wonderful agility. “Clear away, my lads, and let’s have lots of room here! Hilli-ho, Dick! Chirrup, Ebenezer!”\nClear away! There was nothing they wouldn’t have cleared away, or couldn’t have cleared away, with old Fezziwig looking on. It was done in a minute. Every movable was packed off, as if it were dismissed from public life for evermore; the floor was swept and watered, the lamps were trimmed, fuel was heaped upon the fire; and the warehouse was as snug, and warm, and dry, and bright a ball-room, as you would desire to see upon a winter’s night.\nIn came a fiddler with a music-book, and went up to the lofty desk, and made an orchestra of it, and tuned like fifty stomach-aches. In came Mrs. Fezziwig, one vast substantial smile. In came the three Miss Fezziwigs, beaming and lovable. In came the six young followers whose hearts they broke. In came all the young men and women employed in the business. In came the housemaid, with her cousin, the baker. In came the cook, with her brother’s particular friend, the milkman. In came the boy from over the way, who was suspected of not having board enough from his master; trying to hide himself behind the girl from next door but one, who was proved to have had her ears pulled by her mistress. In they all came, one after another; some shyly, some boldly, some gracefully, some awkwardly, some pushing, some pulling; in they all came, anyhow and everyhow. Away they all went, twenty couple at once; hands half round and back again the other way; down the middle and up again; round and round in various stages of affectionate grouping; old top couple always turning up in the wrong place; new top couple starting off again, as soon as they got there; all top couples at last, and not a bottom one to help them! When this result was brought about, old Fezziwig, clapping his hands to stop the dance, cried out, “Well done!” and the fiddler plunged his hot face into a pot of porter, especially provided for that purpose. But scorning rest, upon his reappearance, he instantly began again, though there were no dancers yet, as if the other fiddler had been carried home, exhausted, on a shutter, and he were a bran-new man resolved to beat him out of sight, or perish.\nThere were more dances, and there were forfeits, and more dances, and there was cake, and there was negus, and there was a great piece of Cold Roast, and there was a great piece of Cold Boiled, and there were mince-pies, and plenty of beer. But the great effect of the evening came after the Roast and Boiled, when the fiddler (an artful dog, mind! The sort of man who knew his business better than you or I could have told it him!) struck up “Sir Roger de Coverley.” Then old Fezziwig stood out to dance with Mrs. Fezziwig. Top couple, too; with a good stiff piece of work cut out for them; three or four and twenty pair of partners; people who were not to be trifled with; people who would dance, and had no notion of walking.\nBut if they had been twice as many—ah, four times—old Fezziwig would have been a match for them, and so would Mrs. Fezziwig. As to her, she was worthy to be his partner in every sense of the term. If that’s not high praise, tell me higher, and I’ll use it. A positive light appeared to issue from Fezziwig’s calves. They shone in every part of the dance like moons. You couldn’t have predicted, at any given time, what would have become of them next. And when old Fezziwig and Mrs. Fezziwig had gone all through the dance; advance and retire, both hands to your partner, bow and curtsey, corkscrew, thread-the-needle, and back again to your place; Fezziwig “cut”—cut so deftly, that he appeared to wink with his legs, and came upon his feet again without a stagger.\nWhen the clock struck eleven, this domestic ball broke up. Mr. and Mrs. Fezziwig took their stations, one on either side of the door, and shaking hands with every person individually as he or she went out, wished him or her a Merry Christmas. When everybody had retired but the two ’prentices, they did the same to them; and thus the cheerful voices died away, and the lads were left to their beds; which were under a counter in the back-shop.\nDuring the whole of this time, Scrooge had acted like a man out of his wits. His heart and soul were in the scene, and with his former self. He corroborated everything, remembered everything, enjoyed everything, and underwent the strangest agitation. It was not until now, when the bright faces of his former self and Dick were turned from them, that he remembered the Ghost, and became conscious that it was looking full upon him, while the light upon its head burnt very clear.\n“A small matter,” said the Ghost, “to make these silly folks so full of gratitude.”\n“Small!” echoed Scrooge.\nThe Spirit signed to him to listen to the two apprentices, who were pouring out their hearts in praise of Fezziwig: and when he had done so, said,\n“Why! Is it not? He has spent but a few pounds of your mortal money: three or four perhaps. Is that so much that he deserves this praise?”\n“It isn’t that,” said Scrooge, heated by the remark, and speaking unconsciously like his former, not his latter, self. “It isn’t that, Spirit. He has the power to render us happy or unhappy; to make our service light or burdensome; a pleasure or a toil. Say that his power lies in words and looks; in things so slight and insignificant that it is impossible to add and count ’em up: what then? The happiness he gives, is quite as great as if it cost a fortune.”\nHe felt the Spirit’s glance, and stopped.\n“What is the matter?” asked the Ghost.\n“Nothing particular,” said Scrooge.\n“Something, I think?” the Ghost insisted.\n“No,” said Scrooge, “No. I should like to be able to say a word or two to my clerk just now. That’s all.”",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "After leaving the school, they immediately found themselves in the bustling streets of a city. Here, indistinct people moved back and forth, and shadowy carts and carriages vied for space, creating the noise and chaos of a real urban centre. The decorations in the shop windows clearly showed it was Christmas time again, but since it was evening, the streets were illuminated.The Ghost paused at a particular warehouse entrance and asked Scrooge if he recognised it. “Of course!” Scrooge exclaimed. “This is where I served my apprenticeship!”They entered. Upon seeing an old gentleman in a Welsh wig seated behind a desk so tall he'd hit his head if he were slightly taller, Scrooge cried out in great excitement: “Why, it’s old Fezziwig! God bless him; Fezziwig, brought back to life!”Old Fezziwig set down his pen, glanced at the clock which showed seven o’clock. He rubbed his hands together, adjusted his large waistcoat, chuckled heartily from head to toe, and called out in a pleasant, cheerful, deep, portly voice: “Yo ho, boys! Ebenezer! Dick!”Scrooge's younger self, now a young man, hurried in along with his fellow apprentice. “Dick Wilkins, absolutely!” Scrooge said to the Ghost. “Yes, I remember him. There he is. Dick was very fond of me. Poor fellow! Oh dear, oh dear!”“Yo ho, my lads!” Fezziwig announced. “No more work tonight. It’s Christmas Eve, Dick. Christmas, Ebenezer! Let’s get those shutters up,” old Fezziwig cried, clapping his hands sharply, “in a flash!”You wouldn’t believe how quickly those two worked! They dashed outside with the shutters – one, two, three – got them in place – four, five, six – barred and secured them – seven, eight, nine – and were back inside before you could count to twelve, breathless from their effort. “Hilli-ho!” shouted old Fezziwig, leaping down from his high desk with surprising nimbleness. “Clear everything away, boys, let’s make plenty of room! Hilli-ho, Dick! Cheer up, Ebenezer!”Clear the room! There was nothing they wouldn’t or couldn’t clear away with old Fezziwig watching. It was done in under a minute. Everything portable was moved out of the way completely; the floor was swept and dampened, the lamps were brightened, more coal was added to the fire; and the warehouse became as comfortable, warm, dry, and brightly lit a place for dancing as you could hope to find on a winter night.A fiddler arrived with his music book, climbed onto the high desk, turning it into a stage, and tuned his instrument producing awful sounds. Then came Mrs. Fezziwig, a picture of beaming happiness. The three Miss Fezziwigs entered, radiant and charming. Following them were the six young men who were smitten with them. All the young men and women employed in the business came in. The housemaid arrived with her cousin, the baker. The cook came with her brother’s particular friend, the milkman. The boy from across the street, suspected of being underfed by his master, sneaked in, trying to hide behind the girl from next door but one, known for having her ears pulled by her mistress. They all entered, one after another, in every possible manner – some shyly, some confidently, some gracefully, some clumsily, some pushing, some pulling. Once everyone was in, the dancing began, twenty couples at a time. They performed various country dance figures, with the leading couple always ending up in the wrong spot, and the new leading couple starting as soon as they got there, until eventually, everyone was a leading couple, with nobody left at the bottom to assist! When this point was reached, old Fezziwig clapped his hands to halt the dance and cried, “Excellent work!” The fiddler immediately buried his flushed face in a pot of porter specifically provided for him. But ignoring any rest, he instantly started playing again as soon as he resurfaced, even though there were no dancers yet, as if the previous fiddler had been carried off, worn out, on a shutter, and he was a completely new man determined to outperform him or collapse trying.There were more dances, party games with forfeits, more dancing, and plenty of food and drink: cake, warm spiced wine, a large piece of cold roasted meat, a large piece of cold boiled meat, mince pies, and lots of beer. But the highlight of the evening came after the roast and boiled meats were served, when the fiddler (a cunning fellow, mind you! A man who understood his craft better than anyone could teach him!) began playing “Sir Roger de Coverley.” Old Fezziwig then stepped forward to dance with Mrs. Fezziwig. They were the lead couple, facing a challenging task with twenty-three or twenty-four pairs of partners; people who were serious about dancing and had no intention of merely walking through the steps.Yet, even if there had been twice as many people—or even four times—old Fezziwig would have been a match for them, and so would Mrs. Fezziwig. As for her, she was his perfect partner in every way. If that doesn't sound like high praise, tell me something better, and I'll use it. A distinct radiance seemed to emanate from Fezziwig’s legs below the knee. They were incredibly lively throughout the dance. You couldn't predict what they would do next at any moment. And after old Fezziwig and Mrs. Fezziwig completed the entire dance routine—advancing and retreating, joining hands, bowing and curtseying, performing complex figures like the corkscrew and threading the needle, and returning to their places—Fezziwig executed a “cut”—a step so skillful it looked like he was winking with his legs, landing back on his feet without a wobble.When the clock struck eleven, this cheerful home party ended. Mr. and Mrs. Fezziwig stood one on either side of the door, shaking hands with each person as they left, wishing them all a Merry Christmas. When everyone but the two apprentices had gone, they did the same for them; and so the happy voices faded away, and the young men were left to go to their beds, which were located under a counter in the back of the shop.During this entire time, Scrooge had been completely engrossed, as if he were out of his mind. His entire focus was on the scene and his past self. He confirmed everything, remembered everything, relished everything, and felt intensely emotional. Only now, as the happy faces of his younger self and Dick turned away from them, did he remember the Ghost, becoming aware that it was staring directly at him, its head radiating a clear light. “A trivial matter,” said the Ghost, “to make these simple people so incredibly grateful.”“Trivial!” Scrooge echoed, shocked.The Spirit gestured for him to listen to the two apprentices, who were enthusiastically praising Fezziwig. After Scrooge had listened, the Spirit said, “Indeed! Is it not? He only spent a small sum of your earthly money; perhaps three or four pounds. Is that really enough to earn such praise?”“That’s not the point,” Scrooge said, heated by the comment and speaking instinctively like his younger self, not his current self. “That’s not it, Spirit. He possessed the ability to make us happy or unhappy; to make our work feel light or heavy; a joy or a chore. Even if his power was just in his words and expressions, in things so small and insignificant that you couldn’t possibly measure them: what does that matter? The happiness he provided was just as significant as if it had cost him a fortune.”He sensed the Spirit’s gaze and fell silent. “What is wrong?” the Ghost asked. “Nothing in particular,” Scrooge replied. “Something, I believe?” the Ghost pressed. “No,” said Scrooge, “No. I simply wish I could say a word or two to my clerk right now. That’s all.”",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "Even though they had just left the school, they now found themselves in the bustling streets of a city, crowded with shadowy people and busy vehicles jostling for space—the city was alive with the energy and chaos that comes with real urban life. The festive shop decorations made it clear that it was Christmas yet again, and since it was evening, the streets were brightly lit.\n\nThe Ghost stopped at a warehouse door and asked Scrooge if he recognized it. Scrooge exclaimed that he certainly did, as this was where he’d been an apprentice. Once inside, they saw an elderly man in a Welsh wig sitting behind a desk so high that if he were any taller, he’d have hit his head on the ceiling. Scrooge was thrilled—he recognized Mr. Fezziwig and expressed his delight at seeing him again, alive and well.\n\nMr. Fezziwig put down his pen, glanced up at the clock showing seven o’clock, rubbed his hands, adjusted his large waistcoat, laughed heartily, and called out merrily for Ebenezer and Dick, his apprentices. Young Scrooge, along with his fellow apprentice Dick Wilkins, entered energetically. Scrooge told the Ghost how fond Dick had been of him, lamenting affectionately.\n\nMr. Fezziwig cheerfully declared the work day over in honor of Christmas Eve and ordered them to put up the shutters on the windows, challenging them to do it quickly. The two apprentices rushed outside with the shutters, putting them up and securing them in no time, returning as breathless as racehorses. Fezziwig then eagerly leapt down from his desk and told the boys to clear away the warehouse to make space for festivities, which they did swiftly under his supervision, packing away every movable object and making the warehouse as clean, cozy, and festive as possible, ready for a ball.\n\nA fiddler soon arrived, set up his spot and tuned vigorously. Then Mrs. Fezziwig entered, radiating happiness, accompanied by her three cheerful daughters and their young admirers. All the employees, the housemaid and her cousin the baker, the cook with the milkman, and even a neighbor boy and girl arrived, joining in—everyone came, no matter their manner. The dancing began with groups twirling, pairing off, moving energetically through the steps, everyone swapping partners and positions, all having a wonderful time. When the final, chaotic round of the dance ended, Fezziwig applauded, and the fiddler paused only briefly to drink before beginning another tune as if energized by the challenge.\n\nThe party continued with more dancing, forfeits, delicious food like roast and boiled meats, mince pies, cake, plenty of beer and negus. But the highlight was when the fiddler played \"Sir Roger de Coverley\" and Fezziwig led a dance with his wife—both matching each other in spirit and skill, outshining everyone else. Fezziwig was especially lively, his legs moving so impressively in the dance that they seemed to shine, and he finished with a stunning flourish.\n\nAt eleven, the celebration ended. Mr. and Mrs. Fezziwig stood by the door, shaking hands and wishing every guest a Merry Christmas. When only the apprentices were left, they too wished them well before everyone retired for the night, with the young men going to their beds under a counter in the back shop.\n\nThroughout all this, Scrooge was deeply moved—fully present in the scene, recalling everything with joy and emotion. He didn’t notice the Ghost until the party faded, at which point the Ghost watched him closely, its head shining brightly.\n\nThe Ghost commented on how little it took to make people so grateful. Scrooge, stirred, replied defensively that it wasn’t about the money—it was about Fezziwig’s ability to make his workers’ lives happy or miserable with the way he treated them. The happiness Fezziwig gave was worth as much as if it had cost a fortune, regardless of the small actual expense.\n\nFeeling the Ghost’s gaze, Scrooge quieted. When asked what was wrong, Scrooge hesitated, but finally admitted that he wished he could say a kind word to his own clerk at that moment."

For again Scrooge saw himself. He was older now; a man in the prime of life. His face had not the harsh and rigid lines of later years; but it had begun to wear the signs of care and avarice. There was an eager, greedy, restless motion in the eye, which showed the passion that had taken root, and where the shadow of the growing tree would fall.\nHe was not alone, but sat by the side of a fair young girl in a mourning-dress: in whose eyes there were tears, which sparkled in the light that shone out of the Ghost of Christmas Past.\n“It matters little,” she said, softly. “To you, very little. Another idol has displaced me; and if it can cheer and comfort you in time to come, as I would have tried to do, I have no just cause to grieve.”\n“What Idol has displaced you?” he rejoined.\n“A golden one.”\n“This is the even-handed dealing of the world!” he said. “There is nothing on which it is so hard as poverty; and there is nothing it professes to condemn with such severity as the pursuit of wealth!”\n“You fear the world too much,” she answered, gently. “All your other hopes have merged into the hope of being beyond the chance of its sordid reproach. I have seen your nobler aspirations fall off one by one, until the master-passion, Gain, engrosses you. Have I not?”\n“What then?” he retorted. “Even if I have grown so much wiser, what then? I am not changed towards you.”\nShe shook her head.\n“Am I?”\n“Our contract is an old one. It was made when we were both poor and content to be so, until, in good season, we could improve our worldly fortune by our patient industry. You are changed. When it was made, you were another man.”\n“I was a boy,” he said impatiently.\n“Your own feeling tells you that you were not what you are,” she returned. “I am. That which promised happiness when we were one in heart, is fraught with misery now that we are two. How often and how keenly I have thought of this, I will not say. It is enough that I have thought of it, and can release you.”\n“Have I ever sought release?”\n“In words. No. Never.”\n“In what, then?”\n“In a changed nature; in an altered spirit; in another atmosphere of life; another Hope as its great end. In everything that made my love of any worth or value in your sight. If this had never been between us,” said the girl, looking mildly, but with steadiness, upon him; “tell me, would you seek me out and try to win me now? Ah, no!”\nHe seemed to yield to the justice of this supposition, in spite of himself. But he said with a struggle, “You think not.”\n“I would gladly think otherwise if I could,” she answered, “Heaven knows! When I have learned a Truth like this, I know how strong and irresistible it must be. But if you were free to-day, to-morrow, yesterday, can even I believe that you would choose a dowerless girl—you who, in your very confidence with her, weigh everything by Gain: or, choosing her, if for a moment you were false enough to your one guiding principle to do so, do I not know that your repentance and regret would surely follow? I do; and I release you. With a full heart, for the love of him you once were.”\nHe was about to speak; but with her head turned from him, she resumed.\n“You may—the memory of what is past half makes me hope you will—have pain in this. A very, very brief time, and you will dismiss the recollection of it, gladly, as an unprofitable dream, from which it happened well that you awoke. May you be happy in the life you have chosen!”\nShe left him, and they parted.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "As his past self turned down the lights after making his wish, Scrooge and the Ghost were once again standing outside. “My time is almost up,” the Spirit noted. “Hurry!” This urgent command wasn't directed at Scrooge or anyone visible, but it had an immediate effect. Scrooge again saw himself, but older this time, in the prime of his life. His face hadn't yet developed the harsh, severe lines of his later years, but it was beginning to show signs of worry and greed. There was an anxious, grasping, restless look in his eyes, revealing the growing obsession and hinting at its future dominance. He wasn't alone; he sat next to a lovely young woman in a mourning dress. Tears were visible in her eyes, reflecting the light cast by the Ghost of Christmas Past. “It’s not very important,” she said softly. “To you, it’s quite insignificant. Something else has taken my place as your idol; and if it can bring you happiness and comfort in the future, as I would have tried to do, I have no valid reason to be sad.” “What idol has taken my place?” he asked in return. “A golden one,” she replied. “This is the world’s idea of fairness!” he exclaimed. “Nothing is as harsh on poverty, and nothing does it pretend to condemn so strongly as the pursuit of wealth!” “You are too afraid of the world,” she answered gently. “All your other hopes have been absorbed into the hope of escaping its shameful disapproval. I’ve watched your nobler ambitions fade away, one by one, until your overriding passion, profit, consumes you completely. Isn’t that true?” “What if it is?” he retorted. “Even if I’ve become so much more sensible, what difference does it make? My feelings towards you haven’t changed.” She shook her head. “Haven’t I?” he pressed. “Our agreement is an old one. We made it when we were both poor and happy to be so, planning to improve our circumstances in good time through patient hard work. You *have* changed. When we made that promise, you were a different person.” “I was a boy,” he said impatiently. “Your own feelings tell you that you are not the man you once were,” she countered. “I am. What promised happiness when we were united in heart now brings sorrow because we are divided. I won't say how often and how deeply I have thought about this. It is enough that I *have* thought about it and can release you.” “Have I ever asked to be released?” “In words? No. Never.” “How then?” “Through a changed character; through an altered spirit; through a different way of living; through a different goal as your ultimate aim. In everything that stripped my love of any worth or value in your eyes. If none of this had ever been between us,” the girl said, looking at him gently but steadily, “tell me, would you seek me out and try to win me over now? Oh, no!” He seemed to silently acknowledge the truth of this assumption, despite his reluctance. But he said with difficulty, “You think not.” “Heaven knows, I would gladly think differently if I could,” she replied. “When I have faced a truth like this, I know how powerful and undeniable it must be. But even if you were free today, tomorrow, yesterday, could I truly believe that you would choose a girl without a dowry—you who, even when being open with her, weigh everything based on profit? Or, if you did choose her, if only for a moment you were disloyal enough to your main principle to do so, don't I know that regret and remorse would surely follow? I do; and I release you. I do so with a heavy heart, for the sake of the man you used to be.” He was about to reply, but she turned her head away from him and continued. “You may—and the memory of the past gives me a little hope you will—feel pain from this. But very, very soon, you will gladly dismiss the memory of it as an unprofitable dream from which it was good that you awoke.

Scrooge now saw himself as an adult, still not yet hardened by old age, but with care and greed beginning to show on his face, and an intense, restless look in his eyes hinting at an obsession with wealth taking hold. He was seated next to a beautiful young woman in mourning attire, her eyes shining with tears reflecting the Ghost’s light. She spoke softly: “It doesn’t matter much—to you, it matters very little. Something else has taken my place; if it brings you the happiness I hoped to give, I have no right to mourn it.”\n\n“What has replaced you?” he asked.\n\n“Gold,” she replied.\n\n“This is how the world works!” he protested. “Poverty is difficult, but everyone pretends to condemn the pursuit of wealth even more!”\n\n“You’re too influenced by what the world thinks,” she gently answered. “Your old hopes have all merged into your wish to escape poverty and criticism. I’ve seen your better dreams fade until your only passion is for Gain. Isn’t that true?”\n\n“So what?” he replied. “Even if I have become wiser, I haven’t changed my feelings toward you.”\n\nShe shook her head. “Am I not changed?”\n\n“Our promise was made long ago when we were both poor but happy to be so, waiting for a better life through hard work. You’ve changed. When we made that promise, you were different.”\n\n“I was a boy then,” he replied impatiently.\n\n“You know in your heart you’re not the same,” she returned. “What once promised happiness now brings pain, because we’ve grown apart. I won’t say how often I’ve thought about this. It’s enough that I have, and I can release you.”\n\n“Did I ever ask for release?”\n\n“Not in words—never.”\n\n“How, then?”\n\n“In your changed nature; in your spirit; in the new goals that have replaced what once made my love precious to you. If nothing had come between us,” she looked steadily at him, “tell me honestly, would you seek me out and want me now? No, you wouldn’t.”\n\nHe seemed to agree, though reluctantly. “You believe that?”\n\n“I wish I could believe otherwise,” she said. “But when I see this truth, I know it can’t be denied. Even if you were free now or at any time, could I believe you’d choose a poor girl—you who value everything by profit? Or, if you did choose me against your nature, don’t I know that you would regret it? I do, and so I release you, with love for the man you once were.”\n\nHe was about to reply, but she turned away and continued. “Maybe the memory of our past will hurt you for a short while, but soon you’ll forget it as just a useless dream. I hope you’ll be happy in the life you’ve chosen.”\n\nShe walked away, and they separated."

I don’t wish to see it. Show me no more!”\nBut the relentless Ghost pinioned him in both his arms, and forced him to observe what happened next.\nThey were in another scene and place; a room, not very large or handsome, but full of comfort. Near to the winter fire sat a beautiful young girl, so like that last that Scrooge believed it was the same, until he saw her, now a comely matron, sitting opposite her daughter. The noise in this room was perfectly tumultuous, for there were more children there, than Scrooge in his agitated state of mind could count; and, unlike the celebrated herd in the poem, they were not forty children conducting themselves like one, but every child was conducting itself like forty. The consequences were uproarious beyond belief; but no one seemed to care; on the contrary, the mother and daughter laughed heartily, and enjoyed it very much; and the latter, soon beginning to mingle in the sports, got pillaged by the young brigands most ruthlessly. What would I not have given to be one of them! Though I never could have been so rude, no, no! I wouldn’t for the wealth of all the world have crushed that braided hair, and torn it down; and for the precious little shoe, I wouldn’t have plucked it off, God bless my soul! to save my life. As to measuring her waist in sport, as they did, bold young brood, I couldn’t have done it; I should have expected my arm to have grown round it for a punishment, and never come straight again. And yet I should have dearly liked, I own, to have touched her lips; to have questioned her, that she might have opened them; to have looked upon the lashes of her downcast eyes, and never raised a blush; to have let loose waves of hair, an inch of which would be a keepsake beyond price: in short, I should have liked, I do confess, to have had the lightest licence of a child, and yet to have been man enough to know its value.\nBut now a knocking at the door was heard, and such a rush immediately ensued that she with laughing face and plundered dress was borne towards it the centre of a flushed and boisterous group, just in time to greet the father, who came home attended by a man laden with Christmas toys and presents. Then the shouting and the struggling, and the onslaught that was made on the defenceless porter! The scaling him with chairs for ladders to dive into his pockets, despoil him of brown-paper parcels, hold on tight by his cravat, hug him round his neck, pommel his back, and kick his legs in irrepressible affection! The shouts of wonder and delight with which the development of every package was received! The terrible announcement that the baby had been taken in the act of putting a doll’s frying-pan into his mouth, and was more than suspected of having swallowed a fictitious turkey, glued on a wooden platter! The immense relief of finding this a false alarm! The joy, and gratitude, and ecstasy! They are all indescribable alike. It is enough that by degrees the children and their emotions got out of the parlour, and by one stair at a time, up to the top of the house; where they went to bed, and so subsided.\nAnd now Scrooge looked on more attentively than ever, when the master of the house, having his daughter leaning fondly on him, sat down with her and her mother at his own fireside; and when he thought that such another creature, quite as graceful and as full of promise, might have called him father, and been a spring-time in the haggard winter of his life, his sight grew very dim indeed.\n“Belle,” said the husband, turning to his wife with a smile, “I saw an old friend of yours this afternoon.”\n“Who was it?”\n“Guess!”\n“How can I? Tut, don’t I know?” she added in the same breath, laughing as he laughed. “Mr. Scrooge.”\n“Mr. Scrooge it was. I passed his office window; and as it was not shut up, and he had a candle inside, I could scarcely help seeing him. His partner lies upon the point of death, I hear; and there he sat alone. Quite alone in the world, I do believe.”\n“Spirit!” said Scrooge in a broken voice, “remove me from this place.”\n“I told you these were shadows of the things that have been,” said the Ghost. “That they are what they are, do not blame me!”\n“Remove me!” Scrooge exclaimed, “I cannot bear it!”\nHe turned upon the Ghost, and seeing that it looked upon him with a face, in which in some strange way there were fragments of all the faces it had shown him, wrestled with it.\n“Leave me! Take me back. Haunt me no longer!”\nIn the struggle, if that can be called a struggle in which the Ghost with no visible resistance on its own part was undisturbed by any effort of its adversary, Scrooge observed that its light was burning high and bright; and dimly connecting that with its influence over him, he seized the extinguisher-cap, and by a sudden action pressed it down upon its head.\nThe Spirit dropped beneath it, so that the extinguisher covered its whole form; but though Scrooge pressed it down with all his force, he could not hide the light: which streamed from under it, in an unbroken flood upon the ground.\nHe was conscious of being exhausted, and overcome by an irresistible drowsiness; and, further, of being in his own bedroom. He gave the cap a parting squeeze, in which his hand relaxed; and had barely time to reel to bed, before he sank into a heavy sleep.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "Scrooge pleaded with the Spirit to stop showing him things and take him back home, asking why it seemed to enjoy his pain. The Ghost replied there was just \"one more shadow\" to see. Scrooge adamantly refused, crying out that he didn't want to witness anything further. But the persistent Spirit held him fast by both arms, forcing him to watch what came next. They found themselves in a different location and scene: a comfortable, though not spacious or fancy, room. Near the fire sat a lovely young woman, so similar to the one from the previous vision that Scrooge initially thought it was the same person, until he saw an attractive, mature woman, clearly her mother, seated opposite her daughter. The room was incredibly noisy, filled with more children than Scrooge, in his agitated state, could count. Unlike a well-behaved group, each child was acting with the energy of many, creating an unbelievable uproar. Yet, no one seemed bothered; in fact, the mother and daughter laughed heartily and greatly enjoyed it. The daughter soon joined the games, being playfully overwhelmed and 'pillaged' by the energetic children. Scrooge reflected internally on how much he would have given to be part of that lively scene, though he knew he could never have been so wild. He swore he wouldn't have harmed the girl's braided hair or taken her precious shoe for anything in the world, not even to save his life. He couldn't have dared to playfully measure her waist as the bold children did, feeling his arm would be punished by staying wrapped around her forever. Yet, he confessed he would have loved to gently touch her lips, perhaps ask a question to hear her speak, look at her lowered eyes without making her blush, and release her flowing hair, a single inch of which would be a priceless keepsake. He longed for the innocent freedom of a child in that moment, while still appreciating its immense value as an adult. Suddenly, a knock was heard at the door. A rush of children immediately followed, carrying the daughter, laughing and with her dress slightly messy, to the door in the center of the excited crowd. They arrived just as her father came home, accompanied by a man loaded down with Christmas toys and presents. What followed was a flurry of shouts, struggles, and a joyful assault on the helpless man with the gifts! The children used chairs as ladders to climb him, trying to empty his pockets, snatch brown-paper parcels, grab his tie, hug his neck, playfully hit his back, and kick his legs out of sheer affection! The shouts of wonder and delight as each package was opened were immense! There was a dramatic announcement that the baby had been caught trying to eat a toy frying pan and was suspected of having swallowed a pretend turkey glued to a plate! The huge relief when it turned out to be a false alarm was palpable! The joy, gratitude, and sheer happiness are all impossible to describe. Gradually, the children and their excitement moved out of the living room, going upstairs one step at a time, until they reached the top floor where they finally settled down to sleep. Scrooge watched more intently than ever as the father, with his daughter leaning lovingly on him, sat down with her and his wife by the fire. Thinking that a person so graceful and promising could have been his daughter, bringing springtime into his bleak, lonely life, his vision grew very blurry. The husband smiled and turned to his wife, saying, \"Belle, I saw an old friend of yours this afternoon.\" When she asked who, he told her to guess. Laughing, she immediately guessed, \"Mr. Scrooge.\" Her husband confirmed it was Scrooge, explaining he had seen him through his office window, which wasn't shut, with a candle inside. He added that he'd heard Scrooge's partner was dying and that Scrooge was sitting there completely alone. \"Spirit!\" Scrooge exclaimed in a choked voice, \"take me away from this place.\" The Ghost responded that it was only showing him visions of the past and wasn't to blame for what they contained. Scrooge cried out again, unable to bear it any longer. He turned towards the Ghost and, seeing that its face strangely combined fragments of all the faces it had shown him, he began to struggle with it, begging it to leave him, take him back, and stop tormenting him. During this struggle, if it could be called a struggle as the Ghost offered no visible resistance and remained undisturbed by Scrooge's efforts, Scrooge noticed the Spirit's light was burning very brightly. Connecting this light vaguely with the Ghost's power, he grabbed the cap used to extinguish candles and quickly pressed it down onto the Spirit's head. The Spirit shrank beneath it, entirely covered by the cap. However, despite Scrooge pressing down with all his strength, he couldn't hide the light, which streamed out from under the cap and flooded the ground. He became aware of being exhausted and overwhelmed by an uncontrollable urge to sleep, and also that he was back in his own bedroom. He squeezed the cap one last time before his hand went limp, and he barely managed to stagger to his bed before falling into a deep, heavy sleep.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "\"Spirit!\" cried Scrooge, \"please, don’t show me any more. Take me home. Why do you enjoy tormenting me?\" \n\"Just one more scene!\" insisted the Ghost.\n\"No, no more!\" pleaded Scrooge. \"I don’t want to see it. Please, show me nothing else!\"\nBut the determined Ghost gripped Scrooge firmly, forcing him to witness what followed.\nThey suddenly appeared in another place—a modest but cozy room. Sitting near a winter fire was a lovely young woman, looking so much like the last that Scrooge momentarily thought they were the same, until he noticed the young woman, now a graceful mother, sitting across from her daughter. The room was filled with noise and chaos, far more children ran around than Scrooge could count in his disturbed state of mind. Unlike the famous poem where forty children behave as one, in this room, each child behaved like forty, creating a commotion almost impossible to believe. Yet nobody cared about the bedlam; the mother and daughter only laughed and seemed to enjoy the uproar. The daughter soon joined in the children's games, only to be playfully attacked by the lively group. Watching, the narrator wishes he could have joined in, though he claims he could never have been so mischievous, or done any harm, like snatching a shoe or tugging hair. Measuring their waists as the kids did would have seemed too bold, and he jokes his arm would never straighten again from such a prank. And yet, he admits, he would have treasured a chance to gently touch her lips, to hear her speak, to see her lowered lashes, to hold a strand of her hair—a keepsake beyond price; in short, he confesses he’d have loved to be a child among them, but wise enough to know the true worth of such a moment.\n\nSuddenly, there was a knock at the door, and the children rushed so eagerly that the young mother, with laughing face and tousled clothes, was swept to greet the returning father, who arrived with a friend loaded with Christmas presents. Chaos erupted as the children climbed him and rummaged through his pockets, cheering and hugging him with wild affection, and clamoring excitedly as each present was revealed. Amusement reached a peak when it seemed the baby tried to eat a toy frying-pan and might have swallowed a fake turkey, but everyone was relieved the scare was false. The joy and excitement were overwhelming. Gradually, the children made their way out of the parlour, up the stairs to bed, and calm finally returned.\n\nScrooge watched the scene more intently than ever as the father, with his daughter by his side, sat down with his wife and child. When Scrooge thought about how a child such as that could have called him father—and brought happiness to his own lonely existence—his eyes filled with tears.\n\"Belle,\" said the husband warmly to his wife, \"I saw an old friend of yours this afternoon.\"\n\"Who was it?\"\n\"Guess!\"\n\"I can’t imagine. Wait, I know—Mr. Scrooge.\"\n\"Yes, it was Mr. Scrooge. I passed by his office and saw it was still open, with a candle burning. I heard his partner is near death, and he was sitting there, completely alone. Truly alone in the world.\"\n\n\"Spirit!\" Scrooge said in a broken voice, \"Please, take me away from here.\"\n\"I told you these were memories from the past,\" the Ghost replied. \"I can’t change them, nor am I to blame for them.\"\n\"Get me out!\" cried Scrooge. \"I can’t endure this!\"\nHe turned to fight the Ghost, which now appeared to wear traces of every face it had shown him that night, and struggled with it.\n\"Leave me! Take me back! Don’t haunt me anymore!\"\nDespite Scrooge’s frantic efforts, the Ghost was unmoved, and its light blazed even brighter. Remembering the influence of that light, Scrooge grabbed the Ghost’s extinguisher-cap and quickly forced it over the Ghost’s head. The Ghost vanished beneath, covered entirely by the cap, but no matter how tightly Scrooge held it down, the light glowed out from beneath and flooded the ground.\n\nOverwhelmed and exhausted, Scrooge felt an irresistible sleep overtake him, and became aware he was back in his own bedroom. He gave the cap a final squeeze before collapsing into bed and falling into a deep, heavy sleep."

He felt that he was restored to consciousness in the right nick of time, for the especial purpose of holding a conference with the second messenger despatched to him through Jacob Marley’s intervention. But finding that he turned uncomfortably cold when he began to wonder which of his curtains this new spectre would draw back, he put them every one aside with his own hands; and lying down again, established a sharp look-out all round the bed. For he wished to challenge the Spirit on the moment of its appearance, and did not wish to be taken by surprise, and made nervous.\nGentlemen of the free-and-easy sort, who plume themselves on being acquainted with a move or two, and being usually equal to the time-of-day, express the wide range of their capacity for adventure by observing that they are good for anything from pitch-and-toss to manslaughter; between which opposite extremes, no doubt, there lies a tolerably wide and comprehensive range of subjects. Without venturing for Scrooge quite as hardily as this, I don’t mind calling on you to believe that he was ready for a good broad field of strange appearances, and that nothing between a baby and rhinoceros would have astonished him very much.\nNow, being prepared for almost anything, he was not by any means prepared for nothing; and, consequently, when the Bell struck One, and no shape appeared, he was taken with a violent fit of trembling. Five minutes, ten minutes, a quarter of an hour went by, yet nothing came. All this time, he lay upon his bed, the very core and centre of a blaze of ruddy light, which streamed upon it when the clock proclaimed the hour; and which, being only light, was more alarming than a dozen ghosts, as he was powerless to make out what it meant, or would be at; and was sometimes apprehensive that he might be at that very moment an interesting case of spontaneous combustion, without having the consolation of knowing it. At last, however, he began to think—as you or I would have thought at first; for it is always the person not in the predicament who knows what ought to have been done in it, and would unquestionably have done it too—at last, I say, he began to think that the source and secret of this ghostly light might be in the adjoining room, from whence, on further tracing it, it seemed to shine. This idea taking full possession of his mind, he got up softly and shuffled in his slippers to the door.\nThe moment Scrooge’s hand was on the lock, a strange voice called him by his name, and bade him enter. He obeyed.\nIt was his own room. There was no doubt about that. But it had undergone a surprising transformation. The walls and ceiling were so hung with living green, that it looked a perfect grove; from every part of which, bright gleaming berries glistened. The crisp leaves of holly, mistletoe, and ivy reflected back the light, as if so many little mirrors had been scattered there; and such a mighty blaze went roaring up the chimney, as that dull petrification of a hearth had never known in Scrooge’s time, or Marley’s, or for many and many a winter season gone. Heaped up on the floor, to form a kind of throne, were turkeys, geese, game, poultry, brawn, great joints of meat, sucking-pigs, long wreaths of sausages, mince-pies, plum-puddings, barrels of oysters, red-hot chestnuts, cherry-cheeked apples, juicy oranges, luscious pears, immense twelfth-cakes, and seething bowls of punch, that made the chamber dim with their delicious steam. In easy state upon this couch, there sat a jolly Giant, glorious to see; who bore a glowing torch, in shape not unlike Plenty’s horn, and held it up, high up, to shed its light on Scrooge, as he came peeping round the door.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "Waking up from a huge snore, Scrooge sat up in bed to gather his thoughts. He didn't need to be told that the clock was striking One again; he knew he had woken up at exactly the right moment to meet the second spirit sent by Jacob Marley. However, feeling uncomfortably cold while wondering which curtain the new ghost would pull back, he decided to open all the curtains himself. Then, lying back down, he kept a sharp watch around his bed. He wanted to challenge the Spirit the moment it appeared and didn't want to be surprised and feel nervous.\n\nThe narrator compares Scrooge's readiness to adventurous people who brag they can handle anything from petty games to serious crimes. While not claiming Scrooge was *that* daring, the author assures the reader that Scrooge was prepared for a wide variety of strange sights and that he wouldn't have been very shocked by anything from a baby to a rhinoceros.\n\nNow, being ready for almost anything, he was definitely not ready for *nothing* to happen. Consequently, when the clock struck One and no figure appeared, he started shaking uncontrollably. Five, then ten, then fifteen minutes passed, and still, nothing came. During this time, he lay in his bed, caught in the centre of a bright red light that started when the clock struck the hour. This light, being just light, was more frightening than a dozen ghosts because he couldn't understand what it meant or what it was doing; sometimes, he even feared he might be undergoing spontaneous combustion at that very moment without knowing it. Finally, he began to think – as you or I would have thought immediately, since it's always easier to know what to do when you're not in the difficult situation – that the source of this mysterious light might be in the adjacent room, which, when he traced it further, seemed to be where the light was coming from. With this idea firmly in his mind, he quietly got out of bed and shuffled in his slippers to the door.\n\nThe instant Scrooge's hand touched the doorknob, a strange voice called his name and invited him in. He obeyed.\n\nIt was his own room, without a doubt. But it had been astonishingly transformed. The walls and ceiling were covered in living green plants, making it look like a perfect grove, with bright, shiny berries sparkling everywhere. The sharp leaves of holly, mistletoe, and ivy reflected the light like countless small mirrors scattered about. A huge, roaring fire burned in the chimney, something that plain fireplace had never experienced in Scrooge's time, Marley's, or any winter season in memory. Piled up on the floor, creating a kind of throne, were mounds of food: turkeys, geese, game, poultry, brawn, large joints of meat, sucking pigs, long strings of sausages, mince pies, plum puddings, barrels of oysters, hot chestnuts, rosy apples, juicy oranges, delicious pears, enormous Twelfth-cakes, and bubbling bowls of punch, whose delicious steam made the room hazy. Sitting comfortably on this food-pile couch was a cheerful Giant, a magnificent sight. He held a glowing torch shaped somewhat like a cornucopia and lifted it high to shine its light on Scrooge as he cautiously peeked around the door.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "Waking suddenly from a deep snore and sitting up in bed to gather his thoughts, Scrooge instinctively knew it was nearly one o'clock again. He realized he had been brought back to awareness just in time to meet the second spirit sent to him through Marley’s intervention. Feeling a chill as he imagined which curtain this new ghost might open, Scrooge decided to pull all the curtains aside himself. Lying back down, he kept a vigilant watch around his bed, determined not to be caught off guard or startled by the spirit’s arrival.\n\nAdventurous men who pride themselves on being experienced often claim they can handle anything from games of chance to matters as serious as manslaughter, covering a very broad spectrum. While Scrooge perhaps didn’t have quite this confidence, you can believe he was ready for any weird sight, and nothing between an infant and a rhinoceros would have greatly surprised him.\n\nNevertheless, although prepared for almost anything, Scrooge was not prepared for nothing to happen at all. So when the bell struck one and no ghost appeared, he was seized by trembling. Five minutes passed, then ten, then fifteen, but still nothing happened. All this time, he lay in bed surrounded by a reddish glow that filled the room when the clock struck, and since it was just light and not a visible presence, it was even more unsettling than a host of ghosts, especially as he couldn’t figure out what it meant. At times, he even worried he might be spontaneously combusting without knowing it. Eventually, he began to wonder—as any outsider might have done much sooner—if the source of the strange light was in the next room. Pursuing this idea, he quietly got up and shuffled in his slippers to the door.\n\nAs soon as Scrooge touched the doorknob, a peculiar voice called his name and told him to come in. He obeyed.\n\nHe found himself in his own room, but it had been transformed. The walls and ceiling were draped with living greenery, turning it into a lush grove, with gleaming berries everywhere. Holly, mistletoe, and ivy leaves glittered as if they were tiny mirrors, and an enormous fire roared up the chimney, far surpassing any hearth fire known to Scrooge or Marley for years. On the floor was a mountain of food—turkeys, geese, game birds, all kinds of meats, sausages, mince pies, plum puddings, barrels of oysters, steaming chestnuts, rosy apples, juicy oranges, pears, enormous cakes, and steaming bowls of punch, filling the room with their delicious aromas. Seated comfortably on this feast was a cheerful Giant, splendid to behold, who held a blazing torch shaped like a horn of plenty, raising it to illuminate Scrooge as he peeked around the door."

Its feet, observable beneath the ample folds of the garment, were also bare; and on its head it wore no other covering than a holly wreath, set here and there with shining icicles. Its dark brown curls were long and free; free as its genial face, its sparkling eye, its open hand, its cheery voice, its unconstrained demeanour, and its joyful air. Girded round its middle was an antique scabbard; but no sword was in it, and the ancient sheath was eaten up with rust.\n“You have never seen the like of me before!” exclaimed the Spirit.\n“Never,” Scrooge made answer to it.\n“Have never walked forth with the younger members of my family; meaning (for I am very young) my elder brothers born in these later years?” pursued the Phantom.\n“I don’t think I have,” said Scrooge. “I am afraid I have not.

He was no longer the stubborn Scrooge he once was; even though the Spirit's gaze was clear and compassionate, he avoided meeting it. “I am the Ghost of Christmas Present,” the Spirit declared. “Observe me!” Scrooge complied with respect. The Spirit was dressed in a simple green robe, or cloak, edged with white fur. This clothing hung so loosely on the figure that its ample chest was uncovered, as if refusing to be shielded or hidden by any device. Its feet, visible beneath the wide folds of the garment, were also bare; and on its head, it wore nothing but a wreath of holly, adorned here and there with glistening icicles. Its dark brown hair was long and flowed freely, just like its cheerful face, its bright eyes, its open hand, its pleasant voice, its relaxed manner, and its joyous presence. Around its waist was fastened an old sword scabbard; but it contained no sword, and the aged case was covered in rust. “You have never encountered anyone like me before!” the Spirit exclaimed. “Never,” Scrooge responded. “Have you never ventured out with the younger members of my lineage; meaning (since I am quite young) my older siblings born in recent years?” the Phantom inquired. “I don't believe I have,” said Scrooge. “I'm afraid I haven't. Have you had many brothers, Spirit?” “More than eighteen hundred,” the Ghost replied. “A vast number to look after!” Scrooge mumbled.",

The ghost wore a plain green robe trimmed with white fur, which draped so loosely that its broad chest was exposed, seeming to reject any covering. Its feet, visible beneath the robe, were bare, and a simple holly wreath adorned its head, decorated with sparkling icicles. The Spirit’s long dark brown hair hung freely, just like its open and cheerful face, bright eyes, outstretched hand, hearty voice, natural manner, and joyful spirit. Around its waist was an old empty scabbard, so rusted by age that it held no sword.\n\n\"You’ve never seen anyone like me before!\" the Spirit said.\n\n\"Never,\" Scrooge replied.\n\n\"You’ve never accompanied the younger members of my family—referring to my older brothers born in recent years?\" the Ghost asked.\n\n\"I don’t believe I have,\" replied Scrooge. \"I’m afraid I haven’t. Do you have many brothers, Spirit?\"\n\n\"More than eighteen hundred,\" said the Ghost.\n\n\"That must be a difficult family to care for!\" Scrooge muttered."

So did the room, the fire, the ruddy glow, the hour of night, and they stood in the city streets on Christmas morning, where (for the weather was severe) the people made a rough, but brisk and not unpleasant kind of music, in scraping the snow from the pavement in front of their dwellings, and from the tops of their houses, whence it was mad delight to the boys to see it come plumping down into the road below, and splitting into artificial little snow-storms.\nThe house fronts looked black enough, and the windows blacker, contrasting with the smooth white sheet of snow upon the roofs, and with the dirtier snow upon the ground; which last deposit had been ploughed up in deep furrows by the heavy wheels of carts and waggons; furrows that crossed and re-crossed each other hundreds of times where the great streets branched off; and made intricate channels, hard to trace in the thick yellow mud and icy water.

Scrooge obeyed and held on tightly. Instantly, all the festive decorations and food – the holly, mistletoe, berries, ivy, turkeys, geese, game birds, chicken, preserved meat, pork, sausages, oysters, pies, puddings, fruit, and punch – vanished. The room, the fire, the warm glow, and the time of night also disappeared. Suddenly, they were standing in the city streets on Christmas morning. Because the weather was harsh, people created a rough but lively and almost pleasant sound as they scraped snow from the sidewalks in front of their homes and from their rooftops. From the roofs, boys excitedly watched the snow fall heavily into the street below, breaking apart into small, artificial snowstorms. The buildings looked quite dark, and the windows seemed even darker, starkly contrasting with the smooth white snow covering the roofs and the dirtier snow on the ground. This ground snow was deeply cut by the heavy wheels of carts and wagons, creating trenches that crisscrossed numerous times where major streets branched off. These created complex paths that were hard to distinguish in the thick yellow mud and freezing water. The sky was dark and overcast, and the narrower streets were clogged with a grimy, thawing-and-freezing mist. Heavier particles from this mist fell like a shower of soot, as if every chimney in Great Britain had somehow spontaneously caught fire and was burning freely.",

Suddenly, all the decorations and food—holly, mistletoe, berries, meats, pies, puddings, and more—disappeared at once. The room, the warm fire, the cozy atmosphere, and even the night itself vanished. Scrooge and the Spirit were now standing outside on the city streets on Christmas morning.

These tracks were hard to spot amid the muddy slush and icy water. Overhead, the sky was dreary, and the short streets were filled with a dirty mist, part-thawed and part-frozen, that rained down grimy particles, as if all the chimneys in the country were spewing smoke into the air at once."

The poulterers’ shops were still half open, and the fruiterers’ were radiant in their glory. There were great, round, pot-bellied baskets of chestnuts, shaped like the waistcoats of jolly old gentlemen, lolling at the doors, and tumbling out into the street in their apoplectic opulence. There were ruddy, brown-faced, broad-girthed Spanish Onions, shining in the fatness of their growth like Spanish Friars, and winking from their shelves in wanton slyness at the girls as they went by, and glanced demurely at the hung-up mistletoe. There were pears and apples, clustered high in blooming pyramids; there were bunches of grapes, made, in the shopkeepers’ benevolence to dangle from conspicuous hooks, that people’s mouths might water gratis as they passed; there were piles of filberts, mossy and brown, recalling, in their fragrance, ancient walks among the woods, and pleasant shufflings ankle deep through withered leaves; there were Norfolk Biffins, squat and swarthy, setting off the yellow of the oranges and lemons, and, in the great compactness of their juicy persons, urgently entreating and beseeching to be carried home in paper bags and eaten after dinner. The very gold and silver fish, set forth among these choice fruits in a bowl, though members of a dull and stagnant-blooded race, appeared to know that there was something going on; and, to a fish, went gasping round and round their little world in slow and passionless excitement.\nThe Grocers’! oh, the Grocers’! nearly closed, with perhaps two shutters down, or one; but through those gaps such glimpses! It was not alone that the scales descending on the counter made a merry sound, or that the twine and roller parted company so briskly, or that the canisters were rattled up and down like juggling tricks, or even that the blended scents of tea and coffee were so grateful to the nose, or even that the raisins were so plentiful and rare, the almonds so extremely white, the sticks of cinnamon so long and straight, the other spices so delicious, the candied fruits so caked and spotted with molten sugar as to make the coldest lookers-on feel faint and subsequently bilious. Nor was it that the figs were moist and pulpy, or that the French plums blushed in modest tartness from their highly-decorated boxes, or that everything was good to eat and in its Christmas dress; but the customers were all so hurried and so eager in the hopeful promise of the day, that they tumbled up against each other at the door, crashing their wicker baskets wildly, and left their purchases upon the counter, and came running back to fetch them, and committed hundreds of the like mistakes, in the best humour possible; while the Grocer and his people were so frank and fresh that the polished hearts with which they fastened their aprons behind might have been their own, worn outside for general inspection, and for Christmas daws to peck at if they chose.\nBut soon the steeples called good people all, to church and chapel, and away they came, flocking through the streets in their best clothes, and with their gayest faces. And at the same time there emerged from scores of bye-streets, lanes, and nameless turnings, innumerable people, carrying their dinners to the bakers’ shops. The sight of these poor revellers appeared to interest the Spirit very much, for he stood with Scrooge beside him in a baker’s doorway, and taking off the covers as their bearers passed, sprinkled incense on their dinners from his torch. And it was a very uncommon kind of torch, for once or twice when there were angry words between some dinner-carriers who had jostled each other, he shed a few drops of water on them from it, and their good humour was restored directly. For they said, it was a shame to quarrel upon Christmas Day. And so it was! God love it, so it was!\nIn time the bells ceased, and the bakers were shut up; and yet there was a genial shadowing forth of all these dinners and the progress of their cooking, in the thawed blotch of wet above each baker’s oven; where the pavement smoked as if its stones were cooking too.\n“Is there a peculiar flavour in what you sprinkle from your torch?” asked Scrooge.\n“There is. My own.”\n“Would it apply to any kind of dinner on this day?” asked Scrooge.\n“To any kindly given. To a poor one most.”\n“Why to a poor one most?” asked Scrooge.\n“Because it needs it most.”\n“Spirit,” said Scrooge, after a moment’s thought, “I wonder you, of all the beings in the many worlds about us, should desire to cramp these people’s opportunities of innocent enjoyment.”\n“I!” cried the Spirit.\n“You would deprive them of their means of dining every seventh day, often the only day on which they can be said to dine at all,” said Scrooge. “Wouldn’t you?”\n“I!” cried the Spirit.\n“You seek to close these places on the Seventh Day?” said Scrooge. “And it comes to the same thing.”\n“I seek!” exclaimed the Spirit.\n“Forgive me if I am wrong. It has been done in your name, or at least in that of your family,” said Scrooge.\n“There are some upon this earth of yours,” returned the Spirit, “who lay claim to know us, and who do their deeds of passion, pride, ill-will, hatred, envy, bigotry, and selfishness in our name, who are as strange to us and all our kith and kin, as if they had never lived. Remember that, and charge their doings on themselves, not us.”",

Those clearing snow from rooftops were cheerful and lively, shouting greetings to each other from the edges of the buildings and occasionally throwing playful snowballs – a much kinder projectile than harsh words – laughing heartily whether they hit their mark or not. The poultry and fruit shops were still welcoming, their displays radiating a glorious abundance. Large, round, bulging baskets of chestnuts, resembling the bellies of jolly old gentlemen, sat overflowing at the entrances, spilling onto the street in their sheer plumpness. There were plump, brown-skinned, wide Spanish Onions, gleaming richly like Spanish Friars, winking mischievously from the shelves at young women who passed by and glanced shyly at the hanging mistletoe. Pears and apples were piled high in colourful stacks; bunches of grapes were hung by the shopkeepers from visible hooks, encouraging passers-by to admire them and feel tempted. Piles of earthy, brown filberts evoked memories of walks in the woods and the sound of shuffling through fallen leaves. Short, dark Norfolk Biffins contrasted with the bright yellow of oranges and lemons, their firm, juicy appearance practically begging to be bought in paper bags and enjoyed after dinner. Even the gold and silver fish in a bowl among the fruits, despite their naturally calm nature, seemed aware of the festive energy, swimming slowly and steadily around their little world with quiet animation.\nThe Grocers'! Oh, the Grocers'! Though mostly closed, with perhaps one or two shutters down, the glimpses inside were wonderful! It wasn't just the cheerful clang of the scales, the swift unrolling of twine, the playful rattling of canisters, the pleasant mix of tea and coffee aromas, the generous display of rare raisins, the extremely white almonds, the long, straight cinnamon sticks, the delicious other spices, or the candied fruits so thickly coated with melted sugar they could make onlookers feel ill. It wasn't just the soft, moist figs or the French plums modestly blushing in their fancy boxes, or the fact that everything looked ready for Christmas feasting; it was the customers themselves, so eager and excited about the holiday that they bumped into each other at the door, their wicker baskets clattering, leaving their purchases on the counter only to rush back for them, making countless such happy mistakes. All the while, the Grocer and his staff were so warm and open, it seemed their kind hearts were polished and pinned outside their aprons for everyone to see, even for Christmas jackdaws to peck at.\nSoon, church bells called everyone to worship, and people poured into the streets in their best clothes, looking joyous, heading to churches and chapels. Simultaneously, countless people emerged from smaller streets, lanes, and hidden corners, carrying their dinners to be cooked at the bakers' shops. The sight of these poorer folk celebrating seemed to deeply interest the Spirit; he stood with Scrooge in a baker's doorway, and as people passed with their meals, he lifted the covers and sprinkled essence from his torch onto the food. This was an unusual torch, for once or twice when people carrying dinners argued after bumping into each other, he sprinkled a few drops of water from it, and their good temper was instantly restored. They realised it was wrong to quarrel on Christmas Day, and indeed it was! Bless its heart, it truly was!\nEventually, the bells fell silent and the bakers' shops closed. Yet, the presence and cooking of all those dinners were clearly suggested by the damp patches above each baker's oven, where the pavement below seemed to steam as if it, too, were being baked.\n\"Does what you sprinkle from your torch have a special quality?\" Scrooge asked.\n\"Yes. It is my own quality.\"\n\"Would it work on any dinner today?\" Scrooge inquired.\n\"On any given kindly. Most of all on a poor one.\"\n\"Why especially on a poor one?\" Scrooge asked.\n\"Because it needs it most.\"\nScrooge paused for a moment, then said, \"Spirit, I find it strange that you, of all beings in the many worlds around us, would wish to limit these people's chances for simple enjoyment.\"\n\"I!\" the Spirit exclaimed.\n\"You would deny them their means of dining every Sunday, which is often the only day they get to dine properly,\" Scrooge said. \"Wouldn't you?\"\n\"I!\" the Spirit cried.\n\"You aim to close these places on Sundays?\" Scrooge pressed. \"It amounts to the same thing.\"\n\"I aim!\" the Spirit exclaimed incredulously.\n\"Forgive me if I'm mistaken. It has been done in your name, or at least by your kind,\" Scrooge stated.\nThe Spirit replied, \"There are some on your earth who claim to represent us, and who commit acts of passion, pride, malice, hate, envy, prejudice, and selfishness in our name. They are as alien to us and all our relations as if they had never existed. Remember that, and blame their actions on them, not us.\"",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "Although the weather and the town itself weren't especially joyful, an atmosphere of happiness filled the place, more than even the best summer's day could have created. People on the rooftops shoveling snow were laughing and joking with each other, playfully tossing snowballs and enjoying both their successes and misses. The food shops were bustling, with the poulterers and fruit sellers displaying their goods—baskets of chestnuts spilling onto the streets, shiny onions, pyramids of pears and apples, tempting clusters of grapes, fragrant piles of nuts, and all sorts of festive fruit, even gold and silver fish in bowls amidst it all seemed to sense the excitement. The grocers' shops, though nearly closed, allowed glimpses of merry activity inside, with the sound of scales and rattling canisters, the scents of tea, coffee, spices, and dried fruits filling the air. Customers bustled about, so caught up in the holiday spirit that they jostled each other, forgot their purchases, and laughed at their own mistakes. The shopkeepers themselves were so warm and open-hearted, it was as if their hearts were visible to all. Soon, church bells called people in their best clothes out to worship, while others streamed from side streets carrying their dinners to bake at the local ovens. The Spirit, with Scrooge by his side, watched as he blessed these meals with incense from his torch, which had the power to restore good cheer even when tempers flared. The day progressed, with ovens cooking these shared feasts, their warmth visible as steam on the pavement. When Scrooge asked the Spirit if the flavor sprinkled from his torch benefited all Christmas dinners, the Spirit replied it did, especially for those of the poor, because they need it most. Scrooge questioned why the Spirit would want to limit their only opportunity for dining together by closing bakeries on Sundays, but the Spirit insisted such actions were not his doing, and that people who act in the name of the Spirits yet behave selfishly or cruelly do not truly represent them; their actions are their own responsibility."

Bob had but fifteen “Bob” a-week himself; he pocketed on Saturdays but fifteen copies of his Christian name; and yet the Ghost of Christmas Present blessed his four-roomed house!\nThen up rose Mrs. Cratchit, Cratchit’s wife, dressed out but poorly in a twice-turned gown, but brave in ribbons, which are cheap and make a goodly show for sixpence; and she laid the cloth, assisted by Belinda Cratchit, second of her daughters, also brave in ribbons; while Master Peter Cratchit plunged a fork into the saucepan of potatoes, and getting the corners of his monstrous shirt collar (Bob’s private property, conferred upon his son and heir in honour of the day) into his mouth, rejoiced to find himself so gallantly attired, and yearned to show his linen in the fashionable Parks. And now two smaller Cratchits, boy and girl, came tearing in, screaming that outside the baker’s they had smelt the goose, and known it for their own; and basking in luxurious thoughts of sage and onion, these young Cratchits danced about the table, and exalted Master Peter Cratchit to the skies, while he (not proud, although his collars nearly choked him) blew the fire, until the slow potatoes bubbling up, knocked loudly at the saucepan-lid to be let out and peeled.\n“What has ever got your precious father then?” said Mrs. Cratchit. “And your brother, Tiny Tim! And Martha warn’t as late last Christmas Day by half-an-hour?”\n“Here’s Martha, mother!” said a girl, appearing as she spoke.\n“Here’s Martha, mother!” cried the two young Cratchits. “Hurrah! There’s such a goose, Martha!”\n“Why, bless your heart alive, my dear, how late you are!” said Mrs. Cratchit, kissing her a dozen times, and taking off her shawl and bonnet for her with officious zeal.\n“We’d a deal of work to finish up last night,” replied the girl, “and had to clear away this morning, mother!”\n“Well! Never mind so long as you are come,” said Mrs. Cratchit. “Sit ye down before the fire, my dear, and have a warm, Lord bless ye!”\n“No, no! There’s father coming,” cried the two young Cratchits, who were everywhere at once. “Hide, Martha, hide!”\nSo Martha hid herself, and in came little Bob, the father, with at least three feet of comforter exclusive of the fringe, hanging down before him; and his threadbare clothes darned up and brushed, to look seasonable; and Tiny Tim upon his shoulder. Alas for Tiny Tim, he bore a little crutch, and had his limbs supported by an iron frame!\n“Why, where’s our Martha?” cried Bob Cratchit, looking round.\n“Not coming,” said Mrs. Cratchit.\n“Not coming!” said Bob, with a sudden declension in his high spirits; for he had been Tim’s blood horse all the way from church, and had come home rampant. “Not coming upon Christmas Day!”\nMartha didn’t like to see him disappointed, if it were only in joke; so she came out prematurely from behind the closet door, and ran into his arms, while the two young Cratchits hustled Tiny Tim, and bore him off into the wash-house, that he might hear the pudding singing in the copper.\n“And how did little Tim behave?” asked Mrs. Cratchit, when she had rallied Bob on his credulity, and Bob had hugged his daughter to his heart’s content.\n“As good as gold,” said Bob, “and better. Somehow he gets thoughtful, sitting by himself so much, and thinks the strangest things you ever heard. He told me, coming home, that he hoped the people saw him in the church, because he was a cripple, and it might be pleasant to them to remember upon Christmas Day, who made lame beggars walk, and blind men see.”\nBob’s voice was tremulous when he told them this, and trembled more when he said that Tiny Tim was growing strong and hearty.\nHis active little crutch was heard upon the floor, and back came Tiny Tim before another word was spoken, escorted by his brother and sister to his stool before the fire; and while Bob, turning up his cuffs—as if, poor fellow, they were capable of being made more shabby—compounded some hot mixture in a jug with gin and lemons, and stirred it round and round and put it on the hob to simmer; Master Peter, and the two ubiquitous young Cratchits went to fetch the goose, with which they soon returned in high procession.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "Scrooge confirmed he would, and just as before, they proceeded unseen into the town's outskirts. A notable characteristic of the Spirit (something Scrooge had observed earlier at the baker's) was his remarkable ability, despite his massive size, to easily fit anywhere; he stood under a low ceiling with the same grace and supernatural presence he would command in a high hall. Perhaps the good Spirit enjoyed displaying this power, or maybe it was his naturally kind, generous, and warm disposition, along with his sympathy for all poor people, that guided him directly to Scrooge's clerk's home. That's where he went, and Scrooge followed, holding onto his cloak. Standing at the doorstep, the Spirit smiled and paused to bless Bob Cratchit's home by sprinkling it with light from his torch. Consider this! Bob himself earned merely fifteen shillings per week; he took home just fifteen coins bearing his Christian name every Saturday. Yet, the Ghost of Christmas Present blessed his small four-room dwelling! Then Mrs. Cratchit, the wife, appeared, dressed simply in a worn dress that had been altered twice, but brightened with inexpensive ribbons that gave a cheerful look for a few pennies. She set the table, assisted by Belinda Cratchit, her second daughter, also brightened with ribbons. Meanwhile, Master Peter Cratchit thrust a fork into the potato pot, getting the corners of his enormous shirt collar (Bob's, passed down to his son and heir for the holiday) into his mouth. He was thrilled to feel so smartly dressed and longed to show off his collar in the fashionable parks. At that moment, two smaller Cratchit children, a boy and a girl, ran in screaming. They had smelled the goose outside the baker's and recognized it as theirs. Lost in delightful thoughts of sage and onion, these young Cratchits danced around the table, praising Master Peter Cratchit to the skies. He (not proud, though his collar was nearly suffocating him) blew on the fire until the slowly boiling potatoes bubbled up, knocking loudly against the saucepan lid, ready to be let out and peeled. \"Where can your dear father be?\" asked Mrs. Cratchit. \"And your brother, Tiny Tim! Martha wasn't this late last Christmas Day, not by half an hour!\" \"Here's Martha, Mother!\" a girl announced as she entered. \"Here's Martha, Mother!\" shouted the two young Cratchits. \"Hooray! The goose is so wonderful, Martha!\" \"Oh, bless your heart, my dear, how late you are!\" said Mrs. Cratchit, covering her with kisses and busily helping her remove her shawl and bonnet. \"We had a lot of work to finish last night,\" the girl replied, \"and had to tidy up this morning, Mother!\" \"Well! It doesn't matter as long as you've arrived,\" said Mrs. Cratchit. \"Come sit by the fire, my dear, and get warm, God bless you!\" \"No, no! Father's coming,\" yelled the two lively young Cratchits, who seemed to be everywhere at once. \"Hide, Martha, hide!\" So Martha concealed herself. Then in came little Bob, the father, wearing a comforter at least three feet long, not including the fringe, hanging down in front. His worn clothes were carefully darned and brushed to look festive. And Tiny Tim was on his shoulder. Sadly for Tiny Tim, he carried a small crutch, and his legs were supported by an iron frame. \"Why, where is our Martha?\" asked Bob Cratchit, looking around. \"Not coming,\" said Mrs. Cratchit. \"Not coming!\" exclaimed Bob, his high spirits suddenly dampened; he had been Tim's energetic 'horse' all the way from church and had arrived home full of vigour. \"Not coming on Christmas Day!\" Martha didn't want to see him disappointed, even in jest. So she emerged from behind the closet door sooner than planned and rushed into his arms, while the two young Cratchits quickly led Tiny Tim away to the wash-house so he could hear the pudding bubbling in the pot. \"And how did little Tim behave?\" asked Mrs. Cratchit, after she had teased Bob about being so easily fooled and Bob had hugged his daughter with complete satisfaction. \"As good as gold,\" said Bob, \"and even better. He gets thoughtful somehow, sitting by himself so often, and thinks the strangest things you've ever heard. He told me, coming home, that he hoped people saw him in church because he was disabled, and perhaps it would please them on Christmas Day to remember who enabled lame beggars to walk and blind men to see.\" Bob's voice was shaky when he shared this, and it trembled even more when he mentioned that Tiny Tim was getting stronger and healthier. His small, active crutch was heard on the floor, and Tiny Tim returned before another word was spoken, guided by his brother and sister to his stool by the fire. While Bob, rolling up his cuffs—as if, poor fellow, they could possibly look any more worn—mixed a hot drink in a jug with gin and lemons, stirring it repeatedly and placing it on the hob to simmer, Master Peter and the two energetic young Cratchits went to fetch the goose, returning quickly in a grand procession.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "Scrooge agreed to what was asked of him, and together they went on unseen, just as they had been, traveling to the outskirts of the city. Scrooge had noticed at the baker’s shop that, despite the Ghost being very large, he could easily fit anywhere, even standing comfortably and gracefully under low ceilings, seeming just as majestic as he would in a grand hall. Perhaps the Spirit enjoyed demonstrating this ability, or maybe it was due to his kind and generous nature, and his compassion for the poor, that led him directly to the home of Scrooge’s clerk. He brought Scrooge along, holding onto his robe, and when they reached Bob Cratchit’s humble door, the Spirit smiled and paused to bless the dwelling by sprinkling it with his torch. Imagine that! Bob Cratchit earned only fifteen shillings a week—fittingly, he took home fifteen “Bobs”—yet the Ghost of Christmas Present saw fit to bless his small, four-roomed house.\n\nInside, Mrs. Cratchit was getting things ready for Christmas. Her dress was old and had been altered more than once, but she made it look cheerful with bright ribbons, which were inexpensive yet festive. Her daughter Belinda helped set the table, also decorated with ribbons. Meanwhile, Master Peter Cratchit was trying to help with the meal, wearing an enormous, hand-me-down shirt collar of his father’s, proud to be dressed up and wishing he could show off his fine linen in the parks. Two of the younger Cratchit children rushed inside, excitedly shouting that they had smelled the goose roasting at the baker’s and recognized it as their own. Dreaming of the delicious meal, they danced around the table and praised Peter, who, not particularly vain despite his fancy collar, tended the fire while the potatoes boiled energetically in the pot.\n\nMrs. Cratchit wondered aloud why her husband and Tiny Tim were late, and noted that their daughter Martha hadn’t been so late last Christmas Day. At that moment, Martha appeared at the door, greeted enthusiastically by her siblings, who exclaimed about the wonderful goose. Mrs. Cratchit welcomed Martha warmly, fussing over her and helping her to get settled. Martha explained that she was late because of work she had to finish the night before and cleaning that morning. Mrs. Cratchit reassured her that it didn’t matter, as long as she was home now.\n\nSuddenly, the younger Cratchits heard their father returning and urged Martha to hide, so she did. Bob Cratchit entered, wearing a long scarf and patched, brushed clothes intended to look festive. He carried Tiny Tim on his shoulder, who used a crutch and wore a brace to support his legs. Looking around and not seeing Martha, Bob was disappointed when his wife told him she wasn’t coming, his spirits dropping instantly, as he’d been playfully carrying Tim home from church. However, Martha didn’t want to make him sad, even as a joke, so she quickly came out of hiding and ran to embrace him. The younger siblings took Tiny Tim off to the wash-house so he could listen to the pudding cooking.\n\nWhen things settled, Mrs. Cratchit teased Bob about believing Martha wasn’t coming, and Bob, after hugging Martha, was asked how Tiny Tim behaved at church. Bob replied that Tiny Tim was as good as gold, and even more so. He mentioned that Tim, who spent a lot of time reflecting, had told him on the way home that he hoped people saw him in church, since he was disabled, and that it might remind them on Christmas Day of Jesus, who healed the lame and the blind. Bob’s voice shook as he told this story, and even more so when he said that Tiny Tim was getting stronger.\n\nTiny Tim’s crutch was heard as he returned, helped by his siblings to his seat by the fire. Bob, pushing up his battered cuffs, started making a hot drink of gin and lemons, letting it warm by the fire, while Peter and the two youngest Cratchits paraded off to collect the goose, returning with it in high spirits."

          "text_segment": "Such a bustle ensued that you might have thought a goose the rarest of all birds; a feathered phenomenon, to which a black swan was a matter of course—and in truth it was something very like it in that house. Mrs. Cratchit made the gravy (ready beforehand in a little saucepan) hissing hot; Master Peter mashed the potatoes with incredible vigour; Miss Belinda sweetened up the apple-sauce; Martha dusted the hot plates; Bob took Tiny Tim beside him in a tiny corner at the table; the two young Cratchits set chairs for everybody, not forgetting themselves, and mounting guard upon their posts, crammed spoons into their mouths, lest they should shriek for goose before their turn came to be helped. At last the dishes were set on, and grace was said. It was succeeded by a breathless pause, as Mrs. Cratchit, looking slowly all along the carving-knife, prepared to plunge it in the breast; but when she did, and when the long expected gush of stuffing issued forth, one murmur of delight arose all round the board, and even Tiny Tim, excited by the two young Cratchits, beat on the table with the handle of his knife, and feebly cried Hurrah!\nThere never was such a goose. Bob said he didn’t believe there ever was such a goose cooked. Its tenderness and flavour, size and cheapness, were the themes of universal admiration. Eked out by apple-sauce and mashed potatoes, it was a sufficient dinner for the whole family; indeed, as Mrs. Cratchit said with great delight (surveying one small atom of a bone upon the dish), they hadn’t ate it all at last! Yet every one had had enough, and the youngest Cratchits in particular, were steeped in sage and onion to the eyebrows! But now, the plates being changed by Miss Belinda, Mrs. Cratchit left the room alone—too nervous to bear witnesses—to take the pudding up and bring it in.\nSuppose it should not be done enough! Suppose it should break in turning out! Suppose somebody should have got over the wall of the back-yard, and stolen it, while they were merry with the goose—a supposition at which the two young Cratchits became livid! All sorts of horrors were supposed.\nHallo! A great deal of steam! The pudding was out of the copper. A smell like a washing-day! That was the cloth. A smell like an eating-house and a pastrycook’s next door to each other, with a laundress’s next door to that! That was the pudding! In half a minute Mrs. Cratchit entered—flushed, but smiling proudly—with the pudding, like a speckled cannon-ball, so hard and firm, blazing in half of half-a-quartern of ignited brandy, and bedight with Christmas holly stuck into the top.\nOh, a wonderful pudding! Bob Cratchit said, and calmly too, that he regarded it as the greatest success achieved by Mrs. Cratchit since their marriage. Mrs. Cratchit said that now the weight was off her mind, she would confess she had had her doubts about the quantity of flour. Everybody had something to say about it, but nobody said or thought it was at all a small pudding for a large family. It would have been flat heresy to do so. Any Cratchit would have blushed to hint at such a thing.\nAt last the dinner was all done, the cloth was cleared, the hearth swept, and the fire made up. The compound in the jug being tasted, and considered perfect, apples and oranges were put upon the table, and a shovel-full of chestnuts on the fire. Then all the Cratchit family drew round the hearth, in what Bob Cratchit called a circle, meaning half a one; and at Bob Cratchit’s elbow stood the family display of glass. Two tumblers, and a custard-cup without a handle.\nThese held the hot stuff from the jug, however, as well as golden goblets would have done; and Bob served it out with beaming looks, while the chestnuts on the fire sputtered and cracked noisily. Then Bob proposed:\n“A Merry Christmas to us all, my dears. God bless us!”\nWhich all the family re-echoed.\n“God bless us every one!” said Tiny Tim, the last of all.\nHe sat very close to his father’s side upon his little stool. Bob held his withered little hand in his, as if he loved the child, and wished to keep him by his side, and dreaded that he might be taken from him.\n“Spirit,” said Scrooge, with an interest he had never felt before, “tell me if Tiny Tim will live.”\n“I see a vacant seat,” replied the Ghost, “in the poor chimney-corner, and a crutch without an owner, carefully preserved. If these shadows remain unaltered by the Future, the child will die.”\n“No, no,” said Scrooge. “Oh, no, kind Spirit! say he will be spared.”\n“If these shadows remain unaltered by the Future, none other of my race,” returned the Ghost, “will find him here. What then? If he be like to die, he had better do it, and decrease the surplus population.”\nScrooge hung his head to hear his own words quoted by the Spirit, and was overcome with penitence and grief.\n“Man,” said the Ghost, “if man you be in heart, not adamant, forbear that wicked cant until you have discovered What the surplus is, and Where it is. Will you decide what men shall live, what men shall die? It may be, that in the sight of Heaven, you are more worthless and less fit to live than millions like this poor man’s child. Oh God! to hear the Insect on the leaf pronouncing on the too much life among his hungry brothers in the dust!”",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "There was such a flurry of activity, you'd think a goose was the most extraordinary bird imaginable—a spectacular creature that made even a black swan seem common. And in truth, it was almost that significant in their small house. Mrs. Cratchit heated the gravy until it sizzled (she'd prepared it earlier in a small pot). Young Master Peter vigorously mashed the potatoes. Miss Belinda added sweetness to the apple-sauce. Martha wiped down the warmed plates. Bob carefully placed Tiny Tim on a small seat in a corner of the table beside him. The two youngest Cratchits arranged chairs for everyone, including themselves, and standing guard by their spots, quickly put spoons in their mouths so they wouldn't shout for goose before it was their turn. Finally, the food was served, and grace was said. A silent moment followed as Mrs. Cratchit slowly inspected the carving knife, ready to slice into the goose's breast. But when she did, and the eagerly awaited surge of stuffing emerged, a collective sound of happiness spread around the table. Even Tiny Tim, encouraged by the two young children, tapped the table with his knife handle and weakly cheered, 'Hurrah!' Bob declared he'd never tasted a goose so wonderful. Its tenderness, flavour, size, and affordability were universally praised. Supplemented with apple-sauce and mashed potatoes, it was enough food for the entire family. In fact, as Mrs. Cratchit happily noted (looking at a tiny piece of bone on the plate), they hadn't eaten absolutely everything! Yet, everyone felt satisfied, and the youngest Cratchits, in particular, were covered in sage and onion seasoning up to their eyebrows. But then, after Miss Belinda cleared the plates, Mrs. Cratchit left the room by herself—too anxious to have anyone watch—to retrieve and serve the pudding. What if it wasn't cooked enough? What if it broke apart when turned out? What if someone had climbed over the backyard wall and stolen it while they were enjoying the goose? (This last thought made the two young Cratchits look terrified!) All sorts of dreadful possibilities crossed their minds. Then, 'Hallo!' A lot of steam appeared! The pudding was out of the boiler. There was a smell like a laundry day! That was the cloth it was wrapped in. A smell like an eating-house right next to a pastry shop, with a laundress next door to them! That was the pudding itself! In about half a minute, Mrs. Cratchit came in—blushing but beaming with pride—carrying the pudding. It looked like a speckled cannon-ball, so dense and solid, blazing with brandy ignited in half of a small measure, and decorated with Christmas holly stuck into the top. 'Oh, what a fantastic pudding!' exclaimed Bob Cratchit, quite calmly adding that he considered it Mrs. Cratchit's greatest achievement since they were married. Mrs. Cratchit, relieved that the worry was gone, confessed she had had doubts about the amount of flour. Everyone had something good to say about it, but not a single person suggested or thought it was small for such a large family. To do so would have been completely out of line. Any Cratchit would have been embarrassed to even hint at such a thing. Finally, the dinner was completely finished, the tablecloth removed, the fireplace swept, and the fire built up. The mixture in the jug was sampled and deemed perfect. Apples and oranges were placed on the table, and a shovel-full of chestnuts were put on the fire. Then, all the Cratchit family gathered around the hearth, forming what Bob Cratchit called a circle, though it was really a semi-circle. And next to Bob Cratchit sat the family's collection of glassware: two tumblers and a handleless custard cup. These held the hot drink from the jug perfectly well, just as golden goblets would have. Bob poured it out with a cheerful expression, while the chestnuts on the fire crackled and popped loudly. Then Bob proposed a toast: 'A Merry Christmas to all of us, my dears. God bless us!' The entire family echoed his words. 'God bless us, every one!' added Tiny Tim last of all. He sat very close to his father's side on his little stool. Bob held his son's small, frail hand in his, as if he deeply loved the child and wanted to keep him near, fearing he might be taken away. 'Spirit,' said Scrooge, with a concern he had never felt before, 'tell me if Tiny Tim will survive.' 'I see an empty chair,' replied the Ghost, 'by the poor fireplace corner, and a crutch without an owner, carefully kept. If these scenes are not changed by the Future, the child will die.' 'No, no,' Scrooge pleaded. 'Oh, no, kind Spirit! Say he will be spared.' 'If these scenes are not changed by the Future,' the Ghost repeated, 'none of my kind will find him here. So what then? If he is likely to die, he should just do it and reduce the excess population.' Hearing the Spirit quote his own words, Scrooge hung his head, overwhelmed with remorse and sorrow. 'Man,' said the Ghost, 'if you truly have a human heart, not one made of stone, stop using that cruel phrase until you've discovered exactly What the surplus population is, and Where it is located. Do you presume to decide which people should live and which should die? Perhaps, in the eyes of Heaven, you are more worthless and less deserving of life than millions like this poor man's child. Oh God! To hear a tiny Insect on a leaf judge the excessive life among its starving companions in the dust!'",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "The scene in the Cratchit household was full of excitement and busy activity, as if a goose was the most extraordinary bird ever seen—almost as rare as a black swan—such was its value to them. Mrs. Cratchit prepared piping hot gravy she’d made earlier; Peter energetically mashed the potatoes; Belinda sweetened the apple sauce; Martha made sure the plates were clean and warm; Bob sat with Tiny Tim at his side; and the younger Cratchit children arranged chairs and, impatient with anticipation, stuffed spoons in their mouths so they wouldn't shout out for goose before it was served. When the meal was finally set out and grace was said, everyone held their breath as Mrs. Cratchit, with some ceremony, began to carve the goose. When the stuffing burst forth, a delighted cheer went around the table, with even frail Tiny Tim tapping his knife on the table in excitement and softly cheering. They all agreed it was the best goose ever, tender, flavorful, and just the right size for their family when combined with the side dishes. Mrs. Cratchit was pleased to see there was even a tiny piece left, proving everyone had had enough, especially the youngest children who were covered in sage and onion stuffing. As plates were changed, Mrs. Cratchit nervously fetched the Christmas pudding, full of anxious thoughts—what if it wasn’t cooked, or broke apart, or had even been stolen! But soon clouds of steam signaled its arrival. The kitchen was filled with scents of washing and of sweet desserts. Mrs. Cratchit, flushed but proud, brought in the plum pudding round and firm, flaming with brandy and decorated with holly. The pudding was declared a triumph, and Mrs. Cratchit admitted she’d worried it might not be enough, but no one dared suggest the pudding was too small. After dinner, the remains were cleared, and the family gathered by the fire as Bob poured out a festive drink into their few cups, and everyone toasted together, wishing each other a Merry Christmas and echoing Tiny Tim’s “God bless us every one!” Bob sat extra close to Tiny Tim, holding his frail hand protectively, fearing for his son's future. Scrooge, moved for the first time, asked the Ghost if Tiny Tim would survive. The Ghost replied with a vision of an empty seat and unused crutch, warning that unless things changed, the boy would die. When Scrooge pleaded for mercy, the Spirit used Scrooge’s own harsh words about 'surplus population' against him, rebuking the notion of deciding who is worthy to live, and pointedly asking if Scrooge thought himself more worthy in the eyes of heaven than this poor child."

          "text_segment": "Scrooge bent before the Ghost’s rebuke, and trembling cast his eyes upon the ground. But he raised them speedily, on hearing his own name.\n“Mr. Scrooge!” said Bob; “I’ll give you Mr. Scrooge, the Founder of the Feast!”\n“The Founder of the Feast indeed!” cried Mrs. Cratchit, reddening. “I wish I had him here. I’d give him a piece of my mind to feast upon, and I hope he’d have a good appetite for it.”\n“My dear,” said Bob, “the children! Christmas Day.”\n“It should be Christmas Day, I am sure,” said she, “on which one drinks the health of such an odious, stingy, hard, unfeeling man as Mr. Scrooge. You know he is, Robert! Nobody knows it better than you do, poor fellow!”\n“My dear,” was Bob’s mild answer, “Christmas Day.”\n“I’ll drink his health for your sake and the Day’s,” said Mrs. Cratchit, “not for his. Long life to him! A merry Christmas and a happy new year! He’ll be very merry and very happy, I have no doubt!”\nThe children drank the toast after her. It was the first of their proceedings which had no heartiness. Tiny Tim drank it last of all, but he didn’t care twopence for it. Scrooge was the Ogre of the family. The mention of his name cast a dark shadow on the party, which was not dispelled for full five minutes.\nAfter it had passed away, they were ten times merrier than before, from the mere relief of Scrooge the Baleful being done with. Bob Cratchit told them how he had a situation in his eye for Master Peter, which would bring in, if obtained, full five-and-sixpence weekly. The two young Cratchits laughed tremendously at the idea of Peter’s being a man of business; and Peter himself looked thoughtfully at the fire from between his collars, as if he were deliberating what particular investments he should favour when he came into the receipt of that bewildering income. Martha, who was a poor apprentice at a milliner’s, then told them what kind of work she had to do, and how many hours she worked at a stretch, and how she meant to lie abed to-morrow morning for a good long rest; to-morrow being a holiday she passed at home. Also how she had seen a countess and a lord some days before, and how the lord “was much about as tall as Peter;” at which Peter pulled up his collars so high that you couldn’t have seen his head if you had been there. All this time the chestnuts and the jug went round and round; and by-and-bye they had a song, about a lost child travelling in the snow, from Tiny Tim, who had a plaintive little voice, and sang it very well indeed.\nThere was nothing of high mark in this. They were not a handsome family; they were not well dressed; their shoes were far from being water-proof; their clothes were scanty; and Peter might have known, and very likely did, the inside of a pawnbroker’s. But, they were happy, grateful, pleased with one another, and contented with the time; and when they faded, and looked happier yet in the bright sprinklings of the Spirit’s torch at parting, Scrooge had his eye upon them, and especially on Tiny Tim, until the last.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "Scrooge felt ashamed and trembled under the Ghost's criticism, lowering his gaze to the floor. However, hearing his own name mentioned, he quickly looked up.\nBob spoke, \"Mr. Scrooge! Let's toast Mr. Scrooge, the person responsible for our meal!\"\n\"Responsible for the meal, indeed!\" exclaimed Mrs. Cratchit, blushing with anger. \"I wish he were here right now. I'd give him a piece of my mind to chew on, and I hope he'd have a good appetite for it!\"\n\"My dear,\" Bob gently interjected, \"the children are here! It's Christmas Day.\"\n\"It certainly should be Christmas Day,\" she retorted, \"when one drinks to the health of such a hateful, miserly, harsh, uncaring man as Mr. Scrooge. You know how he is, Robert! No one knows it better than you, poor fellow!\"\n\"My dear,\" Bob calmly replied again, \"Christmas Day.\"\n\"I'll drink his health for your sake and because it's the holiday,\" said Mrs. Cratchit, \"but not for his own. May he live long! Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year! He'll be extraordinarily merry and happy, I'm sure!\"\nThe children echoed the toast after her. It was the first part of their celebration that lacked genuine warmth. Tiny Tim drank it last and seemed completely indifferent. Scrooge was viewed as the family's villain. Just saying his name cast a gloom over the gathering that took a full five minutes to disappear.\nOnce the unpleasantness had lifted, they became ten times happier than before, simply relieved that the burdensome thought of Scrooge was gone. Bob Cratchit then shared news of a possible job he'd found for young Peter, which, if secured, would earn him a substantial five shillings and sixpence each week. The two youngest Cratchit children burst into loud laughter at the idea of Peter as a professional man, while Peter himself stared thoughtfully into the fire through his collar, as if contemplating the specific investments he'd choose with such a remarkable income. Martha, who worked as a poorly paid apprentice at a milliner's shop, then described her challenging work – the type it was, the long hours she worked continuously, and her intention to sleep in late the next morning to rest, since it was a holiday she'd spend at home. She also recounted seeing a countess and a lord a few days prior, mentioning that the lord \"was about as tall as Peter,\" prompting Peter to pull up his collar so high that, had you been there, you wouldn't have seen his head. Throughout this time, chestnuts and drinks circulated. Eventually, Tiny Tim, in his sweetly sad little voice, sang a song about a lost child in the snow, performing it quite well.\nThere was nothing particularly remarkable about them. They weren't an attractive family; they weren't dressed nicely; their shoes were far from waterproof; their clothing was thin; and Peter had likely been inside a pawn shop, and probably knew it well. But, they were happy, thankful, enjoyed each other's company, and were content with the moment. As they faded from view, appearing even happier in the bright light from the Spirit's torch as it departed, Scrooge kept his eyes fixed on them, and especially on Tiny Tim, until they were gone.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "Scrooge recoiled from the Spirit’s criticism and, shaken, looked down at the floor. But he quickly looked up again when he heard his name mentioned. \n\n“Mr. Scrooge!” said Bob. “Let’s toast Mr. Scrooge, the one who made this meal possible!” \n\n“That’s rich!” Mrs. Cratchit said, flushing with anger. “If only he were here, I’d give him a piece of my mind he could chew on — I hope he’d enjoy it!” \n\n“Please, dear,” Bob gently reminded her, gesturing to their children. “It’s Christmas.” \n\nMrs. Cratchit replied, “Yes, it’s Christmas, and that’s exactly the reason we have to drink to such a mean, heartless, cold man as Scrooge. You of all people know what he’s like, Robert!” \n\nBob only whispered again, “My dear, it’s Christmas.” \n\n“So I’ll drink to his health, for your sake and for Christmas, not for his,” Mrs. Cratchit said. “May he have a long life and a happy Christmas — although I’m sure it won’t make him any happier!” \n\nThe children all drank the toast, though they did so without any enthusiasm. Tiny Tim was the last to join in — and he couldn’t have cared less. Scrooge was like the family’s bogeyman; just hearing his name cast a pall over the celebration, which lingered for about five minutes.\n\nOnce the gloomy mood had lifted, the family was even more cheerful, glad to leave thoughts of Scrooge behind. Bob told them he might have found a job for Peter, which, if he got it, would pay five shillings and sixpence a week. The younger Cratchits were excited at the idea of Peter getting into business, and Peter, trying to act grown-up, stared into the fire as if planning how he’d invest his future earnings. Martha, learning to be a dressmaker, described the tough work and long hours she put in, and how she was looking forward to sleeping in on her day off. She also shared she'd seen a countess and a lord recently, and that the lord was about as tall as Peter—prompting Peter to pull his collars up as high as he could. \n\nThroughout all this, roasted chestnuts and a jug were passed around. Then Tiny Tim, with his delicate voice, sang a song about a lost child wandering in the snow, and he sang it beautifully.\n\nThere was nothing particularly remarkable about this family. They weren’t attractive, their clothes were shabby, their shoes leaked, and Peter probably knew what the inside of a pawnshop looked like. But they were joyful, grateful, enjoyed each other’s company, and made the most of their time together. As the scene faded and the family, illuminated by the Spirit’s glowing light, looked happier than ever, Scrooge kept his gaze fixed on them—especially on Tiny Tim—until they disappeared from sight."

          "text_segment": "By this time it was getting dark, and snowing pretty heavily; and as Scrooge and the Spirit went along the streets, the brightness of the roaring fires in kitchens, parlours, and all sorts of rooms, was wonderful. Here, the flickering of the blaze showed preparations for a cosy dinner, with hot plates baking through and through before the fire, and deep red curtains, ready to be drawn to shut out cold and darkness. There all the children of the house were running out into the snow to meet their married sisters, brothers, cousins, uncles, aunts, and be the first to greet them. Here, again, were shadows on the window-blind of guests assembling; and there a group of handsome girls, all hooded and fur-booted, and all chattering at once, tripped lightly off to some near neighbour’s house; where, woe upon the single man who saw them enter—artful witches, well they knew it—in a glow!\nBut, if you had judged from the numbers of people on their way to friendly gatherings, you might have thought that no one was at home to give them welcome when they got there, instead of every house expecting company, and piling up its fires half-chimney high. Blessings on it, how the Ghost exulted! How it bared its breadth of breast, and opened its capacious palm, and floated on, outpouring, with a generous hand, its bright and harmless mirth on everything within its reach! The very lamplighter, who ran on before, dotting the dusky street with specks of light, and who was dressed to spend the evening somewhere, laughed out loudly as the Spirit passed, though little kenned the lamplighter that he had any company but Christmas!\nAnd now, without a word of warning from the Ghost, they stood upon a bleak and desert moor, where monstrous masses of rude stone were cast about, as though it were the burial-place of giants; and water spread itself wheresoever it listed, or would have done so, but for the frost that held it prisoner; and nothing grew but moss and furze, and coarse rank grass. Down in the west the setting sun had left a streak of fiery red, which glared upon the desolation for an instant, like a sullen eye, and frowning lower, lower, lower yet, was lost in the thick gloom of darkest night.\n“What place is this?” asked Scrooge.\n“A place where Miners live, who labour in the bowels of the earth,” returned the Spirit. “But they know me. See!”\nA light shone from the window of a hut, and swiftly they advanced towards it. Passing through the wall of mud and stone, they found a cheerful company assembled round a glowing fire. An old, old man and woman, with their children and their children’s children, and another generation beyond that, all decked out gaily in their holiday attire. The old man, in a voice that seldom rose above the howling of the wind upon the barren waste, was singing them a Christmas song—it had been a very old song when he was a boy—and from time to time they all joined in the chorus. So surely as they raised their voices, the old man got quite blithe and loud; and so surely as they stopped, his vigour sank again.\nThe Spirit did not tarry here, but bade Scrooge hold his robe, and passing on above the moor, sped—whither? Not to sea? To sea. To Scrooge’s horror, looking back, he saw the last of the land, a frightful range of rocks, behind them; and his ears were deafened by the thundering of water, as it rolled and roared, and raged among the dreadful caverns it had worn, and fiercely tried to undermine the earth.\nBuilt upon a dismal reef of sunken rocks, some league or so from shore, on which the waters chafed and dashed, the wild year through, there stood a solitary lighthouse. Great heaps of sea-weed clung to its base, and storm-birds—born of the wind one might suppose, as sea-weed of the water—rose and fell about it, like the waves they skimmed.\nBut even here, two men who watched the light had made a fire, that through the loophole in the thick stone wall shed out a ray of brightness on the awful sea. Joining their horny hands over the rough table at which they sat, they wished each other Merry Christmas in their can of grog; and one of them: the elder, too, with his face all damaged and scarred with hard weather, as the figure-head of an old ship might be: struck up a sturdy song that was like a Gale in itself.\nAgain the Ghost sped on, above the black and heaving sea—on, on—until, being far away, as he told Scrooge, from any shore, they lighted on a ship. They stood beside the helmsman at the wheel, the look-out in the bow, the officers who had the watch; dark, ghostly figures in their several stations; but every man among them hummed a Christmas tune, or had a Christmas thought, or spoke below his breath to his companion of some bygone Christmas Day, with homeward hopes belonging to it. And every man on board, waking or sleeping, good or bad, had had a kinder word for another on that day than on any day in the year; and had shared to some extent in its festivities; and had remembered those he cared for at a distance, and had known that they delighted to remember him.\nIt was a great surprise to Scrooge, while listening to the moaning of the wind, and thinking what a solemn thing it was to move on through the lonely darkness over an unknown abyss, whose depths were secrets as profound as Death: it was a great surprise to Scrooge, while thus engaged, to hear a hearty laugh. It was a much greater surprise to Scrooge to recognise it as his own nephew’s and to find himself in a bright, dry, gleaming room, with the Spirit standing smiling by his side, and looking at that same nephew with approving affability!\n“Ha, ha!” laughed Scrooge’s nephew. “Ha, ha, ha!”\nIf you should happen, by any unlikely chance, to know a man more blest in a laugh than Scrooge’s nephew, all I can say is, I should like to know him too. Introduce him to me, and I’ll cultivate his acquaintance.\nIt is a fair, even-handed, noble adjustment of things, that while there is infection in disease and sorrow, there is nothing in the world so irresistibly contagious as laughter and good-humour. When Scrooge’s nephew laughed in this way: holding his sides, rolling his head, and twisting his face into the most extravagant contortions: Scrooge’s niece, by marriage, laughed as heartily as he. And their assembled friends being not a bit behindhand, roared out lustily.\n“Ha, ha! Ha, ha, ha, ha!”\n“He said that Christmas was a humbug, as I live!” cried Scrooge’s nephew. “He believed it too!”\n“More shame for him, Fred!” said Scrooge’s niece, indignantly. Bless those women; they never do anything by halves. They are always in earnest.\nShe was very pretty: exceedingly pretty. With a dimpled, surprised-looking, capital face; a ripe little mouth, that seemed made to be kissed—as no doubt it was; all kinds of good little dots about her chin, that melted into one another when she laughed; and the sunniest pair of eyes you ever saw in any little creature’s head. Altogether she was what you would have called provoking, you know; but satisfactory, too. Oh, perfectly satisfactory.\n“He’s a comical old fellow,” said Scrooge’s nephew, “that’s the truth: and not so pleasant as he might be. However, his offences carry their own punishment, and I have nothing to say against him.”\n“I’m sure he is very rich, Fred,” hinted Scrooge’s niece. “At least you always tell me so.”\n“What of that, my dear!” said Scrooge’s nephew. “His wealth is of no use to him. He don’t do any good with it. He don’t make himself comfortable with it. He hasn’t the satisfaction of thinking—ha, ha, ha!—that he is ever going to benefit US with it.”\n“I have no patience with him,” observed Scrooge’s niece. Scrooge’s niece’s sisters, and all the other ladies, expressed the same opinion.\n“Oh, I have!” said Scrooge’s nephew. “I am sorry for him; I couldn’t be angry with him if I tried. Who suffers by his ill whims! Himself, always. Here, he takes it into his head to dislike us, and he won’t come and dine with us. What’s the consequence? He don’t lose much of a dinner.”\n“Indeed, I think he loses a very good dinner,” interrupted Scrooge’s niece. Everybody else said the same, and they must be allowed to have been competent judges, because they had just had dinner; and, with the dessert upon the table, were clustered round the fire, by lamplight.\n“Well! I’m very glad to hear it,” said Scrooge’s nephew, “because I haven’t great faith in these young housekeepers. What do you say, Topper?”\nTopper had clearly got his eye upon one of Scrooge’s niece’s sisters, for he answered that a bachelor was a wretched outcast, who had no right to express an opinion on the subject. Whereat Scrooge’s niece’s sister—the plump one with the lace tucker: not the one with the roses—blushed.\n“Do go on, Fred,” said Scrooge’s niece, clapping her hands. “He never finishes what he begins to say! He is such a ridiculous fellow!”\nScrooge’s nephew revelled in another laugh, and as it was impossible to keep the infection off; though the plump sister tried hard to do it with aromatic vinegar; his example was unanimously followed.\n“I was only going to say,” said Scrooge’s nephew, “that the consequence of his taking a dislike to us, and not making merry with us, is, as I think, that he loses some pleasant moments, which could do him no harm. I am sure he loses pleasanter companions than he can find in his own thoughts, either in his mouldy old office, or his dusty chambers. I mean to give him the same chance every year, whether he likes it or not, for I pity him. He may rail at Christmas till he dies, but he can’t help thinking better of it—I defy him—if he finds me going there, in good temper, year after year, and saying Uncle Scrooge, how are you? If it only puts him in the vein to leave his poor clerk fifty pounds, that’s something; and I think I shook him yesterday.”\nIt was their turn to laugh now at the notion of his shaking Scrooge. But being thoroughly good-natured, and not much caring what they laughed at, so that they laughed at any rate, he encouraged them in their merriment, and passed the bottle joyously.\nAfter tea, they had some music. For they were a musical family, and knew what they were about, when they sung a Glee or Catch, I can assure you: especially Topper, who could growl away in the bass like a good one, and never swell the large veins in his forehead, or get red in the face over it. Scrooge’s niece played well upon the harp; and played among other tunes a simple little air (a mere nothing: you might learn to whistle it in two minutes), which had been familiar to the child who fetched Scrooge from the boarding-school, as he had been reminded by the Ghost of Christmas Past. When this strain of music sounded, all the things that Ghost had shown him, came upon his mind; he softened more and more; and thought that if he could have listened to it often, years ago, he might have cultivated the kindnesses of life for his own happiness with his own hands, without resorting to the sexton’s spade that buried Jacob Marley.\nBut they didn’t devote the whole evening to music. After a while they played at forfeits; for it is good to be children sometimes, and never better than at Christmas, when its mighty Founder was a child himself. Stop! There was first a game at blind-man’s buff. Of course there was. And I no more believe Topper was really blind than I believe he had eyes in his boots. My opinion is, that it was a done thing between him and Scrooge’s nephew; and that the Ghost of Christmas Present knew it. The way he went after that plump sister in the lace tucker, was an outrage on the credulity of human nature. Knocking down the fire-irons, tumbling over the chairs, bumping against the piano, smothering himself among the curtains, wherever she went, there went he! He always knew where the plump sister was. He wouldn’t catch anybody else. If you had fallen up against him (as some of them did), on purpose, he would have made a feint of endeavouring to seize you, which would have been an affront to your understanding, and would instantly have sidled off in the direction of the plump sister. She often cried out that it wasn’t fair; and it really was not. But when at last, he caught her; when, in spite of all her silken rustlings, and her rapid flutterings past him, he got her into a corner whence there was no escape; then his conduct was the most execrable. For his pretending not to know her; his pretending that it was necessary to touch her head-dress, and further to assure himself of her identity by pressing a certain ring upon her finger, and a certain chain about her neck; was vile, monstrous! No doubt she told him her opinion of it, when, another blind-man being in office, they were so very confidential together, behind the curtains.\nScrooge’s niece was not one of the blind-man’s buff party, but was made comfortable with a large chair and a footstool, in a snug corner, where the Ghost and Scrooge were close behind her. But she joined in the forfeits, and loved her love to admiration with all the letters of the alphabet. Likewise at the game of How, When, and Where, she was very great, and to the secret joy of Scrooge’s nephew, beat her sisters hollow: though they were sharp girls too, as Topper could have told you. There might have been twenty people there, young and old, but they all played, and so did Scrooge; for wholly forgetting in the interest he had in what was going on, that his voice made no sound in their ears, he sometimes came out with his guess quite loud, and very often guessed quite right, too; for the sharpest needle, best Whitechapel, warranted not to cut in the eye, was not sharper than Scrooge; blunt as he took it in his head to be.\nThe Ghost was greatly pleased to find him in this mood, and looked upon him with such favour, that he begged like a boy to be allowed to stay until the guests departed. But this the Spirit said could not be done.\n“Here is a new game,” said Scrooge. “One half hour, Spirit, only one!”\nIt was a Game called Yes and No, where Scrooge’s nephew had to think of something, and the rest must find out what; he only answering to their questions yes or no, as the case was. The brisk fire of questioning to which he was exposed, elicited from him that he was thinking of an animal, a live animal, rather a disagreeable animal, a savage animal, an animal that growled and grunted sometimes, and talked sometimes, and lived in London, and walked about the streets, and wasn’t made a show of, and wasn’t led by anybody, and didn’t live in a menagerie, and was never killed in a market, and was not a horse, or an ass, or a cow, or a bull, or a tiger, or a dog, or a pig, or a cat, or a bear. At every fresh question that was put to him, this nephew burst into a fresh roar of laughter; and was so inexpressibly tickled, that he was obliged to get up off the sofa and stamp. At last the plump sister, falling into a similar state, cried out:\n“I have found it out! I know what it is, Fred! I know what it is!”\n“What is it?” cried Fred.\n“It’s your Uncle Scro-o-o-o-oge!”\nWhich it certainly was. Admiration was the universal sentiment, though some objected that the reply to “Is it a bear?” ought to have been “Yes;” inasmuch as an answer in the negative was sufficient to have diverted their thoughts from Mr. Scrooge, supposing they had ever had any tendency that way.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "By this time, evening had settled, and the snow was quite heavy. As Scrooge and the Spirit journeyed through the streets, the sight of blazing fires radiating warmth from kitchens, living rooms, and various other chambers was truly remarkable. In one place, the flickering flames illuminated preparations for a comfortable dinner, with hot plates warming thoroughly by the fire, and thick red curtains poised to block out the cold and darkness. Elsewhere, all the children dashed out into the snow to greet their arriving married siblings, cousins, aunts, and uncles, eager to be the first to welcome them. Further on, shadows were cast on window blinds by assembling guests; and over there, a group of lovely young women, dressed in hoods and fur boots, all chattering excitedly, quickly set off for a nearby neighbor’s house. It would be a pity for any single man who saw them enter – cunning enchantresses, they were well aware of their effect – shining with happiness! It seemed, judging by the sheer number of people heading to social gatherings, that you might assume no one was home to receive them upon arrival, rather than every house expecting company and building fires up nearly to the chimney top. How the Ghost rejoiced in this! How it expanded its chest and opened its large hand, gliding along and generously scattering its bright and harmless cheer on everything within reach! Even the lamplighter, running ahead to dot the darkening street with points of light, and clearly dressed for an evening out, laughed loudly as the Spirit passed, though the lamplighter had no idea he had any companion besides the spirit of Christmas itself! And then, without any warning from the Ghost, they found themselves on a bleak and desolate moor. Here lay immense, rough stones scattered about, as if marking a burial ground for giants. Water spread wherever it pleased, or would have, had the frost not held it captive. Nothing grew except moss, furze, and coarse, rough grass. In the west, the setting sun had left a fiery red streak that glared upon the emptiness for a moment, like a resentful eye, and sinking lower and lower, was eventually swallowed by the thick gloom of deepest night. “What place is this?” Scrooge inquired. “This is where Miners live, who toil deep within the earth,” the Spirit replied. “But they know me. Look!” A light appeared from a hut window, and they rapidly moved towards it. Passing through the mud and stone wall, they discovered a cheerful group gathered around a warm fire. There was a very old man and woman, with their children, their children’s children, and even a generation beyond that, all dressed cheerfully in their holiday clothes. The old man, his voice rarely louder than the wind howling across the barren landscape, was singing them a Christmas song—a tune that was ancient even when he was a boy—and from time to time, everyone joined in the chorus. As certainly as they raised their voices, the old man became quite joyful and loud; and just as surely, when they stopped, his energy waned again. The Spirit did not linger here, but instructed Scrooge to hold his robe, and speeding on above the moor, went—where? Not to sea? Yes, to sea. To Scrooge’s dismay, looking back, he saw the last trace of land vanish behind them, a fearsome line of rocks. His ears were filled with the deafening roar of water, as it crashed and surged and raged against the terrible caverns it had carved, fiercely attempting to erode the land. Situated on a dreary reef of submerged rocks, perhaps a mile or so from the coast, where the waves constantly churned and broke throughout the year, stood a solitary lighthouse. Large clumps of seaweed clung to its base, and storm-birds—appearing as if born from the wind, like seaweed from the water—rose and fell around it, mirroring the waves they skimmed. But even here, the two men who kept the light had made a fire that sent a beam of brightness through the narrow opening in the thick stone wall, out onto the formidable sea. Clasping their calloused hands over the rough table where they sat, they wished each other a Merry Christmas while sharing a can of grog. One of them, the older man, his face marked and weathered like the figurehead of an ancient ship, began a robust song as powerful as a storm itself. Again, the Ghost sped on, over the dark, surging sea—on and on—until, as he informed Scrooge, they were far from any shore, and they landed on a ship. They stood beside the helmsman steering, the look-out in the bow, and the officers on watch. They appeared as dark, spectral figures at their posts. Yet, every man among them hummed a Christmas tune, or held a Christmas thought, or quietly spoke to his companion of a past Christmas Day, along with hopes of returning home. And every man on board, whether awake or asleep, good or bad, had offered a kinder word to another on that day than on any other throughout the year; and each had participated in the festivities to some degree; and all had remembered loved ones far away, knowing they were likewise remembered. It was a great surprise to Scrooge, while listening to the wind’s mournful sound and contemplating the gravity of moving through the lonely darkness over an unknown chasm whose depths were as profound as death itself; it was a great surprise to Scrooge, while occupied with these thoughts, to hear a cheerful laugh. It was a much greater surprise to Scrooge to recognize it as his own nephew’s and to find himself in a well-lit, warm, gleaming room, with the Spirit standing smiling beside him, regarding that same nephew with approving warmth! “Ha, ha!” Scrooge’s nephew laughed. “Ha, ha, ha!” If by some unlikely chance you happen to know a man blessed with a more joyful laugh than Scrooge’s nephew, all I can say is I would very much like to meet him too. Introduce him to me, and I will seek his acquaintance. It is a just, equitable, and noble aspect of life that while illness and sorrow are contagious, nothing in the world is as utterly infectious as laughter and good humor. When Scrooge’s nephew laughed like this—holding his sides, shaking his head, and twisting his face into the most exaggerated expressions—Scrooge’s niece by marriage laughed just as heartily. And their assembled friends, not to be outdone, roared with laughter. “Ha, ha! Ha, ha, ha, ha!” “He said that Christmas was nonsense, as I live!” cried Scrooge’s nephew. “He truly believed it!” “More shame on him, Fred!” said Scrooge’s niece indignantly. Bless those women; they never do things halfway. They are always sincere. She was very pretty, exceptionally pretty. With a lovely, dimpled, surprised-looking face; a perfect little mouth that seemed made for kissing—as it surely was; all sorts of delightful little features around her chin that blended together when she laughed; and the most radiant eyes you ever saw in any small creature’s head. In short, she was what you might call charmingly irritating, you know; but also deeply satisfying. Oh, perfectly satisfying. “He’s a peculiar old fellow,” said Scrooge’s nephew, “that’s the truth, and not as pleasant as he could be. However, his faults bring their own consequences, and I have nothing negative to say about him.” “I’m sure he is very wealthy, Fred,” hinted Scrooge’s niece. “At least, that’s what you always tell me.” “What does that matter, my dear!” said Scrooge’s nephew. “His wealth is useless to him. He doesn’t do any good with it. He doesn’t use it to make himself comfortable. He doesn’t have the pleasure of thinking—ha, ha, ha!—that he is ever going to benefit US with it.” “I have no patience for him,” commented Scrooge’s niece. Scrooge’s niece’s sisters and all the other ladies present shared this opinion. “Oh, but I do!” said Scrooge’s nephew. “I feel sorry for him; I couldn’t be angry with him even if I tried. Who suffers from his bad moods? Always himself. Here, he decides he dislikes us and refuses to come dine with us. What’s the result? He doesn’t lose much of a dinner.” “Indeed, I think he loses a very good dinner,” Scrooge’s niece interjected. Everyone else agreed, and they should certainly be considered reliable judges, as they had just finished dinner and were gathered around the fire by lamplight, with dessert still on the table. “Well! I’m very pleased to hear it,” said Scrooge’s nephew, “because I don’t have much confidence in these young women running households. What do you think, Topper?” Topper clearly had his eye on one of Scrooge’s niece’s sisters, for he responded that a bachelor was a miserable outcast with no right to offer an opinion on the matter. At this, Scrooge’s niece’s sister—the curvy one with the lace neckline, not the one with the roses—blushed. “Please continue, Fred,” said Scrooge’s niece, clapping her hands. “He never finishes what he starts to say! He is such a silly person!” Scrooge’s nephew indulged in another fit of laughter, and as it was impossible to resist the contagion—though the plump sister tried hard to counteract it with smelling salts—his example was universally followed. “I was only going to say,” said Scrooge’s nephew, “that the consequence of his disliking us and not enjoying himself with us is, in my opinion, that he misses out on some pleasant moments that could do him no harm. I am sure he misses more enjoyable company than he can find in his own thoughts, whether in his musty old office or his dusty rooms. I intend to offer him the same opportunity every year, whether he likes it or not, because I pity him. He can complain about Christmas until he dies, but he can’t help but feel better about it—I challenge him—if he sees me coming here, in good spirits, year after year, and saying, ‘Uncle Scrooge, how are you?’ If that only prompts him to leave his poor clerk fifty pounds, that would be worthwhile; and I think I might have nudged him yesterday.” It was now their turn to laugh at the idea of him ",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "As evening approached, the snow was falling thickly, making the streets grow dark. Scrooge and the Spirit walked onward, passing homes that were bright with the glow of fires in kitchens and parlors, giving everything a festive feeling. Some of these fires illuminated scenes of families preparing comforting dinners, with plates warming by the fireplace and rich curtains ready to be drawn for warmth. Children rushed out to welcome visiting relatives, and through windows they could see guests arriving and young women bundled up in winter clothes setting out to visit friends—much to the dismay of unattached men who watched them go by. The streets were full of people heading out for gatherings, making it seem as if every home was expecting company and piling their fires high in welcome. The Ghost delighted in all of this, spreading joy everywhere it went; even the lamplighter, going about his work and dressed for an evening out, laughed aloud as the Spirit passed him, not knowing he had any companion but Christmas itself."

Uncle Scrooge!” they cried.\n“A Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year to the old man, whatever he is!” said Scrooge’s nephew. “He wouldn’t take it from me, but may he have it, nevertheless. Uncle Scrooge!”\nUncle Scrooge had imperceptibly become so gay and light of heart, that he would have pledged the unconscious company in return, and thanked them in an inaudible speech, if the Ghost had given him time. But the whole scene passed off in the breath of the last word spoken by his nephew; and he and the Spirit were again upon their travels.\nMuch they saw, and far they went, and many homes they visited, but always with a happy end. The Spirit stood beside sick beds, and they were cheerful; on foreign lands, and they were close at home; by struggling men, and they were patient in their greater hope; by poverty, and it was rich. In almshouse, hospital, and jail, in misery’s every refuge, where vain man in his little brief authority had not made fast the door, and barred the Spirit out, he left his blessing, and taught Scrooge his precepts.\nIt was a long night, if it were only a night; but Scrooge had his doubts of this, because the Christmas Holidays appeared to be condensed into the space of time they passed together. It was strange, too, that while Scrooge remained unaltered in his outward form, the Ghost grew older, clearly older. Scrooge had observed this change, but never spoke of it, until they left a children’s Twelfth Night party, when, looking at the Spirit as they stood together in an open place, he noticed that its hair was grey.\n“Are spirits’ lives so short?” asked Scrooge.\n“My life upon this globe, is very brief,” replied the Ghost. “It ends to-night.”\n“To-night!” cried Scrooge.\n“To-night at midnight. Hark! The time is drawing near.”\nThe chimes were ringing the three quarters past eleven at that moment.\n“Forgive me if I am not justified in what I ask,” said Scrooge, looking intently at the Spirit’s robe, “but I see something strange, and not belonging to yourself, protruding from your skirts. Is it a foot or a claw?”\n“It might be a claw, for the flesh there is upon it,” was the Spirit’s sorrowful reply. “Look here.”\nFrom the foldings of its robe, it brought two children; wretched, abject, frightful, hideous, miserable. They knelt down at its feet, and clung upon the outside of its garment.\n“Oh, Man! look here. Look, look, down here!” exclaimed the Ghost.\nThey were a boy and girl. Yellow, meagre, ragged, scowling, wolfish; but prostrate, too, in their humility. Where graceful youth should have filled their features out, and touched them with its freshest tints, a stale and shrivelled hand, like that of age, had pinched, and twisted them, and pulled them into shreds. Where angels might have sat enthroned, devils lurked, and glared out menacing. No change, no degradation, no perversion of humanity, in any grade, through all the mysteries of wonderful creation, has monsters half so horrible and dread.\nScrooge started back, appalled. Having them shown to him in this way, he tried to say they were fine children, but the words choked themselves, rather than be parties to a lie of such enormous magnitude.\n“Spirit! are they yours?” Scrooge could say no more.\n“They are Man’s,” said the Spirit, looking down upon them. “And they cling to me, appealing from their fathers. This boy is Ignorance. This girl is Want. Beware them both, and all of their degree, but most of all beware this boy, for on his brow I see that written which is Doom, unless the writing be erased. Deny it!” cried the Spirit, stretching out its hand towards the city. “Slander those who tell it ye! Admit it for your factious purposes, and make it worse. And bide the end!”\n“Have they no refuge or resource?” cried Scrooge.\n“Are there no prisons?” said the Spirit, turning on him for the last time with his own words. “Are there no workhouses?”\nThe bell struck twelve.\nScrooge looked about him for the Ghost, and saw it not. As the last stroke ceased to vibrate, he remembered the prediction of old Jacob Marley, and lifting up his eyes, beheld a solemn Phantom, draped and hooded, coming, like a mist along the ground, towards him.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "Fred declared Scrooge had certainly provided plenty of cheer and it would be ungrateful not to toast his health. He noted they had mulled wine ready and proposed, 'Uncle Scrooge!' The others enthusiastically echoed, 'Well! Uncle Scrooge!' Scrooge's nephew wished the old man a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year, adding that even though Scrooge wouldn't accept it from him, he hoped he would receive it nonetheless. He repeated, 'Uncle Scrooge!' Scrooge, without realizing it, had become so happy and lighthearted that, had the Ghost allowed, he would have raised a glass in return to the unsuspecting group and offered silent thanks. However, the entire scene dissolved the instant his nephew finished speaking, and he and the Spirit were back on their travels. They saw a great deal, travelled widely, and visited many homes, but always encountered happiness. The Spirit brought cheer to sickbeds, made foreign lands feel familiar, gave patience and greater hope to struggling individuals, and found richness in poverty. In places of suffering like almshouses, hospitals, and jails, essentially every refuge where cruel people in their brief power hadn't managed to completely shut out hope and the Spirit, he bestowed blessings and taught Scrooge valuable lessons. It felt like a very long night, if indeed it was just a single night; Scrooge had doubts, as the Christmas season seemed to have been compressed into the short time they spent together. It was also strange that while Scrooge's outward appearance remained unchanged, the Ghost was visibly growing older, clearly older. Scrooge noticed this aging but said nothing until after leaving a children's Twelfth Night party. Standing with the Spirit in an open area, he observed that its hair had turned grey. 'Are spirits' lives so short?' Scrooge asked. The Ghost replied, 'My life on this earth is very brief. It ends tonight.' 'Tonight!' Scrooge exclaimed. 'Tonight at midnight. Listen! The hour is drawing near.' At that moment, the church bells chimed the three quarters past eleven. 'Forgive me if I'm asking improperly,' Scrooge said, staring intently at the Spirit's robe, 'but I see something odd, something that doesn't seem part of you, sticking out from the bottom of your clothing. Is it a foot or a claw?' 'It might resemble a claw because of the skin on it,' the Spirit replied sorrowfully. 'Look here.' From the folds of its robe, it revealed two children, who looked wretched, degraded, terrifying, hideous, and miserable. They sank to their knees at the Spirit's feet and clung to the outside of its garment. 'Oh, Humanity! Look here. Look, look, down here!' cried the Ghost. They were a boy and a girl. They were yellow, thin, in rags, scowling, and wolf-like, yet also humble and submissive. Instead of the smooth features and fresh colours of graceful youth, their faces had been pinched, twisted, and worn down like an old person's by a harsh, withered hand. Where angels might have rightfully belonged, devils lurked and glared out threateningly. No other transformation, degradation, or distortion of humanity at any level, throughout all of wonderful creation's mysteries, could produce monsters half as dreadful and terrifying. Scrooge recoiled in horror. Having been shown them this way, he tried to say they were fine children, but the lie was so enormous it caught in his throat. 'Spirit! Are they yours?' Scrooge could say no more. 'They belong to Mankind,' the Spirit said, looking down at them. 'And they cling to me, seeking refuge from their fathers. This boy is Ignorance. This girl is Want. Beware them both, and everyone like them, but most of all beware this boy, for on his forehead I see written something that means Doom, unless that writing is erased. Deny it!' cried the Spirit, pointing towards the city. 'Slander those who warn you! Welcome it for your selfish gain, and make it worse. And await the outcome!' 'Do they have no shelter or help?' Scrooge cried out. 'Are there no prisons?' the Spirit replied, using Scrooge's own words against him for the last time as it turned towards him. 'Are there no workhouses?' The bell struck twelve. Scrooge looked around for the Ghost, but it was gone. As the final chime faded, he remembered old Jacob Marley's prediction and, looking up, saw a solemn, draped, and hooded Phantom approaching him across the ground like a mist.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "Fred remarked that Scrooge had brought them much cheer, and it would be wrong not to toast him. With a glass of hot wine, Fred raised it, saying, 'Uncle Scrooge!' The others echoed him. Scrooge’s nephew wished his uncle a merry Christmas and happy New Year, even though Scrooge would not accept it personally, hoping he’d receive it all the same. Unseen, Scrooge was filled with unexpected joy, and would have gladly returned the toast and given thanks if the Ghost had allowed it. However, no sooner had the nephew finished speaking than the scene vanished, and Scrooge and the Ghost found themselves traveling again. They saw many things—visited numerous homes—and wherever they went, things ended happily. The Spirit stood by the ill and brought cheer, appeared in distant lands but made all feel at home, comforted the struggling and the poor, turning sorrowful places into scenes of hope. Wherever there was need—in almshouses, hospitals, prisons—if pride had not barred the way, the Spirit left blessings and taught Scrooge lessons. \n\nThe night felt endlessly long, compressed with Christmases, though Scrooge wondered at this, since his form didn’t age, yet the Ghost visibly did, growing older. Scrooge finally commented on this after they left a children’s party; he noticed the Spirit’s hair had turned gray. When he asked if spirits’ lives were so short, the Ghost replied its life would end that very night at midnight, and the clock already struck quarter to midnight. \n\nScrooge then noticed something strange protruding from the Spirit’s robe—perhaps a foot or a claw. The Ghost sorrowfully revealed two miserable, wretched children clinging to him—a boy and a girl, sickly and degraded, robbed of the freshness of youth, their features twisted into something terrifying. No corruption of humanity could match their horror. Scrooge recoiled, horrified, and could not bring himself to offer false comfort. \n\nHe asked if the children belonged to the Spirit, who replied they were Man’s: the boy was called Ignorance, the girl, Want. The Spirit warned Scrooge to beware them both, especially the boy, for doom was written on his brow unless things changed. The Spirit urged Scrooge not to deny their existence or make their plight worse by ignoring it. \n\nWhen Scrooge asked if there was nowhere for them to go, the Spirit threw Scrooge’s earlier words back at him: were there not prisons or workhouses? As the bell tolled midnight, the Ghost vanished. Remembering Marley’s warning, Scrooge looked up to see a solemn, shrouded Phantom gliding toward him across the ground."

When it came near him, Scrooge bent down upon his knee; for in the very air through which this Spirit moved it seemed to scatter gloom and mystery.\nIt was shrouded in a deep black garment, which concealed its head, its face, its form, and left nothing of it visible save one outstretched hand. But for this it would have been difficult to detach its figure from the night, and separate it from the darkness by which it was surrounded.\nHe felt that it was tall and stately when it came beside him, and that its mysterious presence filled him with a solemn dread. He knew no more, for the Spirit neither spoke nor moved.\n“I am in the presence of the Ghost of Christmas Yet To Come?” said Scrooge.\nThe Spirit answered not, but pointed onward with its hand.\n“You are about to show me shadows of the things that have not happened, but will happen in the time before us,” Scrooge pursued. “Is that so, Spirit?”\nThe upper portion of the garment was contracted for an instant in its folds, as if the Spirit had inclined its head. That was the only answer he received.\nAlthough well used to ghostly company by this time, Scrooge feared the silent shape so much that his legs trembled beneath him, and he found that he could hardly stand when he prepared to follow it. The Spirit paused a moment, as observing his condition, and giving him time to recover.\nBut Scrooge was all the worse for this. It thrilled him with a vague uncertain horror, to know that behind the dusky shroud, there were ghostly eyes intently fixed upon him, while he, though he stretched his own to the utmost, could see nothing but a spectral hand and one great heap of black.\n“Ghost of the Future!” he exclaimed, “I fear you more than any spectre I have seen. But as I know your purpose is to do me good, and as I hope to live to be another man from what I was, I am prepared to bear you company, and do it with a thankful heart. Will you not speak to me?”\nIt gave him no reply. The hand was pointed straight before them.\n“Lead on!” said Scrooge. “Lead on! The night is waning fast, and it is precious time to me, I know. Lead on, Spirit!”\nThe Phantom moved away as it had come towards him. Scrooge followed in the shadow of its dress, which bore him up, he thought, and carried him along.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "The spectral figure drew near slowly, solemnly, and without a sound. As it approached, Scrooge dropped to his knees, feeling that the very air around this spirit seemed to emit an aura of darkness and mystery. It was enveloped in a heavy black robe that hid its head, face, and entire form, leaving only a single hand extended. Without this hand, it would have been nearly impossible to distinguish its shape from the surrounding night and the darkness that enveloped it. He sensed that it was tall and imposing as it stood beside him, and its mysterious presence filled him with profound fear. He understood nothing further, as the spirit neither spoke nor moved. \"Am I now confronting the Ghost of Christmas Future?\" Scrooge asked. The spirit remained silent, merely pointing forward with its hand. \"You are intending to reveal to me visions of events that have not yet occurred, but are destined to happen in the time ahead,\" Scrooge continued. \"Is that correct, Spirit?\" For a moment, the upper part of the robe seemed to contract in its folds, as if the spirit had slightly bowed its head. This was the only response he received. Although he had grown accustomed to encountering spirits by this point, Scrooge was so terrified by the silent form that his legs trembled beneath him, making it difficult for him to stand as he prepared to follow. The spirit paused briefly, appearing to notice his state and allowing him time to regain his composure. However, this only made Scrooge feel worse. It filled him with a vague, unsettling dread to know that behind the dark shroud, ghostly eyes were intently fixed upon him, while he, despite straining his own eyes to the utmost, could see nothing but a spectral hand and a large mass of black fabric. \"Ghost of the Future!\" he exclaimed, \"I fear you more than any ghost I have encountered. But because I understand your purpose is to guide me positively, and I hope to live a changed man, I am ready to accompany you and do so with a grateful heart. Will you not speak to me?\" It offered him no reply. The hand remained pointed directly ahead. \"Lead on!\" Scrooge urged. \"Lead on! The night is passing quickly, and I know this time is precious to me. Lead on, Spirit!\" The spectral figure moved away just as it had approached. Scrooge followed closely in the shadow of its attire, feeling as though it supported and carried him along.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "The Ghost slowly and gravely approached Scrooge in silence. As it neared him, Scrooge knelt, feeling that the air around the Spirit seemed to spread darkness and mystery. The figure was hidden under a long black robe, which covered its head, face, and body, leaving only one hand visible. Without this hand, it would have blended completely into the darkness. Standing close to the Spirit, Scrooge sensed its imposing height and dignified presence, and he was overcome with a solemn fear, for the Spirit did not speak or move. \n\nScrooge asked, \"Am I in the presence of the Ghost of Christmas Yet To Come?\" The Spirit remained silent and merely pointed ahead with its hand. Scrooge continued, \"You mean to show me visions of events that haven't happened yet, but will?\" The upper part of the Spirit's cloak shifted slightly, as if it nodded, but offered no further reply. Although Scrooge had grown used to encountering ghosts, he was so frightened by the silent figure that his legs shook and he could barely stand to follow it. The Spirit paused as if waiting for him to regain his composure.\n\nHowever, Scrooge felt even worse; a chilling, uncertain fear came over him at the thought that, behind the dark shroud, ghostly eyes were watching him, while he could only see the pale hand and the mass of darkness. \"Ghost of the Future!\" he cried, \"I fear you more than any spirit I've met. But since I know your purpose is to help me, and I want to change my ways, I am willing to follow you with gratitude. Will you not speak to me?\" The Spirit did not answer, simply pointing ahead. \"Lead on!\" said Scrooge. \"Lead on! The night is passing quickly, and I know this time is valuable. Lead on, Spirit!\" The Phantom moved forward as it had approached, and Scrooge followed, feeling as though the Spirit's robe lifted and carried him along."

          "text_segment": "They scarcely seemed to enter the city; for the city rather seemed to spring up about them, and encompass them of its own act. But there they were, in the heart of it; on ’Change, amongst the merchants; who hurried up and down, and chinked the money in their pockets, and conversed in groups, and looked at their watches, and trifled thoughtfully with their great gold seals; and so forth, as Scrooge had seen them often.\nThe Spirit stopped beside one little knot of business men. Observing that the hand was pointed to them, Scrooge advanced to listen to their talk.\n“No,” said a great fat man with a monstrous chin, “I don’t know much about it, either way. I only know he’s dead.”\n“When did he die?” inquired another.\n“Last night, I believe.”\n“Why, what was the matter with him?” asked a third, taking a vast quantity of snuff out of a very large snuff-box. “I thought he’d never die.”\n“God knows,” said the first, with a yawn.\n“What has he done with his money?” asked a red-faced gentleman with a pendulous excrescence on the end of his nose, that shook like the gills of a turkey-cock.\n“I haven’t heard,” said the man with the large chin, yawning again. “Left it to his company, perhaps. He hasn’t left it to me. That’s all I know.”\nThis pleasantry was received with a general laugh.\n“It’s likely to be a very cheap funeral,” said the same speaker; “for upon my life I don’t know of anybody to go to it. Suppose we make up a party and volunteer?”\n“I don’t mind going if a lunch is provided,” observed the gentleman with the excrescence on his nose. “But I must be fed, if I make one.”\nAnother laugh.\n“Well, I am the most disinterested among you, after all,” said the first speaker, “for I never wear black gloves, and I never eat lunch. But I’ll offer to go, if anybody else will. When I come to think of it, I’m not at all sure that I wasn’t his most particular friend; for we used to stop and speak whenever we met. Bye, bye!”\nSpeakers and listeners strolled away, and mixed with other groups. Scrooge knew the men, and looked towards the Spirit for an explanation.\nThe Phantom glided on into a street. Its finger pointed to two persons meeting. Scrooge listened again, thinking that the explanation might lie here.\nHe knew these men, also, perfectly. They were men of business: very wealthy, and of great importance. He had made a point always of standing well in their esteem: in a business point of view, that is; strictly in a business point of view.\n“How are you?” said one.\n“How are you?” returned the other.\n“Well!” said the first. “Old Scratch has got his own at last, hey?”\n“So I am told,” returned the second. “Cold, isn’t it?”\n“Seasonable for Christmas time. You’re not a skater, I suppose?”\n“No. No. Something else to think of. Good morning!”\nNot another word. That was their meeting, their conversation, and their parting.\nScrooge was at first inclined to be surprised that the Spirit should attach importance to conversations apparently so trivial; but feeling assured that they must have some hidden purpose, he set himself to consider what it was likely to be. They could scarcely be supposed to have any bearing on the death of Jacob, his old partner, for that was Past, and this Ghost’s province was the Future. Nor could he think of any one immediately connected with himself, to whom he could apply them. But nothing doubting that to whomsoever they applied they had some latent moral for his own improvement, he resolved to treasure up every word he heard, and everything he saw; and especially to observe the shadow of himself when it appeared. For he had an expectation that the conduct of his future self would give him the clue he missed, and would render the solution of these riddles easy.\nHe looked about in that very place for his own image; but another man stood in his accustomed corner, and though the clock pointed to his usual time of day for being there, he saw no likeness of himself among the multitudes that poured in through the Porch. It gave him little surprise, however; for he had been revolving in his mind a change of life, and thought and hoped he saw his new-born resolutions carried out in this.\nQuiet and dark, beside him stood the Phantom, with its outstretched hand. When he roused himself from his thoughtful quest, he fancied from the turn of the hand, and its situation in reference to himself, that the Unseen Eyes were looking at him keenly. It made him shudder, and feel very cold.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "They didn't so much feel like they entered the city; it was more as if the city spontaneously arose around them and enclosed them. But they were definitely there, in its core, on the stock exchange, among the merchants. These merchants were rushing back and forth, their money jingling in their pockets, chatting in small groups, checking their watches, and pensively toying with their large gold watch fobs, just as Scrooge had frequently observed them. The Spirit paused next to a small group of businessmen. Noticing the hand was pointed at them, Scrooge stepped closer to listen to their discussion. \"No,\" said a very large man with a huge chin, \"I don't know much about it either way. I only know he's passed away.\" \"When did he die?\" another asked. \"Last night, I believe.\" \"Why, what was wrong with him?\" inquired a third, taking a considerable amount of snuff from a very large box. \"I thought he'd live forever.\" \"Heaven knows,\" said the first man, yawning. \"What did he do with his fortune?\" asked a gentleman with a red face and a dangling growth on the end of his nose that shook like a turkey's wattle. \"I haven't heard,\" said the man with the large chin, yawning again. \"Probably left it to his business. He didn't leave it to *me*. That's all I can say.\" This joke was met with shared laughter. \"It's likely to be a very inexpensive funeral,\" the same speaker continued, \"because honestly, I don't know a soul who will attend. How about we form a group and volunteer?\" \"I don't mind going if they provide lunch,\" commented the gentleman with the nose growth. \"But I absolutely must be fed if I'm part of the group.\" More laughter followed. \"Well, I am the most unselfish among you, truly,\" said the first speaker, \"since I never wear black gloves and I never eat lunch. But I'll offer to go if anyone else will. Thinking about it, I'm not entirely sure I wasn't his closest friend; we used to stop and chat whenever we met. Goodbye!\" The speakers and listeners strolled away and mingled with other clusters. Scrooge recognized the men and looked towards the Spirit, expecting an explanation. The Phantom glided into a street. Its finger indicated two people meeting. Scrooge listened again, thinking the answer might be here. He recognized these men perfectly well too. They were wealthy and influential businessmen. He had always made sure he maintained a good standing in their estimation, purely from a business perspective. \"How are you?\" one said. \"How are you?\" the other replied. \"Well!\" said the first. \"Looks like the Devil finally claimed what's his, eh?\" \"So I'm told,\" replied the second. \"Cold, isn't it?\" \"Typical for Christmas. You're not a skater, I presume?\" \"No. No. Other things on my mind. Good morning!\" Not another word was exchanged. That was their meeting, their conversation, and their parting. Scrooge was initially inclined to be surprised that the Spirit seemed to find these seemingly trivial conversations important; but feeling certain they had a hidden purpose, he began to consider what it might be. They could hardly be related to the death of his old partner, Jacob, as that was in the past, and this Ghost's domain was the Future. Nor could he think of anyone directly connected to himself to whom these conversations would apply. But doubting nothing that, whomever they referred to, they contained a latent moral lesson for his own betterment, he resolved to carefully remember every word he heard and everything he saw, and especially to observe the shadow of his future self when it appeared. He anticipated that the behaviour of his future self would provide the missing clue and make the solution to these mysteries easy. He looked around in that very spot for his own image; but another man stood in his usual place, and although the clock showed the time he was typically present, he saw no likeness of himself among the crowds pouring in through the entrance. This did not surprise him much, however, as he had been contemplating a change in his life and thought, and hoped, that what he saw represented his new resolutions being put into effect. Quiet and dark, the Phantom stood beside him, with its hand extended. When he roused himself from his thoughtful search, he sensed from the position of the hand, and its relation to himself, that the Spirit's unseen eyes were intently watching him. This made him shiver and feel very cold.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "Scrooge and the Spirit seemed to be surrounded by the city as if it had sprung up around them, and found themselves on the Exchange at its busy center, where merchants bustled about, talked in groups, checked their watches, jingled coins, and fiddled with their grand gold seals—all scenes familiar to Scrooge. The Spirit paused by a small group of businessmen, and as its hand gestured toward them, Scrooge drew near to overhear their conversation. One stout man declared he only knew someone had died, with another asking when it happened and a third expressing surprise, having thought the man would never die. When asked what happened to the dead man’s money, the stout man speculated maybe it went to his company, laughed that it hadn’t come to him, and the group found this amusing. They joked about the funeral being cheaply attended and only considering going if lunch was included, adding to the laughter. The first man claimed to be the least interested since he neither wore black gloves nor ate lunch, but would go if someone else did and half-jokingly claimed to be the deceased’s closest friend, since they occasionally exchanged greetings. The group then wandered off to join others and Scrooge, knowing them all, looked to the Spirit for clarification. The Phantom moved on, indicating two other businessmen, both esteemed by Scrooge, who greeted each other briefly, made a remark about Old Scratch at last getting his due, commented about the weather, and parted. Scrooge wondered why such insignificant interactions mattered, but trusting the Spirit’s lesson, resolved to pay close attention, especially for any hint of himself in these shadows of the future. He looked for a sign of himself in his old spot, but someone else stood there, even though it was the usual time. This surprised him little, for he’d been thinking of changing his ways and hoped this absence meant he had. The Phantom stood quietly and coldly beside him, its hand extended, leaving Scrooge with an uneasy chill as he sensed its focus and pondered the meaning of these visions."

          "text_segment": "They left the busy scene, and went into an obscure part of the town, where Scrooge had never penetrated before, although he recognised its situation, and its bad repute. The ways were foul and narrow; the shops and houses wretched; the people half-naked, drunken, slipshod, ugly. Alleys and archways, like so many cesspools, disgorged their offences of smell, and dirt, and life, upon the straggling streets; and the whole quarter reeked with crime, with filth, and misery.\nFar in this den of infamous resort, there was a low-browed, beetling shop, below a pent-house roof, where iron, old rags, bottles, bones, and greasy offal, were bought. Upon the floor within, were piled up heaps of rusty keys, nails, chains, hinges, files, scales, weights, and refuse iron of all kinds. Secrets that few would like to scrutinise were bred and hidden in mountains of unseemly rags, masses of corrupted fat, and sepulchres of bones. Sitting in among the wares he dealt in, by a charcoal stove, made of old bricks, was a grey-haired rascal, nearly seventy years of age; who had screened himself from the cold air without, by a frousy curtaining of miscellaneous tatters, hung upon a line; and smoked his pipe in all the luxury of calm retirement.\nScrooge and the Phantom came into the presence of this man, just as a woman with a heavy bundle slunk into the shop. But she had scarcely entered, when another woman, similarly laden, came in too; and she was closely followed by a man in faded black, who was no less startled by the sight of them, than they had been upon the recognition of each other. After a short period of blank astonishment, in which the old man with the pipe had joined them, they all three burst into a laugh.\n“Let the charwoman alone to be the first!” cried she who had entered first. “Let the laundress alone to be the second; and let the undertaker’s man alone to be the third. Look here, old Joe, here’s a chance! If we haven’t all three met here without meaning it!”\n“You couldn’t have met in a better place,” said old Joe, removing his pipe from his mouth. “Come into the parlour. You were made free of it long ago, you know; and the other two an’t strangers. Stop till I shut the door of the shop. Ah! How it skreeks! There an’t such a rusty bit of metal in the place as its own hinges, I believe; and I’m sure there’s no such old bones here, as mine. Ha, ha! We’re all suitable to our calling, we’re well matched. Come into the parlour. Come into the parlour.”\nThe parlour was the space behind the screen of rags. The old man raked the fire together with an old stair-rod, and having trimmed his smoky lamp (for it was night), with the stem of his pipe, put it in his mouth again.\nWhile he did this, the woman who had already spoken threw her bundle on the floor, and sat down in a flaunting manner on a stool; crossing her elbows on her knees, and looking with a bold defiance at the other two.\n“What odds then! What odds, Mrs. Dilber?” said the woman. “Every person has a right to take care of themselves. He always did.”\n“That’s true, indeed!” said the laundress. “No man more so.”\n“Why then, don’t stand staring as if you was afraid, woman; who’s the wiser? We’re not going to pick holes in each other’s coats, I suppose?”\n“No, indeed!” said Mrs. Dilber and the man together. “We should hope not.”\n“Very well, then!” cried the woman. “That’s enough. Who’s the worse for the loss of a few things like these? Not a dead man, I suppose.”\n“No, indeed,” said Mrs. Dilber, laughing.\n“If he wanted to keep ’em after he was dead, a wicked old screw,” pursued the woman, “why wasn’t he natural in his lifetime? If he had been, he’d have had somebody to look after him when he was struck with Death, instead of lying gasping out his last there, alone by himself.”\n“It’s the truest word that ever was spoke,” said Mrs. Dilber. “It’s a judgment on him.”\n“I wish it was a little heavier judgment,” replied the woman; “and it should have been, you may depend upon it, if I could have laid my hands on anything else. Open that bundle, old Joe, and let me know the value of it. Speak out plain. I’m not afraid to be the first, nor afraid for them to see it. We know pretty well that we were helping ourselves, before we met here, I believe. It’s no sin. Open the bundle, Joe.”\nBut the gallantry of her friends would not allow of this; and the man in faded black, mounting the breach first, produced his plunder. It was not extensive. A seal or two, a pencil-case, a pair of sleeve-buttons, and a brooch of no great value, were all. They were severally examined and appraised by old Joe, who chalked the sums he was disposed to give for each, upon the wall, and added them up into a total when he found there was nothing more to come.\n“That’s your account,” said Joe, “and I wouldn’t give another sixpence, if I was to be boiled for not doing it. Who’s next?”\nMrs. Dilber was next. Sheets and towels, a little wearing apparel, two old-fashioned silver teaspoons, a pair of sugar-tongs, and a few boots. Her account was stated on the wall in the same manner.\n“I always give too much to ladies. It’s a weakness of mine, and that’s the way I ruin myself,” said old Joe. “That’s your account. If you asked me for another penny, and made it an open question, I’d repent of being so liberal and knock off half-a-crown.”\n“And now undo my bundle, Joe,” said the first woman.\nJoe went down on his knees for the greater convenience of opening it, and having unfastened a great many knots, dragged out a large and heavy roll of some dark stuff.\n“What do you call this?” said Joe. “Bed-curtains!”\n“Ah!” returned the woman, laughing and leaning forward on her crossed arms. “Bed-curtains!”\n“You don’t mean to say you took ’em down, rings and all, with him lying there?” said Joe.\n“Yes I do,” replied the woman. “Why not?”\n“You were born to make your fortune,” said Joe, “and you’ll certainly do it.”\n“I certainly shan’t hold my hand, when I can get anything in it by reaching it out, for the sake of such a man as He was, I promise you, Joe,” returned the woman coolly. “Don’t drop that oil upon the blankets, now.”\n“His blankets?” asked Joe.\n“Whose else’s do you think?” replied the woman. “He isn’t likely to take cold without ’em, I dare say.”\n“I hope he didn’t die of anything catching? Eh?” said old Joe, stopping in his work, and looking up.\n“Don’t you be afraid of that,” returned the woman. “I an’t so fond of his company that I’d loiter about him for such things, if he did. Ah! you may look through that shirt till your eyes ache; but you won’t find a hole in it, nor a threadbare place. It’s the best he had, and a fine one too. They’d have wasted it, if it hadn’t been for me.”\n“What do you call wasting of it?” asked old Joe.\n“Putting it on him to be buried in, to be sure,” replied the woman with a laugh. “Somebody was fool enough to do it, but I took it off again. If calico an’t good enough for such a purpose, it isn’t good enough for anything. It’s quite as becoming to the body. He can’t look uglier than he did in that one.”\nScrooge listened to this dialogue in horror. As they sat grouped about their spoil, in the scanty light afforded by the old man’s lamp, he viewed them with a detestation and disgust, which could hardly have been greater, though they had been obscene demons, marketing the corpse itself.\n“Ha, ha!” laughed the same woman, when old Joe, producing a flannel bag with money in it, told out their several gains upon the ground. “This is the end of it, you see! He frightened every one away from him when he was alive, to profit us when he was dead! Ha, ha, ha!”\n“Spirit!” said Scrooge, shuddering from head to foot. “I see, I see. The case of this unhappy man might be my own. My life tends that way, now. Merciful Heaven, what is this!”\n",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "They left the busy part of town and entered a hidden, unsavory district that Scrooge had never visited before, though he recognised its location and bad reputation. The streets were dirty and cramped, the shops and homes run-down, and the inhabitants poorly dressed, intoxicated, slovenly, and unattractive. Alleys and archways, like open drains, released their offensive smells, grime, and signs of impoverished life onto the irregular streets; the entire area reeked of crime, squalor, and hardship. Deep within this notorious haunt was a small, projecting shop beneath a sloped roof, where items like scrap metal, used clothes, bottles, bones, and animal fat were purchased. Inside, the floor was covered with piles of rusty keys, nails, chains, hinges, files, scales, weights, and various kinds of scrap metal. Secrets few would wish to examine were formed and hidden within mountains of unclean rags, lumps of spoiled fat, and bone heaps that resembled graves. Sitting among the goods he traded in, by a charcoal stove made of old bricks, was a seventy-year-old, grey-haired rogue, who had protected himself from the cold outside air with a messy curtain made of assorted rags hung on a line, calmly enjoying his pipe as if in peaceful retirement. Scrooge and the Ghost arrived in the presence of this man just as a woman carrying a heavy bundle quietly entered the shop. She had barely entered when another woman, similarly burdened, also arrived, followed closely by a man in worn black clothing. He was just as surprised to see them as they were to recognise each other. After a brief period of stunned silence, during which the old man with the pipe also paused, all three burst into laughter. “Leave it to the cleaning lady to be the first!” exclaimed the woman who had entered first. “Let the laundry woman be the second; and let the funeral assistant be the third. Look here, old Joe, what luck! We've all met here by chance!” “You couldn’t have met anywhere better,” said old Joe, taking his pipe from his mouth. “Come into the back room. You’ve always had access to it, you know; and the other two aren't strangers. Wait till I close the shop door. Ah! Listen to it squeak! I don't think there's anything rustier in this place than its own hinges, I truly believe; and I'm sure there are no bones here as old as mine. Ha, ha! We all fit our line of work, we're well matched. Come into the back room. Come into the back room.” The back room was the area behind the rag screen. The old man stirred the coals in the stove with an old stair rod and, having trimmed his smoky lamp wick (since it was night) with the stem of his pipe, put the pipe back in his mouth. While he did this, the woman who had already spoken dropped her bundle on the floor and sat boldly on a stool, resting her elbows on her knees and looking defiantly at the other two. “So what! What does it matter, Mrs. Dilber?” the woman asked. “Everyone has a right to look out for themselves. He certainly always did.” “That's absolutely true!” said the laundress. “No one did more so.” “Well then, don't stand there staring as if you're scared, woman; who gains by that? We're not going to find fault with each other, are we?” “Certainly not!” said Mrs. Dilber and the man together. “We sincerely hope not.” “Good, then!” cried the woman. “That’s enough. Who is worse off for losing a few items like these? Not a dead man, I assume.” “Certainly not,” said Mrs. Dilber, laughing. “If that cruel old miser wanted to keep them after he died,” the woman continued, “why wasn't he a decent person during his life? If he had been, someone would have been there to look after him when he was dying, instead of him lying there gasping his last breath, alone by himself.” “That's the truest thing ever said,” said Mrs. Dilber. “It's a punishment for him.” “I wish the punishment was a bit more severe,” replied the woman; “and it would have been, you can be sure, if I could have gotten my hands on anything else. Open that bundle, old Joe, and tell me its worth. Speak clearly. I'm not afraid to be the first, or afraid for them to see it. I think we all know we were helping ourselves before we met here. It's not a sin. Open the bundle, Joe.” But her friends' courtesy prevented this; the man in worn black stepped forward first and presented his stolen goods. It wasn't much: a few seals, a pencil case, a pair of cufflinks, and a brooch of little value were all. Old Joe examined and valued them individually, writing the price he was willing to pay for each on the wall and adding them up into a total once he confirmed there was nothing else. “That's your total,” said Joe, “and I wouldn't give another sixpence, even if I were boiled for refusing. Who’s next?” Mrs. Dilber was next. Sheets and towels, some clothing, two old-fashioned silver teaspoons, a pair of sugar tongs, and a few boots. Her total was marked on the wall in the same way. “I always give too much to ladies. It's a weakness of mine, and that's how I ruin myself,” said old Joe. “That's your total. If you asked me for another penny and made it a public issue, I’d regret being so generous and take off half a crown.” “And now, undo my bundle, Joe,” said the first woman. Joe knelt down to open it more easily, and after untying many knots, pulled out a large, heavy roll of dark fabric. “What do you call this?” said Joe. “Bed curtains!” “Haha!” returned the woman, laughing and leaning forward on her crossed arms. “Bed curtains!” “You don't mean to say you took them down, rings and all, with him lying there?” said Joe. “Yes, I do,” replied the woman. “Why not?” “You were meant to be rich,” said Joe, “and you’ll definitely succeed.” “I certainly won't hesitate to take whatever I can get my hands on, not for the sake of a man like him, I promise you, Joe,” the woman said calmly. “Just be careful not to drip that lamp oil on the blankets.” “His blankets?” asked Joe. “Whose else's do you think?” replied the woman. “He's not likely to get cold without them, I’d say.” “I hope he didn't die of something contagious? Huh?” said old Joe, pausing his work and looking up. “Don't you worry about that,” returned the woman. “I'm not fond enough of his company that I’d hang around him for such things, even if he did. Ha! You can examine that shirt until your eyes ache; but you won't find a hole in it, or a worn spot. It was the best he had, and a fine one too. They would have wasted it if I hadn't taken it.” “What do you call wasting it?” asked old Joe. “Putting it on him to be buried in, of course,” replied the woman with a laugh. “Someone was foolish enough to do that, but I removed it again. If simple cotton isn't suitable for that purpose, it's not suitable for anything. It looks perfectly fine on the body. He couldn’t look any uglier than he did in that one.” Scrooge listened to this conversation with horror. As they sat clustered around their loot in the dim light provided by the old man's lamp, he viewed them with a hatred and revulsion that could hardly have been stronger, even if they had been grotesque demons selling the body itself. “Haha!” laughed the same woman, when old Joe, taking out a flannel bag containing money, counted out their individual earnings on the ground. “This is the result, you see! He scared everyone away from him when he was alive, so that he could benefit us when he was dead! Hahaha!” “Spirit!” said Scrooge, trembling from head to foot. “I see, I see. The situation of this unhappy man could be my own. My life is heading that way now. Merciful Heaven, what is this!”",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "They moved away from the bustling city and entered a grim part of town Scrooge had never been to before, though he knew its reputation as a notorious area. The streets were dirty and cramped, with poor, run-down shops and homes, and the people there looked shabby, drunken, and unkempt. Narrow alleys and arches, reeking like open sewers, poured their foul odors, grime, and activity into the streets, and the whole district was full of crime, filth, and suffering.\n\nDeep in this unsavory place stood a low-built, overhanging shop under a makeshift roof, where items like scrap metal, rags, bottles, bones, and greasy waste were bought. Inside, the floor was piled with rusty keys, nails, chains, hinges, files, scales, weights, and all kinds of discarded metal. Filthy heaps of rags, decaying fat, and piles of bones concealed secrets few would wish to uncover. Among his wares, by a charcoal fire made from old bricks, sat a grey-haired scoundrel almost seventy years old, sheltered from the cold by hanging shreds of fabric, and smoking his pipe in comfort.\n\nScrooge and the ghost approached just as a woman with a heavy bundle entered the shop. She was quickly joined by another similarly burdened woman, and soon thereafter, a man dressed in worn black entered, just as surprised to see the others as they were to see him. After a brief shocked silence—joined by the old man— they all started laughing.\n\n“Let the housemaid take the lead!” said the first woman. “Let the laundress be the second; and let the undertaker’s man be the third. Look, Joe, what luck! We all showed up here together by chance!”\n\n“You couldn’t have picked a better place,” old Joe replied, removing his pipe. “Step into the parlor, you’re all familiar with it. Wait until I close the door. Listen to those creaking hinges; nothing else here is rustier, not even these old bones of mine! We’re quite a fitting group. Come inside.”\n\nThe so-called parlor was just the space behind a screen of rags. The old man poked at the fire with a stair-rod and trimmed his smoky lamp with his pipe stem before continuing to smoke.\n\nMeanwhile, the first woman tossed her bundle on the floor and sat down confidently, elbows on her knees, staring boldly at her companions.\n\n“So what! What’s the matter, Mrs. Dilber?” she said. “Everybody looks out for themselves. He always did.”\n\n“That’s true!” agreed the laundress. “No one more than him.”\n\n“Then don’t act scared—who’s going to notice? We aren’t about to criticize each other, are we?”\n\n“No way!” said Mrs. Dilber and the man.\n\n“All right! So, who’s hurt by losing a few items like these? Certainly not a dead man.”\n\n“Of course not,” Mrs. Dilber said, laughing.\n\n“If that mean old miser wanted to keep his stuff after he died, why wasn’t he kinder in life?” the woman added. “Then maybe someone would have cared for him when death came, instead of him dying alone.”\n\n“You’re right,” said Mrs. Dilber. “He earned this.”\n\n“I wish his fate was harsher,” replied the first woman, “and it would have been if I could have taken more. Open my bundle, Joe, and tell me what it’s worth. I don’t mind being first; we all know we’ve helped ourselves. No shame in it. Open it, Joe.”\n\nBut her friends insisted on going first, and the man in black presented his stolen items—a few trinkets like seals, a pencil case, cufflinks, and a brooch. Old Joe checked each item, chalked their value on the wall, and totaled them.\n\n“There’s your payout,” said Joe. “I wouldn’t pay a penny more.”\n\nMrs. Dilber went next, producing sheets, towels, some old clothes, a couple of silver teaspoons, sugar tongs, and some boots. Joe valued those in the same way.\n\n“I always give too much to the ladies, it’s my fault,” joked Joe. “If you asked for more, I’d reduce the price!”\n\n“Now open my bundle,” said the first woman.\n\nOn his knees, Joe undid her many knots and pulled out a heavy bundle of dark fabric.\n\n“What’s this?” Joe asked. “Bed curtains!”\n\n“Yes!” she replied, laughing.\n\n“You took them, rings and all, with him still in bed?” said Joe, surprised.\n\n“I sure did. Why not?”\n\n“You’ll make your fortune,” Joe commented.\n\n“I’m not going to miss any chance to profit from that man,” she replied casually. “Careful with that oil on the blankets.”\n\n“His blankets?” Joe asked.\n\n“Of course,” she said. “He won’t be needing them.”\n\n“He didn’t die of anything contagious, right?” Joe asked, pausing.\n\n“Don’t worry,” she answered. “I wouldn’t hang around if he did. Look at this—no holes, no wear. The best shirt he had. They were going to bury him in it, but I took it. Cheap cotton is good enough for burial; he can’t look any worse.”\n\nHorrified, Scrooge listened as they examined their loot by the meager lamplight. He regarded them with deep disgust, as if they were ghouls trading in the corpse itself.\n\n“This is how it ends!” laughed the woman, as Joe counted out their payment. “He scared everyone away in life, only to benefit us in death!”\n\n“Spirit!” cried Scrooge, trembling. “I understand! The fate of this miserable man could be mine. My life is headed that way. Merciful Heaven, what is this!”"

A pale light, rising in the outer air, fell straight upon the bed; and on it, plundered and bereft, unwatched, unwept, uncared for, was the body of this man.\nScrooge glanced towards the Phantom. Its steady hand was pointed to the head. The cover was so carelessly adjusted that the slightest raising of it, the motion of a finger upon Scrooge’s part, would have disclosed the face. He thought of it, felt how easy it would be to do, and longed to do it; but had no more power to withdraw the veil than to dismiss the spectre at his side.\nOh cold, cold, rigid, dreadful Death, set up thine altar here, and dress it with such terrors as thou hast at thy command: for this is thy dominion! But of the loved, revered, and honoured head, thou canst not turn one hair to thy dread purposes, or make one feature odious. It is not that the hand is heavy and will fall down when released; it is not that the heart and pulse are still; but that the hand was open, generous, and true; the heart brave, warm, and tender; and the pulse a man’s. Strike, Shadow, strike! And see his good deeds springing from the wound, to sow the world with life immortal!\nNo voice pronounced these words in Scrooge’s ears, and yet he heard them when he looked upon the bed. He thought, if this man could be raised up now, what would be his foremost thoughts? Avarice, hard-dealing, griping cares? They have brought him to a rich end, truly!\nHe lay, in the dark empty house, with not a man, a woman, or a child, to say that he was kind to me in this or that, and for the memory of one kind word I will be kind to him. A cat was tearing at the door, and there was a sound of gnawing rats beneath the hearth-stone. What they wanted in the room of death, and why they were so restless and disturbed, Scrooge did not dare to think.\n“Spirit!” he said, “this is a fearful place. In leaving it, I shall not leave its lesson, trust me. Let us go!”\nStill the Ghost pointed with an unmoved finger to the head.\n“I understand you,” Scrooge returned, “and I would do it, if I could. But I have not the power, Spirit. I have not the power.”\nAgain it seemed to look upon him.\n“If there is any person in the town, who feels emotion caused by this man’s death,” said Scrooge quite agonised, “show that person to me, Spirit, I beseech you!”",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "He stumbled back in fear as the scene shifted dramatically, bringing him close to a bed. It was a plain, bare bed without curtains. On it, beneath a torn sheet, lay something covered up, which, despite its silence, conveyed its awful meaning with chilling clarity. The room was intensely dark, too dim for accurate observation, though Scrooge instinctively looked around, compelled by a hidden urge to understand the space. A weak light from the outside air shone directly onto the bed, illuminating the body of the man who lay there, stripped of possessions, abandoned, unmourned, and neglected. Scrooge looked at the Phantom. Its unwavering hand pointed towards the head. The cover was placed so loosely that the slightest movement, even a touch from Scrooge's finger, would have revealed the face. He considered this, recognized how easily it could be done, and yearned to do it, but found himself unable to lift the veil, just as he could not make the spectre beside him disappear. The reflection arose: Oh, grim, cold, unyielding, terrifying Death, erect your altar here and deck it with the horrors at your command, for this is your dominion! But you cannot alter a single hair or make one feature hateful on a head that was loved, respected, and honored for your dreadful purposes. It's not just that the hand is heavy and falls limp, or that the heart and pulse are still; it's because that hand *was* open, generous, and true; the heart was brave, warm, and tender; and the pulse was that of a real man. Strike, Shadow, strike! And see his good deeds blossoming from the wound, to fill the world with eternal life! Although no voice spoke these words to Scrooge, he heard them in his mind as he looked at the bed. He wondered, if this man could be brought back to life now, what would be his primary thoughts? Greed, harsh dealings, anxious worries about possessions? These things, he thought, had certainly brought him to a 'rich' conclusion, in a grim sense! He lay there in the dark, empty house. Not a single person—man, woman, or child—was present to say, 'He was kind to me in this way or that, and for the memory of one kind word, I will be kind to him.' A cat was clawing at the door, and the sounds of rats gnawing came from under the hearth. Scrooge did not dare contemplate what they wanted in the room of death or why they were so restless and agitated. 'Spirit!' he cried, 'this is a terrifying place. Be assured, when we leave it, I will remember its lesson. Let us go!' The Ghost continued to point towards the head with an unmoving finger. 'I understand what you mean,' Scrooge replied, 'and I would do it if I could. But I don't have the power, Spirit. I lack the power.' The Spirit seemed to look at him again. 'If there is anyone in the city who feels any emotion about this man's death,' Scrooge said, now in agony, 'please, Spirit, show me that person, I beg you!'",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "He shrank back in fear as the setting altered, and suddenly he found himself next to a bed: plain, without curtains, nothing but a tattered sheet covering whatever lay beneath. The silent form beneath the sheet made its presence felt in a chilling, wordless way. The room was so dark that Scrooge couldn’t make out details, but he looked around, compelled to understand where he was. A faint light from outside fell upon the bed, illuminating the body of a man: alone, robbed, and neglected; no one watched over him, no one mourned, and no one cared. Scrooge glanced at the Phantom, whose unwavering hand pointed at the dead man’s head. The sheet was so loosely placed that it would only take the smallest action, even just a finger, to uncover the face. Scrooge wanted to lift the cover, knew how easily he could, but he was powerless to do so, just as he could not will the spirit beside him to leave. Cruel, merciless death, declare your reign here, heap it with every horror you possess—for this is your domain! Yet, over a cherished, respected head, you cannot defile a single hair or make a beloved face ugly. It's not the weight of the lifeless hand, nor the stillness of the heart and pulse, but the kindness, generosity, and courage that lived in them that matters. Strike, Shadow, strike! See how his goodness grows from his passing to bring everlasting life to the world! No one spoke these thoughts aloud, but Scrooge somehow heard them as he looked at the corpse. He wondered, if this man were brought back, what would occupy his mind—greed, selfishness, and harshness? Did these qualities lead him to this lonely end? He lay there in the dark, empty house, without a soul—man, woman, or child—to remember a kindness or wish him well for any good deed. A cat scratched at the door, and rats could be heard gnawing beneath the hearth. What drew them to the dead room or why they seemed so uneasy, Scrooge dared not imagine. \"Spirit!\" he cried, \"this is a dreadful place. When I leave, I promise I will not forget its lesson. Let us go!\" But the Ghost only kept pointing toward the man’s head. \"I understand,\" replied Scrooge, \"and I would do it if I could, but I am unable, Spirit. I cannot.\" The Phantom stayed silent but seemed to continue looking at him. \"If there is anyone in the town who feels anything about this man’s death,\" pleaded Scrooge in distress, \"show me that person, Spirit, I beg you!\""

She hurried to the door, and met her husband; a man whose face was careworn and depressed, though he was young. There was a remarkable expression in it now; a kind of serious delight of which he felt ashamed, and which he struggled to repress.\nHe sat down to the dinner that had been hoarding for him by the fire; and when she asked him faintly what news (which was not until after a long silence), he appeared embarrassed how to answer.\n“Is it good?” she said, “or bad?”—to help him.\n“Bad,” he answered.\n“We are quite ruined?”\n“No. There is hope yet, Caroline.”\n“If he relents,” she said, amazed, “there is! Nothing is past hope, if such a miracle has happened.”\n“He is past relenting,” said her husband. “He is dead.”\nShe was a mild and patient creature if her face spoke truth; but she was thankful in her soul to hear it, and she said so, with clasped hands. She prayed forgiveness the next moment, and was sorry; but the first was the emotion of her heart.\n“What the half-drunken woman whom I told you of last night, said to me, when I tried to see him and obtain a week’s delay; and what I thought was a mere excuse to avoid me; turns out to have been quite true. He was not only very ill, but dying, then.”\n“To whom will our debt be transferred?”\n“I don’t know. But before that time we shall be ready with the money; and even though we were not, it would be a bad fortune indeed to find so merciless a creditor in his successor. We may sleep to-night with light hearts, Caroline!”\nYes. Soften it as they would, their hearts were lighter. The children’s faces, hushed and clustered round to hear what they so little understood, were brighter; and it was a happier house for this man’s death! The only emotion that the Ghost could show him, caused by the event, was one of pleasure.",

She was clearly waiting for someone with intense anticipation, pacing back and forth, jumping at noises, looking out the window, checking the time, trying unsuccessfully to sew, and finding the children's playing difficult to bear. Finally, the long-awaited knock came. She rushed to the door and met her husband, a man who looked young but whose face showed the signs of hardship and worry. His expression was unusual now; it was a quiet happiness he seemed embarrassed by and tried to hide. He sat down to the dinner she had kept warm for him. When, after a long silence, she softly asked for news, he seemed hesitant to answer. To assist him, she asked, \"Is it good, or bad?\" He replied, \"Bad.\" She questioned, \"Are we utterly ruined?\" \"No,\" he said, \"there is still hope, Caroline.\" \"If *he* changes his mind,\" she exclaimed in surprise, \"there is hope! Nothing is beyond hope if such an unbelievable thing has happened.\" \"He is beyond changing his mind,\" her husband stated. \"He is dead.\" If her appearance was truthful, she was a gentle and patient woman, but inwardly she felt immense relief upon hearing this and admitted it with clasped hands. The next moment, she prayed for forgiveness and felt remorseful, but her initial reaction was the honest feeling of her heart. \"What the somewhat drunk woman I mentioned last night told me, when I tried to see him and get a week's delay, and what I thought was just an excuse to avoid me,\" he explained, \"turned out to be completely true. He was not just very ill, but dying at that very time.\" \"Who will our debt pass to?\" she inquired. \"I don't know,\" he replied. \"But we'll have the money ready before then. And even if we don't, it would be incredibly bad luck to find a creditor as heartless in his successor. We can sleep with light hearts tonight, Caroline!\" Indeed, no matter how they framed it, their hearts were lighter. The children, quieted and gathered around, their faces brighter as they listened to something they understood so little, seemed happier too. The house was a more cheerful place because of this man's death. The only feeling the Ghost could reveal, brought about by this event, was one of joy.",

She paced back and forth, jumped at every noise, looked out the window, checked the clock, tried to sew but couldn't concentrate, and was barely able to tolerate the noise of her children playing. Finally, after a long wait, there was a knock at the door. She rushed to open it and greeted her husband, a young man whose face showed signs of worry and sadness.

He sat down to eat dinner, which had been kept warm for him by the fire, and after a long, silent pause, when his wife quietly asked about the news, he seemed unsure how to respond. \"Is it good?\" she prompted, \"Or bad?\" \"Bad,\" he replied. \"Are we completely ruined?\" she asked. \"No,\" he said. \"There is still hope, Caroline.\" She was surprised. \"If he changes his mind, there is! Nothing is impossible if such a miracle has happened.\" \"He won’t change his mind,\" her husband said. \"He’s died.\" The woman was gentle and patient, or so her expression suggested, but she was inwardly thankful to hear this news and admitted it, pressing her hands together. She immediately prayed for forgiveness and felt remorseful, but her initial instinct was relief. \"What the half-drunk woman I mentioned last night told me—when I tried to speak with him and ask for a week’s grace—what I thought was just an excuse to avoid seeing me, turned out to be true. He was not only very ill, but dying then.\" \"To whom will we now owe the debt?\" she asked. \"I don’t know,\" he replied, \"but by the time it transfers, we’ll have the money. And even if we didn’t, it would be hard to imagine someone as harsh as him taking his place. Tonight at least, we can sleep easy!\" The couple did their best to soften the feelings, but their spirits were undeniably lifted. The children’s faces, gathered quietly around and not truly understanding, looked brighter, and the home was happier due to this man’s passing. The only feeling the Ghost could show from this event was one of happiness."

          "text_segment": "“Let me see some tenderness connected with a death,” said Scrooge; “or that dark chamber, Spirit, which we left just now, will be for ever present to me.”\nThe Ghost conducted him through several streets familiar to his feet; and as they went along, Scrooge looked here and there to find himself, but nowhere was he to be seen. They entered poor Bob Cratchit’s house; the dwelling he had visited before; and found the mother and the children seated round the fire.\nQuiet. Very quiet. The noisy little Cratchits were as still as statues in one corner, and sat looking up at Peter, who had a book before him. The mother and her daughters were engaged in sewing. But surely they were very quiet!\n“ ‘And He took a child, and set him in the midst of them.’ ”\nWhere had Scrooge heard those words? He had not dreamed them. The boy must have read them out, as he and the Spirit crossed the threshold. Why did he not go on?\nThe mother laid her work upon the table, and put her hand up to her face.\n“The colour hurts my eyes,” she said.\nThe colour? Ah, poor Tiny Tim!\n“They’re better now again,” said Cratchit’s wife. “It makes them weak by candle-light; and I wouldn’t show weak eyes to your father when he comes home, for the world. It must be near his time.”\n“Past it rather,” Peter answered, shutting up his book. “But I think he has walked a little slower than he used, these few last evenings, mother.”\nThey were very quiet again. At last she said, and in a steady, cheerful voice, that only faltered once:\n“I have known him walk with—I have known him walk with Tiny Tim upon his shoulder, very fast indeed.”\n“And so have I,” cried Peter. “Often.”\n“And so have I,” exclaimed another. So had all.\n“But he was very light to carry,” she resumed, intent upon her work, “and his father loved him so, that it was no trouble: no trouble. And there is your father at the door!”\nShe hurried out to meet him; and little Bob in his comforter—he had need of it, poor fellow—came in. His tea was ready for him on the hob, and they all tried who should help him to it most. Then the two young Cratchits got upon his knees and laid, each child a little cheek, against his face, as if they said, “Don’t mind it, father. Don’t be grieved!”\nBob was very cheerful with them, and spoke pleasantly to all the family. He looked at the work upon the table, and praised the industry and speed of Mrs. Cratchit and the girls. They would be done long before Sunday, he said.\n“Sunday! You went to-day, then, Robert?” said his wife.\n“Yes, my dear,” returned Bob. “I wish you could have gone. It would have done you good to see how green a place it is. But you’ll see it often. I promised him that I would walk there on a Sunday. My little, little child!” cried Bob. “My little child!”\nHe broke down all at once. He couldn’t help it. If he could have helped it, he and his child would have been farther apart perhaps than they were.\nHe left the room, and went up-stairs into the room above, which was lighted cheerfully, and hung with Christmas. There was a chair set close beside the child, and there were signs of some one having been there, lately. Poor Bob sat down in it, and when he had thought a little and composed himself, he kissed the little face. He was reconciled to what had happened, and went down again quite happy.\nThey drew about the fire, and talked; the girls and mother working still. Bob told them of the extraordinary kindness of Mr. Scrooge’s nephew, whom he had scarcely seen but once, and who, meeting him in the street that day, and seeing that he looked a little—“just a little down you know,” said Bob, inquired what had happened to distress him. “On which,” said Bob, “for he is the pleasantest-spoken gentleman you ever heard, I told him. ‘I am heartily sorry for it, Mr. Cratchit,’ he said, ‘and heartily sorry for your good wife.’ By the bye, how he ever knew that, I don’t know.”\n“Knew what, my dear?”\n“Why, that you were a good wife,” replied Bob.\n“Everybody knows that!” said Peter.\n“Very well observed, my boy!” cried Bob. “I hope they do. ‘Heartily sorry,’ he said, ‘for your good wife. If I can be of service to you in any way,’ he said, giving me his card, ‘that’s where I live. Pray come to me.’ Now, it wasn’t,” cried Bob, “for the sake of anything he might be able to do for us, so much as for his kind way, that this was quite delightful. It really seemed as if he had known our Tiny Tim, and felt with us.”\n“I’m sure he’s a good soul!” said Mrs. Cratchit.\n“You would be surer of it, my dear,” returned Bob, “if you saw and spoke to him. I shouldn’t be at all surprised—mark what I say!—if he got Peter a better situation.”\n“Only hear that, Peter,” said Mrs. Cratchit.\n“And then,” cried one of the girls, “Peter will be keeping company with some one, and setting up for himself.”\n“Get along with you!” retorted Peter, grinning.\n“It’s just as likely as not,” said Bob, “one of these days; though there’s plenty of time for that, my dear. But however and whenever we part from one another, I am sure we shall none of us forget poor Tiny Tim—shall we—or this first parting that there was among us?”\n“Never, father!” cried they all.\n“And I know,” said Bob, “I know, my dears, that when we recollect how patient and how mild he was; although he was a little, little child; we shall not quarrel easily among ourselves, and forget poor Tiny Tim in doing it.”\n“No, never, father!” they all cried again.\n“I am very happy,” said little Bob, “I am very happy!”\nMrs. Cratchit kissed him, his daughters kissed him, the two young Cratchits kissed him, and Peter and himself shook hands. Spirit of Tiny Tim, thy childish essence was from God!",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "Scrooge asked the Spirit to show him a scene of sympathy connected to a death, saying that otherwise, the image of the dark, empty room they had just seen would always stay with him. The Ghost led him through several streets Scrooge knew well. As they walked, Scrooge searched for himself among the passers-by, but he was nowhere to be found. They went into the humble home of Bob Cratchit, the same house Scrooge had visited before, and found the mother and children sitting around the fireplace. It was very quiet. The usually lively young Cratchits were completely still in a corner, watching Peter, who had a book in front of him. The mother and her daughters were sewing. Their silence was notably profound. '“And He took a child, and set him in the midst of them.”' Scrooge wondered where he had heard those words; he hadn't imagined them. The boy must have read them aloud just as he and the Spirit entered. Why did he stop? The mother put her sewing down and brought her hand to her face. She explained that the colour was bothering her eyes. Scrooge understood instantly, thinking of poor Tiny Tim. She added that her eyes were better now but were sensitive in the dim candlelight, and she didn't want her husband to see them looking weak when he returned, which should be soon. Peter responded, closing his book, 'Past it, actually. But I think he's been walking a bit slower than usual these last few evenings, Mother.' The quiet returned. Finally, she spoke in a steady, cheerful voice that only trembled once: 'I remember him walking—I remember him walking with Tiny Tim on his shoulder, quite quickly, actually.' 'Me too,' Peter exclaimed. 'Often.' 'And me,' another added. They all had. 'But he was very light to carry,' she continued, focused on her sewing, 'and his father loved him so much it wasn't a burden at all. And there's your father at the door!' She hurried out to meet him. Little Bob entered, wrapped in his comforter, which he needed. His tea was warm by the fire, and everyone competed to serve him. Then the two youngest children climbed onto his lap and pressed their cheeks against his face, as if silently urging him, 'Don't worry, Father. Don't be sad!' Bob was outwardly cheerful with them, speaking kindly to everyone. He noticed the sewing and praised Mrs. Cratchit and the girls' speed and skill, saying they'd be finished well before Sunday. 'Sunday! You went today, then, Robert?' his wife asked. 'Yes, my dear,' Bob replied. 'I wish you could have come. You would have liked how green the place is. But you'll see it often. I promised him I would walk there every Sunday. My little, little child!' Bob suddenly broke down, sobbing, 'My little child!' He couldn't control it. If he could have, perhaps he and his son might have felt less close. He left the room and went upstairs to a room that was brightly lit and decorated for Christmas. There was a chair pulled close to where the child lay, showing someone had been there recently. Poor Bob sat down, collected himself, and then gently kissed the child's face. He accepted his loss and came back downstairs feeling peaceful. They gathered around the fire, talking, the women still working. Bob told them about the remarkable kindness of Mr. Scrooge's nephew, whom he'd barely met before. Fred had seen him in the street that day, noticed he looked a little 'just a little down, you know,' Bob said, and asked what was troubling him. 'Because he's the most pleasant-spoken gentleman you could meet,' Bob explained, 'I told him. \"I'm deeply sorry for it, Mr. Cratchit,\" he said, \"and deeply sorry for your good wife.\" By the way, how he knew that, I have no idea.' 'Knew what, dear?' 'Why, that you were a good wife,' Bob answered. 'Everyone knows that!' Peter declared. 'Well said, my boy!' Bob exclaimed. 'I hope so. \"Deeply sorry,\" he said, \"for your good wife. If I can help you in any way,\" he added, giving me his card, \"that's where I live. Please come to me.\" And it wasn't,' Bob insisted, 'because of anything he might do for us, but because of his kind manner, that this felt so wonderful. It truly seemed as though he had known our Tiny Tim and shared our feelings.' 'I'm sure he's a good soul!' said Mrs. Cratchit. 'You'd be even surer, my dear,' Bob replied, 'if you met and spoke to him. I wouldn't be surprised at all—mark my words!—if he found Peter a better job.' 'Just listen to that, Peter,' said Mrs. Cratchit. 'And then,' cried one of the girls, 'Peter will start dating someone and setting up his own place!' 'Oh, stop it!' Peter retorted, grinning. 'It's quite likely,' Bob said, 'one of these days, although there's plenty of time for that, my dear. But no matter how or when we are separated, I am certain none of us will ever forget poor Tiny Tim—will we—or this first separation we've experienced?' 'Never, Father!' they all cried. 'And I know,' said Bob, 'I know, my dears, that when we remember how patient and gentle he was, even though he was a very small child, we won't argue easily among ourselves and forget poor Tiny Tim in the process.' 'No, never, Father!' they cried again. 'I am very happy,' little Bob said. 'I am very happy!' Mrs. Cratchit kissed him, his daughters kissed him, the two youngest children kissed him, and Peter shook his hand. Spirit of Tiny Tim, your pure, child-like essence came from God!",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "“Show me some compassion linked to death,” Scrooge pleaded, “or that somber room we just left, Spirit, will haunt me forever.”\n\nThe Ghost guided him along streets he recognized, and Scrooge searched for a glimpse of himself but did not find it. They entered the humble home of Bob Cratchit, the one Scrooge had visited before, and found Mrs. Cratchit and her children gathered quietly around the fire. The once-noisy Cratchit children sat motionless, their eyes fixed on Peter, who held a book. The mother and her daughters were sewing, the silence uncharacteristic for them.\n\n“‘And He took a child, and placed him among them.’”\n\nScrooge wondered where he had heard those words before. They weren’t a figment of his imagination; the boy must have read them aloud as he and the Spirit walked in. But he didn’t continue reading.\n\nMrs. Cratchit set her sewing down and covered her face with her hand. “The color hurts my eyes,” she explained. The color? Poor Tiny Tim.\n\n“My eyes are better now,” she continued. “The candlelight makes them weak sometimes; but I wouldn’t let your father see my eyes looking weak, not for the world. He should be home soon.”\n\n“He’s a bit late, actually,” Peter replied, closing his book. “I think he’s been walking more slowly these past evenings, Mother.”\n\nThey became silent once more. Finally, Mrs. Cratchit said, her voice steady though it wavered briefly: “I remember your father walking very quickly with Tiny Tim on his shoulders.”\n\n“So do I,” said Peter.\n\n“And so do I,” another child echoed. They all agreed.\n\n“He was so light to carry,” Mrs. Cratchit added, returning to her work. “And his father loved him so much, it was never any trouble. And look, your father is at the door!”\n\nShe hurried to greet him, and Bob came in wearing his scarf—he certainly needed the comfort now. Tea was waiting, and everyone quickly tried to help him. The younger Cratchits climbed onto his lap, pressing their cheeks to his face in silent comfort: “Don’t be sad, father.”\n\nBob did his best to stay cheerful and spoke kindly to everyone. He looked at the sewing and praised the speed and hard work of Mrs. Cratchit and the girls, saying the job would be finished well before Sunday.\n\n“Sunday! You went today, Robert?” Mrs. Cratchit asked.\n\n“Yes, my dear,” Bob answered. “I wish you could have come. It would have made you feel better to see how green the grave is. But soon, you’ll visit often. I promised him that I’d go every Sunday. My little, little child!” Bob broke down, overcome with emotion. He could not control himself. Had he been able to, perhaps he and his lost child would be further apart.\n\nHe left the room and went upstairs to a small, brightly decorated room. A chair sat close beside the little bed, showing signs of recent use. Bob sat in the chair, composed himself for a bit, kissed Tiny Tim’s face, and found peace with what had happened. He returned to the family, feeling comforted.\n\nGathered around the fire, they talked as the girls and Mrs. Cratchit kept working. Bob shared the exceptional kindness of Mr. Scrooge’s nephew, whom he had met only once before, but who, seeing Bob looking a bit down, had asked what was wrong. “He’s the pleasantest man you could meet,” Bob said. “When I told him, he said, ‘I’m truly sorry for your loss, Mr. Cratchit, and for your good wife.’ How he knew you were a good wife, I don’t know.”\n\n“How did he know that, dear?” Mrs. Cratchit asked.\n\n“Everyone knows that!” Peter piped up.\n\n“Good answer, my boy!” Bob exclaimed. “‘I’m truly sorry for your good wife. If I can help you in any way, here’s my address. Come see me.’ It wasn’t so much what he might do for us, but the kindness in his manner that was comforting. It seemed as though he had really known Tiny Tim and shared our grief.”\n\n“He must be a good man!” Mrs. Cratchit said.\n\n“You’d be even more convinced if you met him,” Bob replied. “I wouldn’t be surprised—remember my words!—if Peter gets a better job because of him.”\n\n“Did you hear that, Peter?” Mrs. Cratchit said.\n\n“And then,” one of the girls added, “Peter will have a sweetheart and his own home.”\n\n“Stop it!” Peter laughed.\n\n“It could happen,” Bob said. “There’s plenty of time for that. But however and whenever we move on, I’m sure we’ll never forget Tiny Tim or this first parting among us.”\n\n“Never, Father!” they all declared.\n\n“I know, my dears, that remembering how gentle and patient he was, even as a little child, will help us stay united and refrain from quarrelling,” Bob said.\n\n“No, we never will, Father!” they all responded.\n\n“I am very happy,” Bob said, “very happy!”\n\nMrs. Cratchit and their children kissed him and Peter shook his hand.

Tell me what man that was whom we saw lying dead?”\nThe Ghost of Christmas Yet To Come conveyed him, as before—though at a different time, he thought: indeed, there seemed no order in these latter visions, save that they were in the Future—into the resorts of business men, but showed him not himself. Indeed, the Spirit did not stay for anything, but went straight on, as to the end just now desired, until besought by Scrooge to tarry for a moment.\n“This court,” said Scrooge, “through which we hurry now, is where my place of occupation is, and has been for a length of time. I see the house. Let me behold what I shall be, in days to come!”\nThe Spirit stopped; the hand was pointed elsewhere.\n“The house is yonder,” Scrooge exclaimed. “Why do you point away?”\nThe inexorable finger underwent no change.\nScrooge hastened to the window of his office, and looked in. It was an office still, but not his. The furniture was not the same, and the figure in the chair was not himself. The Phantom pointed as before.\nHe joined it once again, and wondering why and whither he had gone, accompanied it until they reached an iron gate. He paused to look round before entering.\nA churchyard. Here, then; the wretched man whose name he had now to learn, lay underneath the ground. It was a worthy place. Walled in by houses; overrun by grass and weeds, the growth of vegetation’s death, not life; choked up with too much burying; fat with repleted appetite. A worthy place!\nThe Spirit stood among the graves, and pointed down to One. He advanced towards it trembling. The Phantom was exactly as it had been, but he dreaded that he saw new meaning in its solemn shape.\n“Before I draw nearer to that stone to which you point,” said Scrooge, “answer me one question. Are these the shadows of the things that Will be, or are they shadows of things that May be, only?”\nStill the Ghost pointed downward to the grave by which it stood.\n“Men’s courses will foreshadow certain ends, to which, if persevered in, they must lead,” said Scrooge. “But if the courses be departed from, the ends will change. Say it is thus with what you show me!”\nThe Spirit was immovable as ever.\nScrooge crept towards it, trembling as he went; and following the finger, read upon the stone of the neglected grave his own name, Ebenezer Scrooge.\n“Am I that man who lay upon the bed?” he cried, upon his knees.",

Please tell me, who was that man we saw lying dead?” The Ghost of Christmas Yet To Come transported him as before, though Scrooge felt they were at a different point in time. Indeed, these later visions seemed without pattern, except that they clearly belonged to the Future. They arrived in the places where business was conducted, but the Ghost did not show him himself. In fact, the Spirit didn't pause for anything, moving purposefully forward as if directly towards the intended destination, until Scrooge begged it to wait for a moment. “This street,” said Scrooge, “which we are hurrying through now, is where my business has been located for a long time. I recognize the building. Let me see what I will become in the future!” The Spirit stopped, but its hand directed him elsewhere. “My office is there,” Scrooge cried out, indicating the building. “Why are you pointing away?” The relentless finger did not alter its position. Scrooge rushed to the window of his office and peered inside. It was still an office, but not his. The furnishings were different, and the person sitting in the chair was not him. The Phantom continued to point in the original direction. He rejoined the Spirit, wondering why they had gone and where they were headed, and walked alongside it until they came to an iron gate. He paused to look around before stepping through. It was a graveyard. This was it, then; the miserable man whose identity he needed to learn lay beneath the earth here. It was a fitting place. Surrounded by buildings, overgrown with grass and weeds – signs of decay, not life – overcrowded with burials, bulging as if from overconsumption. A fitting place indeed! The Spirit stood among the tombstones and pointed down to one specific grave. Scrooge walked towards it, shaking. The Phantom looked just as it had, but he feared he now understood a new, terrible significance in its silent form. “Before I approach that headstone you are indicating,” Scrooge said, “answer me one question. Are these glimpses of events that are certain to happen, or merely things that could possibly happen?” The Ghost remained silent, still pointing down at the grave beside it. “People's actions will lead to predictable outcomes, which they will certainly reach if they continue on that path,” Scrooge reflected. “But if they change course, the outcomes will change. Tell me that this is true for what you are showing me!” The Spirit was as still and unmoving as ever. Trembling with each step, Scrooge crept closer, following the finger's direction, and read his own name, Ebenezer Scrooge, on the stone of the neglected grave. “Am I the man who was lying on the bed?” he cried, falling to his knees.",

However, Scrooge did not see himself among them. The Spirit moved onward purposefully, not pausing until Scrooge pled for a moment’s delay. \n\n\"This courtyard we're rushing through is where I work and have worked for many years. I can see my office. Show me what will become of me in the future!\" begged Scrooge. But the Spirit pointed elsewhere. \n\n\"That’s my office right there,\" Scrooge said. \"Why are you pointing away?\" \n\nThe Spirit’s unmoving finger did not change direction. Scrooge hurried to the office window and looked inside. It was still an office, but no longer his: different furnishings, and someone else sat in the chair. The Phantom kept pointing.\n\nScrooge rejoined the Spirit, wondering where he was being taken, until they came to an iron gate. Before going through, Scrooge paused to look around.\n\nThey stood in a churchyard—the resting place of the unhappy man whose identity he needed to uncover. It was a fitting spot: surrounded by buildings, overgrown with weeds and grass that flourished because of decay—not life; crowded and overfull, as if its appetite for the dead had been sated. A suitable place indeed.\n\nThe Spirit stood among the graves, gesturing to one. Scrooge, shivering, moved toward it. The Phantom hadn’t changed in appearance, but Scrooge sensed its meaning was more grave than before.\n\n\"Before I get closer to the stone you’re showing me, answer me this: are these images of what will definitely happen, or just things that might occur?\" Scrooge asked. The Ghost continued to indicate the grave.\n\n\"People’s actions hint at specific outcomes. If they stick to those actions, that’s where they’ll end up. But if they choose another path, their fate changes. Is this what you’re showing me?\" implored Scrooge.\n\nThe Spirit remained as still as ever. Scrooge, trembling, edged toward the grave. Following the Spirit’s finger, he read the name on the neglected stone: Ebenezer Scrooge.\n\n\"Am I the man who lay dead on that bed?\" he cried out, falling to his knees."

He became as good a friend, as good a master, and as good a man, as the good old city knew, or any other good old city, town, or borough, in the good old world. Some people laughed to see the alteration in him, but he let them laugh, and little heeded them; for he was wise enough to know that nothing ever happened on this globe, for good, at which some people did not have their fill of laughter in the outset; and knowing that such as these would be blind anyway, he thought it quite as well that they should wrinkle up their eyes in grins, as have the malady in less attractive forms. His own heart laughed: and that was quite enough for him.\nHe had no further intercourse with Spirits, but lived upon the Total Abstinence Principle, ever afterwards; and it was always said of him, that he knew how to keep Christmas well, if any man alive possessed the knowledge. May that be truly said of us, and all of us! And so, as Tiny Tim observed, God bless Us, Every One!",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "Scrooge surpassed his promises, doing everything he said he would and far more. He became like a second father to Tiny Tim, who survived his illness. He transformed into the best friend, employer, and man the old city, or indeed any place, had ever known. Some people found his change humorous, but he paid them little attention, understanding that any significant good deed or transformation in the world initially draws laughter from some. He knew such people would always find fault and considered it better that they crease their eyes in grins than express their negativity in less pleasant ways. His own happiness was enough for him. He had no more encounters with spirits, living thereafter by a principle of complete change from his past ways. It was consistently said that he understood how to celebrate Christmas properly, better than anyone alive. The text ends with a wish that this might be true for all of us, and concludes with Tiny Tim's famous blessing, 'God bless Us, Every One!'",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "Scrooge exceeded the promises he made and did even more than expected; he became like a second father to Tiny Tim, who survived. Scrooge turned into the kindest friend, the best employer, and one of the finest men the city—or any city—ever knew. Some people laughed at how much he had changed, but he didn’t mind, knowing that whenever anything genuinely good is done, some people will mock at first. He realized people like that would always exist, so he thought it was better for them to smile at his transformation than show their scorn in other ways. Scrooge himself was joyful, and that was all he needed. From then on, he had no more encounters with Spirits and lived a life of moderation. He became famous for celebrating Christmas in the truest way, and people would say that no one kept Christmas better than he did. Let’s hope the same can be said of us! And, as Tiny Tim said, 'God bless us, every one!'"
