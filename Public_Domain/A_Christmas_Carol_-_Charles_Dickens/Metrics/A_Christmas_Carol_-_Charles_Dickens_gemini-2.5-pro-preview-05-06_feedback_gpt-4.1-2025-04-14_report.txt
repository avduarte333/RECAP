asked scrooge if he knew it “ know it ” said scrooge “ was i apprenticed here ” they went in at sight of an old gentleman in a welsh wig sitting behind such a high desk that if he had been two inches taller he must have knocked his head against the ceiling scrooge cried in great excitement “ why it ’ s old fezziwig bless his heart it ’ s fezziwig alive again ” old fezziwig laid down his pen and looked up at the clock which pointed to the hour of seven he rubbed his hands adjusted his capacious waistcoat laughed all over himself from his shoes to his organ of benevolence and called out in a comfortable oily rich fat jovial voice “ yo ho there ebenezer dick ” scrooge ’ s former self now grown a young man came briskly in accompanied by his fellow ’ prentice “ dick wilkins to be sure ” said scrooge to the ghost “ bless me yes there he is he was very much attached to me was dick poor dick dear dear ” “ yo ho my boys ” said fezziwig “ no more work tonight christmas eve dick christmas ebenezer let ’ s have the shutters up ” cried old fezziwig with a sharp clap of his hands “ before a man can say jack robinson ” you wouldn ’ t believe how those two fellows went at it they charged into the street with the shuttersone two threehad ’ em up in their placesfour five sixbarred ’ em and pinned ’ emseven eight nineand came back before you could have got to twelve panting like racehorses “ hilliho ” cried old fezziwig skipping down from the high desk with wonderful agility “ clear away my lads and let ’ s have lots of room here hilliho dick chirrup ebenezer ” clear away there was nothing they wouldn ’ t have cleared away or couldn ’ t have cleared away with old fezziwig looking on it was done in a minute every movable was packed off as if it were dismissed from public life for evermore the floor was swept and watered the lamps were trimmed fuel was heaped upon the fire and the warehouse was as snug and warm and dry and bright a ballroom as you would desire to see upon a winter ’ s night in came a fiddler with a musicbook and went up to the lofty desk and made an orchestra of it and tuned like fifty stomachaches in came mrs fezziwig one vast substantial smile in came the three miss fezziwigs beaming and lovable in came the six young followers whose hearts they broke in came all the young men and women employed in the business in came the housemaid with her cousin the baker in came the cook with her brother ’ s particular friend the milkman in came the boy from over the way who was suspected of not having board enough from his master trying to hide himself behind the girl from next door but one who was proved to have had her ears pulled by her mistress in they all came one after another some shyly some boldly some gracefully some awkwardly some pushing some pulling in they all came anyhow and everyhow away they all went twenty couple at once hands half round and back again the other way down the middle and up again round and round in various stages of affectionate grouping old top couple always turning up in the wrong place new top couple starting off again as soon as they got there all top couples at last and not a bottom one to help them when this result was brought about old fezziwig clapping his hands to stop the dance cried out “ well done ” and the fiddler plunged his hot face into a pot of porter especially provided for that purpose but scorning rest upon his reappearance he instantly began again though there were no dancers yet as if the other fiddler had been carried home exhausted on a shutter and he were a brannew man resolved to beat him out of sight or perish there were more dances and there were forfeits and more dances and there was cake and there was negus and there was a great piece of cold roast and there was a great piece of cold boiled and there were mincepies and plenty of beer but the great effect of the evening came after the roast and boiled when the fiddler ( an artful dog mind the sort of man who knew his business better than you or i could have told it him ) struck up “ sir roger de coverley ” then old fezziwig stood out to dance with mrs fezziwig top couple too with a good stiff piece of work cut out for them three or four and twenty pair of partners people who were not to be trifled with people who would dance and had no notion of walking but if they had been twice as manyah four timesold fezziwig would have been a match for them and so would mrs fezziwig as to her she was worthy to be his partner in every sense of the term if that ’ s not high praise tell me higher and i ’ ll use it a positive light appeared to issue from fezziwig ’ s calves they shone in every part of the dance like moons you couldn ’ t have predicted at any given time what would have become of them next and when old fezziwig and mrs fezziwig had gone all through the dance advance and retire both hands to your partner bow and curtsey corkscrew threadtheneedle and back again to your place fezziwig “ cut ” cut so deftly that he appeared to wink with his legs and came upon his feet again without a stagger when the clock struck eleven this domestic ball broke up mr and mrs fezziwig took their stations one on either side of the door and shaking hands with every person individually as he or she went out wished him or her a merry christmas when everybody had retired but the two ’ prentices they did the same to them and thus the cheerful voices died away and the lads were left to their beds which were under a counter in the backshop during the whole of this time scrooge had acted like a man out of his wits his heart and soul were in the scene and with his former self he corroborated everything remembered everything enjoyed everything and underwent the strangest agitation it was not until now when the bright faces of his former self and dick were turned from them that he remembered the ghost and became conscious that it was looking full upon him while the light upon its head burnt very clear “ a small matter ” said the ghost “ to make these silly folks so full of gratitude ” “ small"
