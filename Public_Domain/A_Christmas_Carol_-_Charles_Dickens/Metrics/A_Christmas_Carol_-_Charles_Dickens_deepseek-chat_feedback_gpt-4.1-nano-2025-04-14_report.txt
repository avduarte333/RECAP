   "here the flickering of the blaze showed preparations for a cosy dinner with hot plates baking through and through before the fire and deep red curtains ready to be drawn to shut out cold and darkness there all the children of the house were running out into the snow to meet their married sisters brothers cousins uncles aunts and be the first to greet them here again were shadows on the windowblind of guests assembling and there a group of handsome girls all hooded and furbooted and all chattering at once tripped lightly off to some near neighbour ’ s house where woe upon the single man who saw them enterartful witches well they knew itin a glow but if you had judged from the numbers of people on their way to friendly gatherings you might have thought that no one was at home to give them welcome when they got there instead of every house expecting company and piling up its fires halfchimney high blessings on it how the ghost exulted how it bared its breadth of breast and opened its capacious palm and floated on outpouring with a generous hand its bright and harmless mirth on everything within its reach the very lamplighter who ran on before dotting the dusky street with specks of light and who was dressed to spend the evening somewhere laughed out loudly as the spirit passed though little kenned the lamplighter that he had any company but christmas and now without a word of warning from the ghost they stood upon a bleak and desert moor where monstrous masses of rude stone were cast about as though it were the burialplace of giants and water spread itself wheresoever it listed or would have done so but for the frost that held it prisoner and nothing grew but moss and furze and coarse rank grass down in the west the setting sun had left a streak of fiery red which glared upon the desolation for an instant like a sullen eye and frowning lower lower lower yet was lost in the thick gloom of darkest night “ what place is this ” asked scrooge “ a place where miners live who labour in the bowels of the earth ” returned the spirit “ but they know me see ” a light shone from the window of a hut and swiftly they advanced towards it passing through the wall of mud and stone they found a cheerful company assembled round a glowing fire an old old man and woman with their children and their children ’ s children and another generation beyond that all decked out gaily in their holiday attire the old man in a voice that seldom rose above the howling of the wind upon the barren waste was singing them a christmas songit had been a very old song when he was a boyand from time to time they all joined in the chorus so surely as they raised their voices the old man got quite blithe and loud and so surely as they stopped his vigour sank again the spirit did not tarry here but bade scrooge hold his robe and passing on above the moor spedwhither not to sea to sea to scrooge ’ s horror looking back he saw the last of the land a frightful range of rocks behind them and his ears were deafened by the thundering of water as it rolled and roared and raged among the dreadful caverns it had worn and fiercely tried to undermine the earth built upon a dismal reef of sunken rocks some league or so from shore on which the waters chafed and dashed the wild year through there stood a solitary lighthouse great heaps of seaweed clung to its base and stormbirdsborn of the wind one might suppose as seaweed of the waterrose and fell about it like the waves they skimmed but even here two men who watched the light had made a fire that through the loophole in the thick stone wall shed out a ray of brightness on the awful sea joining their horny hands over the rough table at which they sat they wished each other merry christmas in their can of grog and one of them the elder too with his face all damaged and scarred with hard weather as the figurehead of an old ship might be struck up a sturdy song that was like a gale in itself again the ghost sped on above the black and heaving seaon onuntil being far away as he told scrooge from any shore they lighted on a ship they stood beside the helmsman at the wheel the lookout in the bow the officers who had the watch dark ghostly figures in their several stations but every man among them hummed a christmas tune or had a christmas thought or spoke below his breath to his companion of some bygone christmas day with homeward hopes belonging to it and every man on board waking or sleeping good or bad had had a kinder word for another on that day than on any day in the year and had shared to some extent in its festivities and had remembered those he cared for at a distance and had known that they delighted to remember him it was a great surprise to scrooge while listening to the moaning of the wind and thinking what a solemn thing it was to move on through the lonely darkness over an unknown abyss whose depths were secrets as profound as death it was a great surprise to scrooge while thus engaged to hear a hearty laugh it was a much greater surprise to scrooge to recognise it as his own nephew ’ s and to find himself in a bright dry gleaming room with the spirit standing smiling by his side and looking at that same nephew with approving affability “ ha ha ” laughed scrooge ’ s nephew “ ha ha ha ” if you should happen by any unlikely chance to know a man more blest in a laugh than scrooge ’ s nephew all i can say is i should like to know him too introduce him to me and i ’ ll cultivate his acquaintance it is a fair evenhanded noble adjustment of things that while there is infection in disease and sorrow there is nothing in the world so irresistibly contagious as laughter and goodhumour when scrooge ’ s nephew laughed in this way holding his sides rolling his head and twisting his face into the most extravagant contortions scrooge ’ s niece by marriage laughed as heartily as he and their assembled friends being not a bit behindhand roared out lustily “ ha ha ha ha ha ha ” “ he said that christmas was a humbug as i live ” cried scrooge ’ s nephew “ he believed it too ” “ more shame for him fred ” said scrooge ’ s niece indignantly bless those women they never do anything by halves they are always in earnest she was very pretty exceedingly pretty with a dimpled surprisedlooking capital face a ripe little mouth that seemed made to be kissedas no doubt it was all kinds of good little dots about her chin that melted into one another when she laughed and the sunniest pair of eyes you ever saw in any little creature ’ s head altogether she was what you would have called provoking you know but satisfactory too oh perfectly satisfactory “ he ’ s a comical old fellow ” said scrooge ’ s nephew “ that ’ s the truth and not so pleasant as he might be however his offences carry their own punishment and i have nothing to say against him ” “ i ’ m sure he is very rich fred ” hinted scrooge ’ s niece “ at least you always tell me so ” “ what of that my dear ” said scrooge ’ s nephew “ his wealth is of no use to him he don ’ t do any good with it he don ’ t make himself comfortable with it he hasn ’ t the satisfaction of thinkingha ha hathat he is ever going to benefit us with it ” “ i have no patience with him ” observed scrooge ’ s niece scrooge ’ s niece ’ s sisters and all the other ladies expressed the same opinion “ oh i have ” said scrooge ’ s nephew “ i am sorry for him i couldn ’ t be angry with him if i tried who suffers by his ill whims himself always here he takes it into his head to dislike us and he won ’ t come and dine with us what ’ s the consequence he don ’ t lose much of a dinner ” “ indeed i think he loses a very good dinner ” interrupted scrooge ’ s niece everybody else said the same and they must be allowed to have been competent judges because they had just had dinner and with the dessert upon the table were clustered round the fire by lamplight “ well i ’ m very glad to hear it ” said scrooge ’ s nephew “ because i haven ’ t great faith in these young housekeepers what do you say topper ” topper had clearly got his eye upon one of scrooge ’ s niece ’ s sisters for he answered that a bachelor was a wretched outcast who had no right to express an opinion on the subject whereat scrooge ’ s niece ’ s sisterthe plump one with the lace tucker not the one with the rosesblushed “ do go on fred ” said scrooge ’ s niece clapping her hands “ he never finishes what he begins to say he is such a ridiculous fellow ” scrooge ’ s nephew revelled in another laugh and as it was impossible to keep the infection off though the plump sister tried hard to do it with aromatic vinegar his example was unanimously followed “ i was only going to say ” said scrooge ’ s nephew “ that the consequence of his taking a dislike to us and not making merry with us is as i think that he loses some pleasant moments which could do him no harm i am sure he loses pleasanter companions than he can find in his own thoughts either in his mouldy old office or his dusty chambers i mean to give him the same chance every year whether he likes it or not for i pity him he may rail at christmas till he dies but he can ’ t help thinking better of iti defy himif he finds me going there in good temper year after year and saying uncle scrooge how are you if it only puts him in the vein to leave his poor clerk fifty pounds that ’ s something and i think i shook him yesterday ” it was their turn to laugh now at the notion of his shaking scrooge but being thoroughly goodnatured and not much caring what they laughed at so that they laughed at any rate he encouraged them in their merriment and passed the bottle joyously after tea they had some music for they were a musical family and knew what they were about when they sung a glee or catch i can assure you especially topper who could growl away in the bass like a good one and never swell the large veins in his forehead or get red in the face over it scrooge ’ s niece played well upon the harp and played among other tunes a simple little air ( a mere nothing you might learn to whistle it in two minutes ) which had been familiar to the child who fetched scrooge from the boardingschool as he had been reminded by the ghost of christmas past when this strain of music sounded all the things that ghost had shown him came upon his mind he softened more and more and thought that if he could have listened to it often years ago he might have cultivated the kindnesses of life for his own happiness with his own hands without resorting to the sexton ’ s spade that buried jacob marley but they didn ’ t devote the whole evening to music after a while they played at forfeits for it is good to be children sometimes and never better than at christmas when its mighty founder was a child himself stop there was first a game at blindman ’ s buff of course there was and i no more believe topper was really blind than i believe he had eyes in his boots my opinion is that it was a done thing between him and scrooge ’ s nephew and that the ghost of christmas present knew it the way he went after that plump sister in the lace tucker was an outrage on the credulity of human nature knocking down the fireirons tumbling over the chairs bumping against the piano smothering himself among the curtains wherever she went there went he he always knew where the plump sister was he wouldn ’ t catch anybody else if you had fallen up against him ( as some of them did ) on purpose he would have made a feint of endeavouring to seize you which would have been an affront to your understanding and would instantly have sidled off in the direction of the plump sister she often cried out that it wasn ’ t fair and it really was not but when at last he caught her when in spite of all her silken rustlings and her rapid flutterings past him he got her into a corner whence there was no escape then his conduct was the most execrable for his pretending not to know her his pretending that it was necessary to touch her headdress and further to assure himself of her identity by pressing a certain ring upon her finger and a certain chain about her neck was vile monstrous no doubt she told him her opinion of it when another blindman being in office they were so very confidential together behind the curtains scrooge ’ s niece was not one of the blindman ’ s buff party but was made comfortable with a large chair and a footstool in a snug corner where the ghost and scrooge were close behind her but she joined in the forfeits and loved her love to admiration with all the letters of the alphabet likewise at the game of how when and where she was very great and to the secret joy of scrooge ’ s nephew beat her sisters hollow though they were sharp girls too as topper could have told you there might have been twenty people there young and old but they all played and so did scrooge for wholly forgetting in the interest he had in what was going on that his voice made no sound in their ears he sometimes came out with his guess quite loud and very often guessed quite right too for the sharpest needle best whitechapel warranted not to cut in the eye was not sharper than scrooge blunt as he took it in his head to be the ghost was greatly pleased to find him in this mood and looked upon him with such favour that he begged like a boy to be allowed to stay until the guests departed but this the spirit said could not be done “ here is a new game ” said scrooge “ one half hour spirit only one ” it was a game called yes and no where scrooge ’ s nephew had to think of something and the rest must find out what he only answering to their questions yes or no as the case was the brisk fire of questioning to which he was exposed elicited from him that he was thinking of an animal a live animal rather a disagreeable animal a savage animal an animal that growled and grunted sometimes and talked sometimes and lived in london and walked about the streets and wasn ’ t made a show of and wasn ’ t led by anybody and didn ’ t live in a menagerie and was never killed in a market and was not a horse or an ass or a cow or a bull or a tiger or a dog or a pig or a cat or a bear at every fresh question that was put to him this nephew burst into a fresh roar of laughter and was so inexpressibly tickled that he was obliged to get up off the sofa and stamp at last the plump sister falling into a similar state cried out “ i have found it out i know what it is fred i know what it is ” “ what is it ” cried fred “ it ’ s your uncle scroooooge ” which it certainly was admiration was the universal sentiment though some objected that the reply to “ is it a bear ” ought to have been “ yes ” inasmuch as an answer in the negative was sufficient to have diverted their thoughts from mr scrooge supposing they had ever had any tendency that way"

   "there ” said the spirit laying it upon his heart “ and you shall be upheld in more than this ” as the words were spoken they passed through the wall and stood upon an open country road with fields on either hand the city had entirely vanished not a vestige of it was to be seen the darkness and the mist had vanished with it for it was a clear cold winter day with snow upon the ground “ good heaven ” said scrooge clasping his hands together as he looked about him “ i was bred in this place i was a boy here ” the spirit gazed upon him mildly its gentle touch though it had been light and instantaneous appeared still present to the old man ’ s sense of feeling he was conscious of a thousand odours floating in the air each one connected with a thousand thoughts and hopes and joys and cares long long forgotten “ your lip is trembling ” said the ghost “ and what is that upon your cheek ” scrooge muttered with an unusual catching in his voice that it was a pimple and begged the ghost to lead him where he would “ you recollect the way ” inquired the spirit “ remember it ” cried scrooge with fervour “ i could walk it blindfold ” “ strange to have forgotten it for so many years ” observed the ghost “ let us go on ” they walked along the road scrooge recognising every gate and post and tree until a little markettown appeared in the distance with its bridge its church and winding river some shaggy ponies now were seen trotting towards them with boys upon their backs who called to other boys in country gigs and carts driven by farmers all these boys were in great spirits and shouted to each other until the broad fields were so full of merry music that the crisp air laughed to hear it “ these are but shadows of the things that have been ” said the ghost “ they have no consciousness of us ” the jocund travellers came on and as they came scrooge knew and named them every one why was he rejoiced beyond all bounds to see them why did his cold eye glisten and his heart leap up as they went past why was he filled with gladness when he heard them give each other merry christmas as they parted at crossroads and byeways for their several homes what was merry christmas to scrooge out upon merry christmas what good had it ever done to him “ the school is not quite deserted ” said the ghost “ a solitary child neglected by his friends is left there still ” scrooge said he knew it and he sobbed they left the highroad by a wellremembered lane and soon approached a mansion of dull red brick with a little weathercocksurmounted cupola on the roof and a bell hanging in it it was a large house but one of broken fortunes for the spacious offices were little used their walls were damp and mossy their windows broken and their gates decayed fowls clucked and strutted in the stables and the coachhouses and sheds were overrun with grass nor was it more retentive of its ancient state within for entering the dreary hall and glancing through the open doors of many rooms they found them poorly furnished cold and vast there was an earthy savour in the air a chilly bareness in the place which associated itself somehow with too much getting up by candlelight and not too much to eat they went the ghost and scrooge across the hall to a door at the back of the house it opened before them and disclosed a long bare melancholy room made barer still by lines of plain deal forms and desks at one of these a lonely boy was reading near a feeble fire and scrooge sat down upon a form and wept to see his poor forgotten self as he used to be not a latent echo in the house not a squeak and scuffle from the mice behind the panelling not a drip from the halfthawed waterspout in the dull yard behind not a sigh among the leafless boughs of one despondent poplar not the idle swinging of an empty storehouse door no not a clicking in the fire but fell upon the heart of scrooge with a softening influence and gave a freer passage to his tears the spirit touched him on the arm and pointed to his younger self intent upon his reading suddenly a man in foreign garments wonderfully real and distinct to look at stood outside the window with an axe stuck in his belt and leading by the bridle an ass laden with wood “ why it ’ s ali baba ” scrooge exclaimed in ecstasy “ it ’ s dear old honest ali baba yes yes i know one christmas time when yonder solitary child was left here all alone he did come for the first time just like that poor boy and valentine ” said scrooge “ and his wild brother orson there they go and what ’ s his name who was put down in his drawers asleep at the gate of damascus don ’ t you see him and the sultan ’ s groom turned upside down by the genii there he is upon his head serve him right i ’ m glad of it what business had he to be married to the princess ” to hear scrooge expending all the earnestness of his nature on such subjects in a most extraordinary voice between laughing and crying and to see his heightened and excited face would have been a surprise to his business friends in the city indeed “ there ’ s the parrot ” cried scrooge “ green body and yellow tail with a thing like a lettuce growing out of the top of his head there he is poor robin crusoe he called him when he came home again after sailing round the island ‘ poor robin crusoe where have you been robin crusoe ’ the man thought he was dreaming but he wasn ’ t it was the parrot you know there goes friday running for his life to the little creek halloa hoop halloo ” then with a rapidity of transition very foreign to his usual character he said in pity for his former self “ poor boy ” and cried again “ i wish ” scrooge muttered putting his hand in his pocket and looking about him after drying his eyes with his cuff “ but it ’ s too late now ” “ what is the matter ” asked the spirit “ nothing ” said scrooge “ nothing there was a boy singing a christmas carol at my door last night i should like to have given him something that ’ s all ”"

mr scrooge ’ s nephew whom he had scarcely seen but once and who meeting him in the street that day and seeing that he looked a little “ just a little down you know ” said bob inquired what had
