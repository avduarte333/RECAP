   "here the flickering of the blaze showed preparations for a cosy dinner with hot plates baking through and through before the fire and deep red curtains ready to be drawn to shut out cold and darkness there all the children of the house were running out into the snow to meet their married sisters brothers cousins uncles aunts and be the first to greet them here again were shadows on the windowblind of guests assembling and there a group of handsome girls all hooded and furbooted and all chattering at once tripped lightly off to some near neighbour ’ s house where woe upon the single man who saw them enterartful witches well they knew itin a glow but if you had judged from the numbers of people on their way to friendly gatherings you might have thought that no one was at home to give them welcome when they got there instead of every house expecting company and piling up its fires halfchimney high blessings on it how the ghost exulted how it bared its breadth of breast and opened its capacious palm and floated on outpouring with a generous hand its bright and harmless mirth on everything within its reach the very lamplighter who ran on before dotting the dusky street with specks of light and who was dressed to spend the evening somewhere laughed out loudly as the spirit passed though little kenned the lamplighter that he had any company but christmas and now without a word of warning from the ghost they stood upon a bleak and desert moor where monstrous masses of rude stone were cast about as though it were the burialplace of giants and water spread itself wheresoever it listed or would have done so but for the frost that held it prisoner and nothing grew but moss and furze and coarse rank grass down in the west the setting sun had left a streak of fiery red which glared upon the desolation for an instant like a sullen eye and frowning lower lower lower yet was lost in the thick gloom of darkest night “ what place is this ” asked scrooge “ a place where miners live who labour in the bowels of the earth ” returned the spirit “ but they know me see ” a light shone from the window of a hut and swiftly they advanced towards it passing through the wall of mud and stone they found a cheerful company assembled round a glowing fire an old old man and woman with their children and their children ’ s children and another generation beyond that all decked out gaily in their holiday attire the old man in a voice that seldom rose above the howling of the wind upon the barren waste was singing them a christmas songit had been a very old song when he was a boyand from time to time they all joined in the chorus so surely as they raised their voices the old man got quite blithe and loud and so surely as they stopped his vigour sank again the spirit did not tarry here but bade scrooge hold his robe and passing on above the moor spedwhither not to sea to sea to scrooge ’ s horror looking back he saw the last of the land a frightful range of rocks behind them and his ears were deafened by the thundering of water as it rolled and roared and raged among the dreadful caverns it had worn and fiercely tried to undermine the earth built upon a dismal reef of sunken rocks some league or so from shore on which the waters chafed and dashed the wild year through there stood a solitary lighthouse great heaps of seaweed clung to its base and stormbirdsborn of the wind one might suppose as seaweed of the waterrose and fell about it like the waves they skimmed but even here two men who watched the light had made a fire that through the loophole in the thick stone wall shed out a ray of brightness on the awful sea joining their horny hands over the rough table at which they sat they wished each other merry christmas in their can of grog and one of them the elder too with his face all damaged and scarred with hard weather as the figurehead of an old ship might be struck up a sturdy song that was like a gale in itself again the ghost sped on above the black and heaving seaon onuntil being far away as he told scrooge from any shore they lighted on a ship they stood beside the helmsman at the wheel the lookout in the bow the officers who had the watch dark ghostly figures in their several stations but every man among them hummed a christmas tune or had a christmas thought or spoke below his breath to his companion of some bygone christmas day with homeward hopes belonging to it and every man on board waking or sleeping good or bad had had a kinder word for another on that day than on any day in the year and had shared to some extent in its festivities and had remembered those he cared for at a distance and had known that they delighted to remember him it was a great surprise to scrooge while listening to the moaning of the wind and thinking what a solemn thing it was to move on through the lonely darkness over an unknown abyss whose depths were secrets as profound as death it was a great surprise to scrooge while thus engaged to hear a hearty laugh it was a much greater surprise to scrooge to recognise it as his own nephew ’ s and to find himself in a bright dry gleaming room with the spirit standing smiling by his side and looking at that same nephew with approving affability “ ha ha ” laughed scrooge ’ s nephew “ ha ha ha ” if you should happen by any unlikely chance to know a man more blest in a laugh than scrooge ’ s nephew all i can say is i should like to know him too introduce him to me and i ’ ll cultivate his acquaintance it is a fair evenhanded noble adjustment of things that while there is infection in disease and sorrow there is nothing in the world so irresistibly contagious as laughter and goodhumour when scrooge ’ s nephew laughed in this way holding his sides rolling his head and twisting his face into the most extravagant contortions scrooge ’ s niece by marriage laughed as heartily as he and their assembled friends being not a bit behindhand roared out lustily “ ha ha ha ha ha ha ” “ he said that christmas was a humbug as i live ” cried scrooge ’ s nephew “ he believed it too ” “ more shame for him fred ” said scrooge ’ s niece indignantly bless those women they never do anything by halves they are always in earnest she was very pretty exceedingly pretty with a dimpled surprisedlooking capital face a ripe little mouth that seemed made to be kissedas no doubt it was all kinds of good little dots about her chin that melted into one another when she laughed and the sunniest pair of eyes you ever saw in any little creature ’ s head altogether she was what you would have called provoking you know but satisfactory too oh perfectly satisfactory “ he ’ s a comical old fellow ” said scrooge ’ s nephew “ that ’ s the truth and not so pleasant as he might be however his offences carry their own punishment and i have nothing to say against him ” “ i ’ m sure he is very rich fred ” hinted scrooge ’ s niece “ at least you always tell me so ” “ what of that my dear ” said scrooge ’ s nephew “ his wealth is of no use to him he don ’ t do any good with it he don ’ t make himself comfortable with it he hasn ’ t the satisfaction of thinkingha ha hathat he is ever going to benefit us with it ” “ i have no patience with him ” observed scrooge ’ s niece scrooge ’ s niece ’ s sisters and all the other ladies expressed the same opinion “ oh i have ” said scrooge ’ s nephew “ i am sorry for him i couldn ’ t be angry with him if i tried who suffers by his ill whims himself always here he takes it into his head to dislike us and he won ’ t come and dine with us what ’ s the consequence he don ’ t lose much of a dinner ” “ indeed i think he loses a very good dinner ” interrupted scrooge ’ s niece everybody else said the same and they must be allowed to have been competent judges because they had just had dinner and with the dessert upon the table were clustered round the fire by lamplight “ well i ’ m very glad to hear it ” said scrooge ’ s nephew “ because i haven ’ t great faith in these young housekeepers what do you say topper ” topper had clearly got his eye upon one of scrooge ’ s niece ’ s sisters for he answered that a bachelor was a wretched outcast who had no right to express an opinion on the subject whereat scrooge ’ s niece ’ s sisterthe plump one with the lace tucker not the one with the rosesblushed “ do go on fred ” said scrooge ’ s niece clapping her hands “ he never finishes what he begins to say he is such a ridiculous fellow ” scrooge ’ s nephew revelled in another laugh and as it was impossible to keep the infection off though the plump sister tried hard to do it with aromatic vinegar his example was unanimously followed “ i was only going to say ” said scrooge ’ s nephew “ that the consequence of his taking a dislike to us and not making merry with us is as i think that he loses some pleasant moments which could do him no harm i am sure he loses pleasanter companions than he can find in his own thoughts either in his mouldy old office or his dusty chambers i mean to give him the same chance every year whether he likes it or not for i pity him he may rail at christmas till he dies but he can ’ t help thinking better of iti defy himif he finds me going there in good temper year after year and saying uncle scrooge how are you if it only puts him in the vein to leave his poor clerk fifty pounds that ’ s something and i think i shook him yesterday ” it was their turn to laugh now at the notion of his shaking scrooge but being thoroughly goodnatured and not much caring what they laughed at so that they laughed at any rate he encouraged them in their merriment and passed the bottle joyously after tea they had some music for they were a musical family and knew what they were about when they sung a glee or catch i can assure you especially topper who could growl away in the bass like a good one and never swell the large veins in his forehead or get red in the face over it scrooge ’ s niece played well upon the harp and played among other tunes a simple little air ( a mere nothing you might learn to whistle it in two minutes ) which had been familiar to the child who fetched scrooge from the boardingschool as he had been reminded by the ghost of christmas past when this strain of music sounded all the things that ghost had shown him came upon his mind he softened more and more and thought that if he could have listened to it often years ago he might have cultivated the kindnesses of life for his own happiness with his own hands without resorting to the sexton ’ s spade that buried jacob marley but they didn ’ t devote the whole evening to music after a while they played at forfeits for it is good to be children sometimes and never better than at christmas when its mighty founder was a child himself stop there was first a game at blindman ’ s buff of course there was and i no more believe topper was really blind than i believe he had eyes in his boots my opinion is that it was a done thing between him and scrooge ’ s nephew and that the ghost of christmas present knew it the way he went after that plump sister in the lace tucker was an outrage on the credulity of human nature knocking down the fireirons tumbling over the chairs bumping against the piano smothering himself among the curtains wherever she went there went he he always knew where the plump sister was he wouldn ’ t catch anybody else if you had fallen up against him ( as some of them did ) on purpose he would have made a feint of endeavouring to seize you which would have been an affront to your understanding and would instantly have sidled off in the direction of the plump sister she often cried out that it wasn ’ t fair and it really was not but when at last he caught her when in spite of all her silken rustlings and her rapid flutterings past him he got her into a corner whence there was no escape then his conduct was the most execrable for his pretending not to know her his pretending that it was necessary to touch her headdress and further to assure himself of her identity by pressing a certain ring upon her finger and a certain chain about her neck was vile monstrous no doubt she told him her opinion of it when another blindman being in office they were so very confidential together behind the curtains scrooge ’ s niece was not one of the blindman ’ s buff party but was made comfortable with a large chair and a footstool in a snug corner where the ghost and scrooge were close behind her but she joined in the forfeits and loved her love to admiration with all the letters of the alphabet likewise at the game of how when and where she was very great and to the secret joy of scrooge ’ s nephew beat her sisters hollow though they were sharp girls too as topper could have told you there might have been twenty people there young and old but they all played and so did scrooge for wholly forgetting in the interest he had in what was going on that his voice made no sound in their ears he sometimes came out with his guess quite loud and very often guessed quite right too for the sharpest needle best whitechapel warranted not to cut in the eye was not sharper than scrooge blunt as he took it in his head to be the ghost was greatly pleased to find him in this mood and looked upon him with such favour that he begged like a boy to be allowed to stay until the guests departed but this the spirit said could not be done “ here is a new game ” said scrooge “ one half hour spirit only one ” it was a game called yes and no where scrooge ’ s nephew had to think of something and the rest must find out what he only answering to their questions yes or no as the case was the brisk fire of questioning to which he was exposed elicited from him that he was thinking of an animal a live animal rather a disagreeable animal a savage animal an animal that growled and grunted sometimes and talked sometimes and lived in london and walked about the streets and wasn ’ t made a show of and wasn ’ t led by anybody and didn ’ t live in a menagerie and was never killed in a market and was not a horse or an ass or a cow or a bull or a tiger or a dog or a pig or a cat or a bear at every fresh question that was put to him this nephew burst into a fresh roar of laughter and was so inexpressibly tickled that he was obliged to get up off the sofa and stamp at last the plump sister falling into a similar state cried out “ i have found it out i know what it is fred i know what it is ” “ what is it ” cried fred “ it ’ s your uncle scroooooge ” which it certainly was admiration was the universal sentiment though some objected that the reply to “ is it a bear ” ought to have been “ yes ” inasmuch as an answer in the negative was sufficient to have diverted their thoughts from mr scrooge supposing they had ever had any tendency that way"

   "it was made plain enough by the dressing of the shops that here too it was christmas time again but it was evening and the streets were lighted up the ghost stopped at a certain warehouse door and asked scrooge if he knew it “ know it ” said scrooge “ was i apprenticed here ” they went in at sight of an old gentleman in a welsh wig sitting behind such a high desk that if he had been two inches taller he must have knocked his head against the ceiling scrooge cried in great excitement “ why it ’ s old fezziwig bless his heart it ’ s fezziwig alive again ” old fezziwig laid down his pen and looked up at the clock which pointed to the hour of seven he rubbed his hands adjusted his capacious waistcoat laughed all over himself from his shoes to his organ of benevolence and called out in a comfortable oily rich fat jovial voice “ yo ho there ebenezer dick ” scrooge ’ s former self now grown a young man came briskly in accompanied by his fellow ’ prentice “ dick wilkins to be sure ” said scrooge to the ghost “ bless me yes there he is he was very much attached to me was dick poor dick dear dear ” “ yo ho my boys ” said fezziwig “ no more work tonight christmas eve dick christmas ebenezer let ’ s have the shutters up ” cried old fezziwig with a sharp clap of his hands “ before a man can say jack robinson ” you wouldn ’ t believe how those two fellows went at it they charged into the street with the shuttersone two threehad ’ em up in their placesfour five sixbarred ’ em and pinned ’ emseven eight nineand came back before you could have got to twelve panting like racehorses “ hilliho ” cried old fezziwig skipping down from the high desk with wonderful agility “ clear away my lads and let ’ s have lots of room here hilliho dick chirrup ebenezer ” clear away there was nothing they wouldn ’ t have cleared away or couldn ’ t have cleared away with old fezziwig looking on it was done in a minute every movable was packed off as if it were dismissed from public life for evermore the floor was swept and watered the lamps were trimmed fuel was heaped upon the fire and the warehouse was as snug and warm and dry and bright a ballroom as you would desire to see upon a winter ’ s night in came a fiddler with a musicbook and went up to the lofty desk and made an orchestra of it and tuned like fifty stomachaches in came mrs fezziwig one vast substantial smile in came the three miss fezziwigs beaming and lovable in came the six young followers whose hearts they broke in came all the young men and women employed in the business in came the housemaid with her cousin the baker in came the cook with her brother ’ s particular friend the milkman in came the boy from over the way who was suspected of not having board enough from his master trying to hide himself behind the girl from next door but one who was proved to have had her ears pulled by her mistress in they all came one after another some shyly some boldly some gracefully some awkwardly some pushing some pulling in they all came anyhow and everyhow away they all went twenty couple at once hands half round and back again the other way down the middle and up again round and round in various stages of affectionate grouping old top couple always turning up in the wrong place new top couple starting off again as soon as they got there all top couples at last and not a bottom one to help them when this result was brought about old fezziwig clapping his hands to stop the dance cried out “ well done ” and the fiddler plunged his hot face into a pot of porter especially provided for that purpose but scorning rest upon his reappearance he instantly began again though there were no dancers yet as if the other fiddler had been carried home exhausted on a shutter and he were a brannew man resolved to beat him out of sight or perish there were more dances and there were forfeits and more dances and there was cake and there was negus and there was a great piece of cold roast and there was a great piece of cold boiled and there were mincepies and plenty of beer but the great effect of the evening came after the roast and boiled when the fiddler ( an artful dog mind the sort of man who knew his business better than you or i could have told it him ) struck up “ sir roger de coverley ” then old fezziwig stood out to dance with mrs fezziwig top couple too with a good stiff piece of work cut out for them three or four and twenty pair of partners people who were not to be trifled with people who would dance and had no notion of walking but if they had been twice as manyah four timesold fezziwig would have been a match for them and so would mrs fezziwig as to her she was worthy to be his partner in every sense of the term if that ’ s not high praise tell me higher and i ’ ll use it a positive light appeared to issue from fezziwig ’ s calves they shone in every part of the dance like moons you couldn ’ t have predicted at any given time what would have become of them next and when old fezziwig and mrs fezziwig had gone all through the dance advance and retire both hands to your partner bow and curtsey corkscrew threadtheneedle and back again to your place fezziwig “ cut ” cut so deftly that he appeared to wink with his legs and came upon his feet again without a stagger when the clock struck eleven this domestic ball broke up mr and mrs fezziwig took their stations one on either side of the door and shaking hands with every person individually as he or she went out wished him or her a merry christmas when everybody had retired but the two ’ prentices they did the same to them and thus the cheerful voices died away and the lads were left to their beds which were under a counter in the backshop during the whole of this time scrooge had acted like a man out of his wits his heart and soul were in the scene and with his former self he corroborated everything remembered everything enjoyed everything and underwent the strangest agitation it was not until now when the bright faces of his former self and dick were turned from them that he remembered the ghost and became conscious that it was looking full upon him while the light upon its head burnt very clear “ a small matter ” said the ghost “ to make these silly folks so full of gratitude ” “ small ” echoed scrooge the spirit signed to him to listen to the two apprentices who were pouring out their hearts in praise of fezziwig and when he had done so said “ why is it not he has spent but a few pounds of your mortal money three or four perhaps is that so much that he deserves this praise ” “ it isn ’ t that ” said scrooge heated by the remark and speaking unconsciously like his former not his latter self “ it isn ’ t that spirit he has the power to render us happy or unhappy to make our service light or burdensome a pleasure or a toil say that his power lies in words and looks in things so slight and insignificant that it is impossible to add and count ’ em up what then the happiness he gives is quite as great as if it cost a fortune ” he felt the spirit ’ s glance and stopped “ what is the matter ” asked the ghost “ nothing particular ” said scrooge “ something i think ” the ghost insisted “ no ” said scrooge “ no i should like to be able to say a word or two to my clerk just now that ’ s all"

   "there ” said the spirit laying it upon his heart “ and you shall be upheld in more than this ” as the words were spoken they passed through the wall and stood upon an open country road with fields on either hand the city had entirely vanished not a vestige of it was to be seen the darkness and the mist had vanished with it for it was a clear cold winter day with snow upon the ground “ good heaven ” said scrooge clasping his hands together as he looked about him “ i was bred in this place i was a boy here ” the spirit gazed upon him mildly its gentle touch though it had been light and instantaneous appeared still present to the old man ’ s sense of feeling he was conscious of a thousand odours floating in the air each one connected with a thousand thoughts and hopes and joys and cares long long forgotten “ your lip is trembling ” said the ghost “ and what is that upon your cheek ” scrooge muttered with an unusual catching in his voice that it was a pimple and begged the ghost to lead him where he would “ you recollect the way ” inquired the spirit “ remember it ” cried scrooge with fervour “ i could walk it blindfold ” “ strange to have forgotten it for so many years ” observed the ghost “ let us go on ” they walked along the road scrooge recognising every gate and post and tree until a little markettown appeared in the distance with its bridge its church and winding river some shaggy ponies now were seen trotting towards them with boys upon their backs who called to other boys in country gigs and carts driven by farmers all these boys were in great spirits and shouted to each other until the broad fields were so full of merry music that the crisp air laughed to hear it “ these are but shadows of the things that have been ” said the ghost “ they have no consciousness of us ” the jocund travellers came on and as they came scrooge knew and named them every one why was he rejoiced beyond all bounds to see them why did his cold eye glisten and his heart leap up as they went past why was he filled with gladness when he heard them give each other merry christmas as they parted at crossroads and byeways for their several homes what was merry christmas to scrooge out upon merry christmas what good had it ever done to him “ the school is not quite deserted ” said the ghost “ a solitary child neglected by his friends is left there still ” scrooge said he knew it and he sobbed they left the highroad by a wellremembered lane and soon approached a mansion of dull red brick with a little weathercocksurmounted cupola on the roof and a bell hanging in it it was a large house but one of broken fortunes for the spacious offices were little used their walls were damp and mossy their windows broken and their gates decayed fowls clucked and strutted in the stables and the coachhouses and sheds were overrun with grass nor was it more retentive of its ancient state within for entering the dreary hall and glancing through the open doors of many rooms they found them poorly furnished cold and vast there was an earthy savour in the air a chilly bareness in the place which associated itself somehow with too much getting up by candlelight and not too much to eat they went the ghost and scrooge across the hall to a door at the back of the house it opened before them and disclosed a long bare melancholy room made barer still by lines of plain deal forms and desks at one of these a lonely boy was reading near a feeble fire and scrooge sat down upon a form and wept to see his poor forgotten self as he used to be not a latent echo in the house not a squeak and scuffle from the mice behind the panelling not a drip from the halfthawed waterspout in the dull yard behind not a sigh among the leafless boughs of one despondent poplar not the idle swinging of an empty storehouse door no not a clicking in the fire but fell upon the heart of scrooge with a softening influence and gave a freer passage to his tears the spirit touched him on the arm and pointed to his younger self intent upon his reading suddenly a man in foreign garments wonderfully real and distinct to look at stood outside the window with an axe stuck in his belt and leading by the bridle an ass laden with wood “ why it ’ s ali baba ” scrooge exclaimed in ecstasy “ it ’ s dear old honest ali baba yes yes i know one christmas time when yonder solitary child was left here all alone he did come for the first time just like that poor boy and valentine ” said scrooge “ and his wild brother orson there they go and what ’ s his name who was put down in his drawers asleep at the gate of damascus don ’ t you see him and the sultan ’ s groom turned upside down by the genii there he is upon his head serve him right i ’ m glad of it what business had he to be married to the princess ” to hear scrooge expending all the earnestness of his nature on such subjects in a most extraordinary voice between laughing and crying and to see his heightened and excited face would have been a surprise to his business friends in the city indeed “ there ’ s the parrot ” cried scrooge “ green body and yellow tail with a thing like a lettuce growing out of the top of his head there he is poor robin crusoe he called him when he came home again after sailing round the island ‘ poor robin crusoe where have you been robin crusoe ’ the man thought he was dreaming but he wasn ’ t it was the parrot you know there goes friday running for his life to the little creek halloa hoop halloo ” then with a rapidity of transition very foreign to his usual character he said in pity for his former self “ poor boy ” and cried again “ i wish ” scrooge muttered putting his hand in his pocket and looking about him after drying his eyes with his cuff “ but it ’ s too late now ” “ what is the matter ” asked the spirit “ nothing ” said scrooge “ nothing there was a boy singing a christmas carol at my door last night i should like to have given him something that ’ s all ”"

   "the ghost conducted him through several streets familiar to his feet and as they went along scrooge looked here and there to find himself but nowhere was he to be seen they entered poor bob cratchit ’ s house the dwelling he had visited before and found the mother and the children seated round the fire quiet very quiet the noisy little cratchits were as still as statues in one corner and sat looking up at peter who had a book before him the mother and her daughters were engaged in sewing but surely they were very quiet “ ‘ and he took a child and set him in the midst of them ’ ” where had scrooge heard those words he had not dreamed them the boy must have read them out as he and the spirit crossed the threshold why did he not go on the mother laid her work upon the table and put her hand up to her face “ the colour hurts my eyes ” she said the colour ah poor tiny tim “ they ’ re better now again ” said cratchit ’ s wife “ it makes them weak by candlelight and i wouldn ’ t show weak eyes to your father when he comes home for the world it must be near his time ” “ past it rather ” peter answered shutting up his book “ but i think he has walked a little slower than he used these few last evenings mother ” they were very quiet again at last she said and in a steady cheerful voice that only faltered once “ i have known him walk withi have known him walk with tiny tim upon his shoulder very fast indeed ” “ and so have i ” cried peter “ often ” “ and so have i ” exclaimed another so had all “ but he was very light to carry ” she resumed intent upon her work “ and his father loved him so that it was no trouble no trouble and there is your father at the door ” she hurried out to meet him and little bob in his comforterhe had need of it poor fellowcame in his tea was ready for him on the hob and they all tried who should help him to it most then the two young cratchits got upon his knees and laid each child a little cheek against his face as if they said “ don ’ t mind it father don ’ t be grieved ” bob was very cheerful with them and spoke pleasantly to all the family he looked at the work upon the table and praised the industry and speed of mrs cratchit and the girls they would be done long before sunday he said “ sunday you went today then robert ” said his wife “ yes my dear ” returned bob “ i wish you could have gone it would have done you good to see how green a place it is but you ’ ll see it often i promised him that i would walk there on a sunday my little little child ” cried bob “ my little child ” he broke down all at once he couldn ’ t help it if he could have helped it he and his child would have been farther apart perhaps than they were he left the room and went upstairs into the room above which was lighted cheerfully and hung with christmas there was a chair set close beside the child and there were signs of some one having been there lately poor bob sat down in it and when he had thought a little and composed himself he kissed the little face he was reconciled to what had happened and went down again quite happy they drew about the fire and talked the girls and mother working still bob told them of the extraordinary kindness of mr scrooge ’ s nephew whom he had scarcely seen but once and who meeting him in the street that day and seeing that he looked a little “ just a little down you know ” said bob inquired what had happened to distress him “ on which ” said bob “ for he is the pleasantestspoken gentleman you ever heard i told him ‘ i am heartily sorry for it mr cratchit ’ he said ‘ and heartily sorry for your good wife ’ by the bye how he ever knew that i don ’ t know ” “ knew what my dear ” “ why that you were a good wife ” replied bob “ everybody knows that ” said peter “ very well observed my boy ” cried bob “ i hope they do ‘ heartily sorry ’ he said ‘ for your good wife if i can be of service to you in any way ’ he said giving me his card ‘ that ’ s where i live pray come to me ’ now it wasn ’ t ” cried bob “ for the sake of anything he might be able to do for us so much as for his kind way that this was quite delightful it really seemed as if he had known our tiny tim and felt with us ” “ i ’ m sure he ’ s a good soul ” said mrs cratchit “ you would be surer of it my dear ” returned bob “ if you saw and spoke to him i shouldn ’ t be at all surprisedmark what i sayif he got peter a better situation ” “ only hear that peter ” said mrs cratchit “ and then ” cried one of the girls “ peter will be keeping company with some one and setting up for himself ” “ get along with you ” retorted peter grinning “ it ’ s just as likely as not ” said bob “ one of these days though there ’ s plenty of time for that my dear but however and whenever we part from one another i am sure we shall none of us forget poor tiny timshall weor this first parting that there was among us ” “ never"

   "for the people who were shovelling away on the housetops were jovial and full of glee calling out to one another from the parapets and now and then exchanging a facetious snowballbetternatured missile far than many a wordy jestlaughing heartily if it went right and not less heartily if it went wrong the poulterers ’ shops were still half open and the fruiterers ’ were radiant in their glory there were great round potbellied baskets of chestnuts shaped like the waistcoats of jolly old gentlemen lolling at the doors and tumbling out into the street in their apoplectic opulence there were ruddy brownfaced broadgirthed spanish onions shining in the fatness of their growth like spanish friars and winking from their shelves in wanton slyness at the girls as they went by and glanced demurely at the hungup mistletoe there were pears and apples clustered high in blooming pyramids there were bunches of grapes made in the shopkeepers ’ benevolence to dangle from conspicuous hooks that people ’ s mouths might water gratis as they passed there were piles of filberts mossy and brown recalling in their fragrance ancient walks among the woods and pleasant shufflings ankle deep through withered leaves there were norfolk biffins squat and swarthy setting off the yellow of the oranges and lemons and in the great compactness of their juicy persons urgently entreating and beseeching to be carried home in paper bags and eaten after dinner the very gold and silver fish set forth among these choice fruits in a bowl though members of a dull and stagnantblooded race appeared to know that there was something going on and to a fish went gasping round and round their little world in slow and passionless excitement the grocers ’ oh the grocers ’ nearly closed with perhaps two shutters down or one but through those gaps such glimpses it was not alone that the scales descending on the counter made a merry sound or that the twine and roller parted company so briskly or that the canisters were rattled up and down like juggling tricks or even that the blended scents of tea and coffee were so grateful to the nose or even that the raisins were so plentiful and rare the almonds so extremely white the sticks of cinnamon so long and straight the other spices so delicious the candied fruits so caked and spotted with molten sugar as to make the coldest lookerson feel faint and subsequently bilious nor was it that the figs were moist and pulpy or that the french plums blushed in modest tartness from their highlydecorated boxes or that everything was good to eat and in its christmas dress but the customers were all so hurried and so eager in the hopeful promise of the day that they tumbled up against each other at the door crashing their wicker baskets wildly and left their purchases upon the counter and came running back to fetch them and committed hundreds of the like mistakes in the best humour possible while the grocer and his people were so frank and fresh that the polished hearts with which they fastened their aprons behind might have been their own worn outside for general inspection and for christmas daws to peck at if they chose but soon the steeples called good people all to church and chapel and away they came flocking through the streets in their best clothes and with their gayest faces and at the same time there emerged from scores of byestreets lanes and nameless turnings innumerable people carrying their dinners to the bakers ’ shops the sight of these poor revellers appeared to interest the spirit very much for he stood with scrooge beside him in a baker ’ s doorway and taking off the covers as their bearers passed sprinkled incense on their dinners from his torch and it was a very uncommon kind of torch for once or twice when there were angry words between some dinnercarriers who had jostled each other he shed a few drops of water on them from it and their good humour was restored directly for they said it was a shame to quarrel upon christmas day and so it was god love it so it was in time the bells ceased and the bakers were shut up and yet there was a genial shadowing forth of all these dinners and the progress of their cooking in the thawed blotch of wet above each baker ’ s oven where the pavement smoked as if its stones were cooking too “ is there a peculiar flavour in what you sprinkle from your torch ” asked scrooge “ there is my own ” “ would it apply to any kind of dinner on this day ” asked scrooge “ to any kindly given to a poor one most ” “ why to a poor one most ” asked scrooge “ because it needs it most ” “ spirit ” said scrooge after a moment ’ s thought “ i wonder you of all the beings in the many worlds about us should desire to cramp these people ’ s opportunities of innocent enjoyment ” “ i ” cried the spirit “ you would deprive them of their means of dining every seventh day often the only day on which they can be said to dine at all ” said scrooge “ wouldn ’ t you ” “ i ” cried the spirit “ you seek to close these places on the seventh day ” said scrooge “ and it comes to the same thing ” “ i seek ” exclaimed the spirit “ forgive me if i am wrong it has been done in your name or at least in that of your family ” said scrooge “ there are some upon this earth of yours ” returned the spirit “ who lay claim to know us and who do their deeds of passion pride illwill hatred envy bigotry and selfishness in our name who are as strange to us and all our kith and kin as if they had never lived remember that and charge their doings on themselves not us"
