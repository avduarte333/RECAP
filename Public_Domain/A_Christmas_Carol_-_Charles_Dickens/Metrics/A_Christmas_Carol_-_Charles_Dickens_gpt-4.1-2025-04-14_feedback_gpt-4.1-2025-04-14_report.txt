   "it was the voice of scrooge ’ s nephew who came upon him so quickly that this was the first intimation he had of his approach “ bah ” said scrooge “ humbug ” he had so heated himself with rapid walking in the fog and frost this nephew of scrooge ’ s that he was all in a glow his face was ruddy and handsome his eyes sparkled and his breath smoked again “ christmas a humbug uncle ” said scrooge ’ s nephew “ you don ’ t mean that i am sure ” “ i do ” said scrooge “ merry christmas what right have you to be merry what reason have you to be merry you ’ re poor enough ” “ come then ” returned the nephew gaily “ what right have you to be dismal what reason have you to be morose you ’ re rich enough ” scrooge having no better answer ready on the spur of the moment said “ bah ” again and followed it up with “ humbug ” “ don ’ t be cross uncle ” said the nephew “ what else can i be ” returned the uncle “ when i live in such a world of fools as this merry christmas out upon merry christmas what ’ s christmas time to you but a time for paying bills without money a time for finding yourself a year older but not an hour richer a time for balancing your books and having every item in ’ em through a round dozen of months presented dead against you if i could work my will ” said scrooge indignantly “ every idiot who goes about with ‘ merry christmas ’ on his lips should be boiled with his own pudding and buried with a stake of holly through his heart he should ” “ uncle ” pleaded the nephew “ nephew ” returned the uncle sternly “ keep christmas in your own way and let me keep it in mine ” “ keep it ” repeated scrooge ’ s nephew “ but you don ’ t keep it ” “ let me leave it alone then ” said scrooge “ much good may it do you much good it has ever done you ” “ there are many things from which i might have derived good by which i have not profited i dare say ” returned the nephew “ christmas among the rest but i am sure i have always thought of christmas time when it has come roundapart from the veneration due to its sacred name and origin if anything belonging to it can be apart from thatas a good time a kind forgiving charitable pleasant time the only time i know of in the long calendar of the year when men and women seem by one consent to open their shutup hearts freely and to think of people below them as if they really were fellowpassengers to the grave and not another race of creatures bound on other journeys and therefore uncle though it has never put a scrap of gold or silver in my pocket i believe that it has done me good and will do me good and i say god bless it ” the clerk in the tank involuntarily applauded becoming immediately sensible of the impropriety he poked the fire and extinguished the last frail spark for ever “ let me hear another sound from you ” said scrooge “ and you ’ ll keep your christmas by losing your situation you ’ re quite a powerful speaker sir ” he added turning to his nephew “ i wonder you don ’ t go into parliament ” “ don ’ t be angry uncle come dine with us tomorrow ” scrooge said that he would see himyes indeed he did he went the whole length of the expression and said that he would see him in that extremity first “ but why ” cried scrooge ’ s nephew “ why ” “ why did you get married ” said scrooge “ because i fell in love ” “ because you fell in love ” growled scrooge as if that were the only one thing in the world more ridiculous than a merry christmas “ good afternoon ” “ nay uncle but you never came to see me before that happened why give it as a reason for not coming now ” “ good afternoon ” said scrooge “ i want nothing from you i ask nothing of you why can not we be friends ” “ good afternoon ” said scrooge “ i am sorry with all my heart to find you so resolute we have never had any quarrel to which i have been a party but i have made the trial in homage to christmas and i ’ ll keep my christmas humour to the last so a merry christmas uncle ” “ good afternoon ” said scrooge “ and a happy new year ” “ good afternoon ” said scrooge his nephew left the room without an angry word notwithstanding he stopped at the outer door to bestow the greetings of the season on the clerk who cold as he was was warmer than scrooge for he returned them cordially “ there ’ s another fellow ” muttered scrooge who overheard him “ my clerk with fifteen shillings a week and a wife and family talking about a merry christmas i ’ ll retire to bedlam ” this lunatic in letting scrooge ’ s nephew out had let two other people in they were portly gentlemen pleasant to behold and now stood with their hats off in scrooge ’ s office they had books and papers in their hands and bowed to him “ scrooge and marley ’ s i believe ” said one of the gentlemen referring to his list “ have i the pleasure of addressing mr scrooge or mr marley ” “ mr marley has been dead these seven years ” scrooge replied “ he died seven years ago this very night ” “ we have no doubt his liberality is well represented by his surviving partner ” said the gentleman presenting his credentials it certainly was for they had been two kindred spirits at the ominous word “ liberality ” scrooge frowned and shook his head and handed the credentials back “ at this festive season of the year mr scrooge ” said the gentleman taking up a pen “ it is more than usually desirable that we should make some slight provision for the poor and destitute who suffer greatly at the present time many thousands are in want of common necessaries hundreds of thousands are in want of common comforts sir ” “ are there no prisons ” asked scrooge “ plenty of prisons ” said the gentleman laying down the pen again “ and the union workhouses ” demanded scrooge “ are they still in operation ” “ they are still ” returned the gentleman “ i wish i could say they were not ” “ the treadmill and the poor law are in full vigour then ” said scrooge “ both very busy sir ” “ oh i was afraid from what you said at first that something had occurred to stop them in their useful course ” said scrooge “ i ’ m very glad to hear it ” “ under the impression that they scarcely furnish christian cheer of mind or body to the multitude ” returned the gentleman “ a few of us are endeavouring to raise a fund to buy the poor some meat and drink and means of warmth we choose this time because it is a time of all others when want is keenly felt and abundance rejoices what shall i put you down for ” “ nothing ” scrooge replied “ you wish to be anonymous ” “ i wish to be left alone ” said scrooge “ since you ask me what i wish gentlemen that is my answer i don ’ t make merry myself at christmas and i can ’ t afford to make idle people merry i help to support the establishments i have mentionedthey cost enough and those who are badly off must go there ” “ many can ’ t go there and many would rather die ” “ if they would rather die ” said scrooge “ they had better do it and decrease the surplus population besidesexcuse mei don ’ t know that ” “ but you might know it ” observed the gentleman “ it ’ s not my business ” scrooge returned “ it ’ s enough for a man to understand his own business and not to interfere with other people ’ s mine occupies me constantly good afternoon gentlemen ” seeing clearly that it would be useless to pursue their point the gentlemen withdrew scrooge resumed his labours with an improved opinion of himself and in a more facetious temper than was usual with him"

   "“ one shadow more ” exclaimed the ghost “ no more ” cried scrooge “ no more i don ’ t wish to see it show me no more ” but the relentless ghost pinioned him in both his arms and forced him to observe what happened next they were in another scene and place a room not very large or handsome but full of comfort near to the winter fire sat a beautiful young girl so like that last that scrooge believed it was the same until he saw her now a comely matron sitting opposite her daughter the noise in this room was perfectly tumultuous for there were more children there than scrooge in his agitated state of mind could count and unlike the celebrated herd in the poem they were not forty children conducting themselves like one but every child was conducting itself like forty the consequences were uproarious beyond belief but no one seemed to care on the contrary the mother and daughter laughed heartily and enjoyed it very much and the latter soon beginning to mingle in the sports got pillaged by the young brigands most ruthlessly what would i not have given to be one of them though i never could have been so rude no no i wouldn ’ t for the wealth of all the world have crushed that braided hair and torn it down and for the precious little shoe i wouldn ’ t have plucked it off god bless my soul to save my life as to measuring her waist in sport as they did bold young brood i couldn ’ t have done it i should have expected my arm to have grown round it for a punishment and never come straight again and yet i should have dearly liked i own to have touched her lips to have questioned her that she might have opened them to have looked upon the lashes of her downcast eyes and never raised a blush to have let loose waves of hair an inch of which would be a keepsake beyond price in short i should have liked i do confess to have had the lightest licence of a child and yet to have been man enough to know its value but now a knocking at the door was heard and such a rush immediately ensued that she with laughing face and plundered dress was borne towards it the centre of a flushed and boisterous group just in time to greet the father who came home attended by a man laden with christmas toys and presents then the shouting and the struggling and the onslaught that was made on the defenceless porter the scaling him with chairs for ladders to dive into his pockets despoil him of brownpaper parcels hold on tight by his cravat hug him round his neck pommel his back and kick his legs in irrepressible affection the shouts of wonder and delight with which the development of every package was received the terrible announcement that the baby had been taken in the act of putting a doll ’ s fryingpan into his mouth and was more than suspected of having swallowed a fictitious turkey glued on a wooden platter the immense relief of finding this a false alarm the joy and gratitude and ecstasy they are all indescribable alike it is enough that by degrees the children and their emotions got out of the parlour and by one stair at a time up to the top of the house where they went to bed and so subsided and now scrooge looked on more attentively than ever when the master of the house having his daughter leaning fondly on him sat down with her and her mother at his own fireside and when he thought that such another creature quite as graceful and as full of promise might have called him father and been a springtime in the haggard winter of his life his sight grew very dim indeed “ belle ” said the husband turning to his wife with a smile “ i saw an old friend of yours this afternoon ” “ who was it ” “ guess ” “ how can i tut don ’ t i know ” she added in the same breath laughing as he laughed “ mr scrooge ” “ mr scrooge it was i passed his office window and as it was not shut up and he had a candle inside i could scarcely help seeing him his partner lies upon the point of death i hear and there he sat alone quite alone in the world i do believe ” “ spirit ” said scrooge in a broken voice “ remove me from this place ” “ i told you these were shadows of the things that have been ” said the ghost “ that they are what they are do not blame me ” “ remove me ” scrooge exclaimed “ i can not bear it ” he turned upon the ghost and seeing that it looked upon him with a face in which in some strange way there were fragments of all the faces it had shown him wrestled with it “ leave me take me back haunt me no longer ” in the struggle if that can be called a struggle in which the ghost with no visible resistance on its own part was undisturbed by any effort of its adversary scrooge observed that its light was burning high and bright and dimly connecting that with its influence over him he seized the extinguishercap and by a sudden action pressed it down upon its head the spirit dropped beneath it so that the extinguisher covered its whole form but though scrooge pressed it down with all his force he could not hide the light which streamed from under it in an unbroken flood upon the ground he was conscious of being exhausted and overcome by an irresistible drowsiness and further of being in his own bedroom he gave the cap a parting squeeze in which his hand relaxed and had barely time to reel to bed before he sank into a heavy"

   "it was a remarkable quality of the ghost ( which scrooge had observed at the baker ’ s ) that notwithstanding his gigantic size he could accommodate himself to any place with ease and that he stood beneath a low roof quite as gracefully and like a supernatural creature as it was possible he could have done in any lofty hall and perhaps it was the pleasure the good spirit had in showing off this power of his or else it was his own kind generous hearty nature and his sympathy with all poor men that led him straight to scrooge ’ s clerk ’ s for there he went and took scrooge with him holding to his robe and on the threshold of the door the spirit smiled and stopped to bless bob cratchit ’ s dwelling with the sprinkling of his torch think of that bob had but fifteen “ bob ” aweek himself he pocketed on saturdays but fifteen copies of his christian name and yet the ghost of christmas present blessed his fourroomed house then up rose mrs cratchit cratchit ’ s wife dressed out but poorly in a twiceturned gown but brave in ribbons which are cheap and make a goodly show for sixpence and she laid the cloth assisted by belinda cratchit second of her daughters also brave in ribbons while master peter cratchit plunged a fork into the saucepan of potatoes and getting the corners of his monstrous shirt collar ( bob ’ s private property conferred upon his son and heir in honour of the day ) into his mouth rejoiced to find himself so gallantly attired and yearned to show his linen in the fashionable parks and now two smaller cratchits boy and girl came tearing in screaming that outside the baker ’ s they had smelt the goose and known it for their own and basking in luxurious thoughts of sage and onion these young cratchits danced about the table and exalted master peter cratchit to the skies while he ( not proud although his collars nearly choked him ) blew the fire until the slow potatoes bubbling up knocked loudly at the saucepanlid to be let out and peeled “ what has ever got your precious father then ” said mrs cratchit “ and your brother tiny tim and martha warn ’ t as late last christmas day by halfanhour ” “ here ’ s martha mother ” said a girl appearing as she spoke “ here ’ s martha mother ” cried the two young cratchits “ hurrah there ’ s such a goose martha ” “ why bless your heart alive my dear how late you are ” said mrs cratchit kissing her a dozen times and taking off her shawl and bonnet for her with officious zeal “ we ’ d a deal of work to finish up last night ” replied the girl “ and had to clear away this morning mother ” “ well never mind so long as you are come ” said mrs cratchit “ sit ye down before the fire my dear and have a warm lord bless ye ” “ no no there ’ s father coming ” cried the two young cratchits who were everywhere at once “ hide martha hide ” so martha hid herself and in came little bob the father with at least three feet of comforter exclusive of the fringe hanging down before him and his threadbare clothes darned up and brushed to look seasonable and tiny tim upon his shoulder alas for tiny tim he bore a little crutch and had his limbs supported by an iron frame “ why where ’ s our martha ” cried bob cratchit looking round “ not coming ” said mrs cratchit “ not coming ” said bob with a sudden declension in his high spirits for he had been tim ’ s blood horse all the way from church and had come home rampant “ not coming upon christmas day ” martha didn ’ t like to see him disappointed if it were only in joke so she came out prematurely from behind the closet door and ran into his arms while the two young cratchits hustled tiny tim and bore him off into the washhouse that he might hear the pudding singing in the copper “ and how did little tim behave ” asked mrs cratchit when she had rallied bob on his credulity and bob had hugged his daughter to his heart ’ s content “ as good as gold ” said bob “ and better somehow he gets thoughtful sitting by himself so much and thinks the strangest things you ever heard he told me coming home that he hoped the people saw him in the church because he was a cripple and it might be pleasant to them to remember upon christmas day who made lame beggars walk and blind men see ” bob ’ s voice was tremulous when he told them this and trembled more when he said that tiny tim was growing strong and hearty his active little crutch was heard upon the floor and back came tiny tim before another word was spoken escorted by his brother and sister to his stool before the fire and while bob turning up his cuffsas if poor fellow they were capable of being made more shabbycompounded some hot mixture in a jug with gin and lemons and stirred it round and round and put it on the hob to simmer master peter and the two ubiquitous young cratchits went to fetch the goose with which they soon returned in high procession"

   "you may be an undigested bit of beef a blot of mustard a crumb of cheese a fragment of an underdone potato there ’ s more of gravy than of grave about you whatever you are ” scrooge was not much in the habit of cracking jokes nor did he feel in his heart by any means waggish then the truth is that he tried to be smart as a means of distracting his own attention and keeping down his terror for the spectre ’ s voice disturbed the very marrow in his bones to sit staring at those fixed glazed eyes in silence for a moment would play scrooge felt the very deuce with him there was something very awful too in the spectre ’ s being provided with an infernal atmosphere of its own scrooge could not feel it himself but this was clearly the case for though the ghost sat perfectly motionless its hair and skirts and tassels were still agitated as by the hot vapour from an oven “ you see this toothpick ” said scrooge returning quickly to the charge for the reason just assigned and wishing though it were only for a second to divert the vision ’ s stony gaze from himself “ i do ” replied the ghost “ you are not looking at it ” said scrooge “ but i see it ” said the ghost “ notwithstanding ” “ well ” returned scrooge “ i have but to swallow this and be for the rest of my days persecuted by a legion of goblins all of my own creation humbug i tell you humbug ” at this the spirit raised a frightful cry and shook its chain with such a dismal and appalling noise that scrooge held on tight to his chair to save himself from falling in a swoon but how much greater was his horror when the phantom taking off the bandage round its head as if it were too warm to wear indoors its lower jaw dropped down upon its breast scrooge fell upon his knees and clasped his hands before his face “ mercy ” he said “ dreadful apparition why do you trouble me ” “ man of the worldly mind ” replied the ghost “ do you believe in me or not ” “ i do ” said scrooge “ i must but why do spirits walk the earth and why do they come to me ” “ it is required of every man ” the ghost returned “ that the spirit within him should walk abroad among his fellowmen and travel far and wide and if that spirit goes not forth in life it is condemned to do so after death it is doomed to wander through the worldoh woe is meand witness what it can not share but might have shared on earth and turned to happiness ” again the spectre raised a cry and shook its chain and wrung its shadowy hands “ you are fettered ” said scrooge trembling “ tell me why ” “ i wear the chain i forged in life ” replied the ghost “ i made it link by link and yard by yard i girded it on of my own free will and of my own free will i wore it is its pattern strange to you ” scrooge trembled more and more “ or would you know ” pursued the ghost “ the weight and length of the strong coil you bear yourself it was full as heavy and as long as this seven christmas eves ago you have laboured on it since it is a ponderous chain ” scrooge glanced about him on the floor in the expectation of finding himself surrounded by some fifty or sixty fathoms of iron cable but he could see nothing “ jacob ” he said imploringly “ old jacob marley tell me more speak comfort to me jacob ” “ i have none to give ” the ghost replied “ it comes from other regions ebenezer scrooge and is conveyed by other ministers to other kinds of men nor can i tell you what i would a very little more is all permitted to me i can not rest i can not stay i can not linger anywhere my spirit never walked beyond our countinghousemark mein life my spirit never roved beyond the narrow limits of our moneychanging hole and weary journeys lie before me ” it"
