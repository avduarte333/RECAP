   "here the flickering of the blaze showed preparations for a cosy dinner with hot plates baking through and through before the fire and deep red curtains ready to be drawn to shut out cold and darkness there all the children of the house were running out into the snow to meet their married sisters brothers cousins uncles aunts and be the first to greet them here again were shadows on the windowblind of guests assembling and there a group of handsome girls all hooded and furbooted and all chattering at once tripped lightly off to some near neighbour ’ s house where woe upon the single man who saw them enterartful witches well they knew itin a glow but if you had judged from the numbers of people on their way to friendly gatherings you might have thought that no one was at home to give them welcome when they got there instead of every house expecting company and piling up its fires halfchimney high blessings on it how the ghost exulted how it bared its breadth of breast and opened its capacious palm and floated on outpouring with a generous hand its bright and harmless mirth on everything within its reach the very lamplighter who ran on before dotting the dusky street with specks of light and who was dressed to spend the evening somewhere laughed out loudly as the spirit passed though little kenned the lamplighter that he had any company but christmas and now without a word of warning from the ghost they stood upon a bleak and desert moor where monstrous masses of rude stone were cast about as though it were the burialplace of giants and water spread itself wheresoever it listed or would have done so but for the frost that held it prisoner and nothing grew but moss and furze and coarse rank grass down in the west the setting sun had left a streak of fiery red which glared upon the desolation for an instant like a sullen eye and frowning lower lower lower yet was lost in the thick gloom of darkest night “ what place is this ” asked scrooge “ a place where miners live who labour in the bowels of the earth ” returned the spirit “ but they know me see ” a light shone from the window of a hut and swiftly they advanced towards it passing through the wall of mud and stone they found a cheerful company assembled round a glowing fire an old old man and woman with their children and their children ’ s children and another generation beyond that all decked out gaily in their holiday attire the old man in a voice that seldom rose above the howling of the wind upon the barren waste was singing them a christmas songit had been a very old song when he was a boyand from time to time they all joined in the chorus so surely as they raised their voices the old man got quite blithe and loud and so surely as they stopped his vigour sank again the spirit did not tarry here but bade scrooge hold his robe and passing on above the moor spedwhither not to sea to sea to scrooge ’ s horror looking back he saw the last of the land a frightful range of rocks behind them and his ears were deafened by the thundering of water as it rolled and roared and raged among the dreadful caverns it had worn and fiercely tried to undermine the earth built upon a dismal reef of sunken rocks some league or so from shore on which the waters chafed and dashed the wild year through there stood a solitary lighthouse great heaps of seaweed clung to its base and stormbirdsborn of the wind one might suppose as seaweed of the waterrose and fell about it like the waves they skimmed but even here two men who watched the light had made a fire that through the loophole in the thick stone wall shed out a ray of brightness on the awful sea joining their horny hands over the rough table at which they sat they wished each other merry christmas in their can of grog and one of them the elder too with his face all damaged and scarred with hard weather as the figurehead of an old ship might be struck up a sturdy song that was like a gale in itself again the ghost sped on above the black and heaving seaon onuntil being far away as he told scrooge from any shore they lighted on a ship they stood beside the helmsman at the wheel the lookout in the bow the officers who had the watch dark ghostly figures in their several stations but every man among them hummed a christmas tune or had a christmas thought or spoke below his breath to his companion of some bygone christmas day with homeward hopes belonging to it and every man on board waking or sleeping good or bad had had a kinder word for another on that day than on any day in the year and had shared to some extent in its festivities and had remembered those he cared for at a distance and had known that they delighted to remember him it was a great surprise to scrooge while listening to the moaning of the wind and thinking what a solemn thing it was to move on through the lonely darkness over an unknown abyss whose depths were secrets as profound as death it was a great surprise to scrooge while thus engaged to hear a hearty laugh it was a much greater surprise to scrooge to recognise it as his own nephew ’ s and to find himself in a bright dry gleaming room with the spirit standing smiling by his side and looking at that same nephew with approving affability “ ha ha ” laughed scrooge ’ s nephew “ ha ha ha ” if you should happen by any unlikely chance to know a man more blest in a laugh than scrooge ’ s nephew all i can say is i should like to know him too introduce him to me and i ’ ll cultivate his acquaintance it is a fair evenhanded noble adjustment of things that while there is infection in disease and sorrow there is nothing in the world so irresistibly contagious as laughter and goodhumour when scrooge ’ s nephew laughed in this way holding his sides rolling his head and twisting his face into the most extravagant contortions scrooge ’ s niece by marriage laughed as heartily as he and their assembled friends being not a bit behindhand roared out lustily “ ha ha ha ha ha ha ” “ he said that christmas was a humbug as i live ” cried scrooge ’ s nephew “ he believed it too ” “ more shame for him fred ” said scrooge ’ s niece indignantly bless those women they never do anything by halves they are always in earnest she was very pretty exceedingly pretty with a dimpled surprisedlooking capital face a ripe little mouth that seemed made to be kissedas no doubt it was all kinds of good little dots about her chin that melted into one another when she laughed and the sunniest pair of eyes you ever saw in any little creature ’ s head altogether she was what you would have called provoking you know but satisfactory too oh perfectly satisfactory “ he ’ s a comical old fellow ” said scrooge ’ s nephew “ that ’ s the truth and not so pleasant as he might be however his offences carry their own punishment and i have nothing to say against him ” “ i ’ m sure he is very rich fred ” hinted scrooge ’ s niece “ at least you always tell me so ” “ what of that my dear ” said scrooge ’ s nephew “ his wealth is of no use to him he don ’ t do any good with it he don ’ t make himself comfortable with it he hasn ’ t the satisfaction of thinkingha ha hathat he is ever going to benefit us with it ” “ i have no patience with him ” observed scrooge ’ s niece scrooge ’ s niece ’ s sisters and all the other ladies expressed the same opinion “ oh i have ” said scrooge ’ s nephew “ i am sorry for him i couldn ’ t be angry with him if i tried who suffers by his ill whims himself always here he takes it into his head to dislike us and he won ’ t come and dine with us what ’ s the consequence he don ’ t lose much of a dinner ” “ indeed i think he loses a very good dinner ” interrupted scrooge ’ s niece everybody else said the same and they must be allowed to have been competent judges because they had just had dinner and with the dessert upon the table were clustered round the fire by lamplight “ well i ’ m very glad to hear it ” said scrooge ’ s nephew “ because i haven ’ t great faith in these young housekeepers what do you say topper ” topper had clearly got his eye upon one of scrooge ’ s niece ’ s sisters for he answered that a bachelor was a wretched outcast who had no right to express an opinion on the subject whereat scrooge ’ s niece ’ s sisterthe plump one with the lace tucker not the one with the rosesblushed “ do go on fred ” said scrooge ’ s niece clapping her hands “ he never finishes what he begins to say he is such a ridiculous fellow ” scrooge ’ s nephew revelled in another laugh and as it was impossible to keep the infection off though the plump sister tried hard to do it with aromatic vinegar his example was unanimously followed “ i was only going to say ” said scrooge ’ s nephew “ that the consequence of his taking a dislike to us and not making merry with us is as i think that he loses some pleasant moments which could do him no harm i am sure he loses pleasanter companions than he can find in his own thoughts either in his mouldy old office or his dusty chambers i mean to give him the same chance every year whether he likes it or not for i pity him he may rail at christmas till he dies but he can ’ t help thinking better of iti defy himif he finds me going there in good temper year after year and saying uncle scrooge how are you if it only puts him in the vein to leave his poor clerk fifty pounds that ’ s something and i think i shook him yesterday ” it was their turn to laugh now at the notion of his shaking scrooge but being thoroughly goodnatured and not much caring what they laughed at so that they laughed at any rate he encouraged them in their merriment and passed the bottle joyously after tea they had some music for they were a musical family and knew what they were about when they sung a glee or catch i can assure you especially topper who could growl away in the bass like a good one and never swell the large veins in his forehead or get red in the face over it scrooge ’ s niece played well upon the harp and played among other tunes a simple little air ( a mere nothing you might learn to whistle it in two minutes ) which had been familiar to the child who fetched scrooge from the boardingschool as he had been reminded by the ghost of christmas past when this strain"

   "his face was ruddy and handsome his eyes sparkled and his breath smoked again “ christmas a humbug uncle ” said scrooge ’ s nephew “ you don ’ t mean that i am sure ” “ i do ” said scrooge “ merry christmas what right have you to be merry what reason have you to be merry you ’ re poor enough ” “ come then ” returned the nephew gaily “ what right have you to be dismal what reason have you to be morose you ’ re rich enough ” scrooge having no better answer ready on the spur of the moment said “ bah ” again and followed it up with “ humbug ” “ don ’ t be cross uncle ” said the nephew “ what else can i be ” returned the uncle “ when i live in such a world of fools as this merry christmas out upon merry christmas what ’ s christmas time to you but a time for paying bills without money a time for finding yourself a year older but not an hour richer a time for balancing your books and having every item in ’ em through a round dozen of months presented dead against you if i could work my will ” said scrooge indignantly “ every idiot who goes about with ‘ merry christmas ’ on his lips should be boiled with his own pudding and buried with a stake of holly through his heart he should ” “ uncle ” pleaded the nephew “ nephew ” returned the uncle sternly “ keep christmas in your own way and let me keep it in mine ” “ keep it ” repeated scrooge ’ s nephew “ but you don ’ t keep it ” “ let me leave it alone then ” said scrooge “ much good may it do you much good it has ever done you ” “ there are many things from which i might have derived good by which i have not profited i dare say ” returned the nephew “ christmas among the rest but i am sure i have always thought of christmas time when it has come roundapart from the veneration due to its sacred name and origin if anything belonging to it can be apart from thatas a good time a kind forgiving charitable pleasant time the only time i know of in the long calendar of the year when men and women seem by one consent to open their shutup hearts freely and to think of people below them as if they really were fellowpassengers to the grave and not another race of creatures bound on other journeys and therefore uncle though it has never put a scrap of gold or silver in my pocket i believe that it has done me good and will do me good and i say god bless it ” the clerk in the tank involuntarily applauded becoming immediately sensible of the impropriety he poked the fire and extinguished the last frail spark for ever “ let me hear another sound from you ” said scrooge “ and you ’ ll keep your christmas by losing your situation you ’ re quite a powerful speaker sir ” he added turning to his nephew “ i wonder you don ’ t go into parliament ” “ don ’ t be angry uncle come dine with us tomorrow ” scrooge said that he would see himyes indeed he did he went the whole length of the expression and said that he would see him in that extremity first “ but why ” cried scrooge ’ s nephew “ why ” “ why did you get married ” said scrooge “ because i fell in love ” “ because you fell in love ” growled scrooge as if that were the only one thing in the world more ridiculous than a merry christmas “ good afternoon ” “ nay uncle but you never came to see me before that happened why give it as a reason for not coming now ” “ good afternoon ” said scrooge “ i want nothing from you i ask nothing of you why can not we be friends ” “ good afternoon ” said scrooge “ i am sorry with all my heart to find you so resolute we have never had any quarrel to which i have been a party but i have made the trial in homage to christmas and i ’ ll keep my christmas humour to the last so a merry christmas uncle ” “ good afternoon ” said scrooge “ and a happy new year ” “ good afternoon ” said scrooge his nephew left the room without an angry word notwithstanding he stopped at the outer door to bestow the greetings of the season on the clerk who cold as he was was warmer than scrooge for he returned them cordially “ there ’ s another fellow ” muttered scrooge who overheard him “ my clerk with fifteen shillings a week and a wife and family talking about a merry christmas i ’ ll retire to bedlam ” this lunatic in letting scrooge ’ s nephew out had let two other people in they were portly gentlemen pleasant to behold and now stood with their hats off in scrooge ’ s office they had books and papers in their hands and bowed to him “ scrooge and marley ’ s i believe ” said one of the gentlemen referring to his list “ have i the pleasure of addressing mr scrooge or mr marley ” “ mr marley has been dead these seven years ” scrooge replied “ he died seven years ago this very night ” “ we have no doubt his liberality is well represented by his surviving partner ” said the gentleman presenting his credentials it certainly was for they had been two kindred spirits at the ominous word “ liberality ” scrooge frowned and shook his head and handed the credentials back “ at this festive season of the year mr scrooge ” said the gentleman taking up a pen “ it is more than usually desirable that we should make some slight provision for the poor and destitute who suffer greatly at the present time many thousands are in want of common necessaries hundreds of thousands are in want of common comforts sir ” “ are there no prisons ” asked scrooge “ plenty of prisons ” said the gentleman laying down the pen again “ and the union workhouses ” demanded scrooge “ are they still in operation ” “ they are still ” returned the gentleman “ i wish i could say they were not ” “ the treadmill and the poor law are in full vigour then ” said scrooge “ both very busy sir ” “ oh i was afraid from what you said at first that something had occurred to stop them in their useful course ” said scrooge “ i ’ m very glad to hear it ” “ under the impression that they scarcely furnish christian cheer of mind or body to the multitude ” returned the gentleman “ a few of us are endeavouring to raise a fund to buy the poor some meat and drink and means of warmth we choose this time because it is a time of all others when want is keenly felt and abundance rejoices what shall i put you down for ” “ nothing ” scrooge replied “ you wish to be anonymous ” “ i wish to be left alone ” said scrooge “ since you ask me what i wish gentlemen that is my answer i don ’ t make merry myself at christmas and i can ’ t afford to make idle people merry i help to support the establishments i have mentionedthey cost enough and those who are badly off must go there ” “ many can ’ t go there and many would rather die ” “ if they would rather die ” said scrooge “ they had better do it and decrease the surplus population besidesexcuse mei don ’ t know that ” “ but you might know it ” observed the gentleman “ it ’ s not my business ” scrooge returned “ it ’ s enough for a man to understand his own business and not to interfere with other people ’ s mine occupies me constantly good afternoon gentlemen ” seeing clearly that it would be useless to pursue their point the gentlemen withdrew scrooge resumed his labours with an improved opinion of himself and in a more facetious temper than was usual with him"

   "it was made plain enough by the dressing of the shops that here too it was christmas time again but it was evening and the streets were lighted up the ghost stopped at a certain warehouse door and asked scrooge if he knew it “ know it ” said scrooge “ was i apprenticed here ” they went in at sight of an old gentleman in a welsh wig sitting behind such a high desk that if he had been two inches taller he must have knocked his head against the ceiling scrooge cried in great excitement “ why it ’ s old fezziwig bless his heart it ’ s fezziwig alive again ” old fezziwig laid down his pen and looked up at the clock which pointed to the hour of seven he rubbed his hands adjusted his capacious waistcoat laughed all over himself from his shoes to his organ of benevolence and called out in a comfortable oily rich fat jovial voice “ yo ho there ebenezer dick ” scrooge ’ s former self now grown a young man came briskly in accompanied by his fellow ’ prentice “ dick wilkins to be sure ” said scrooge to the ghost “ bless me yes there he is he was very much attached to me was dick poor dick dear dear ” “ yo ho my boys ” said fezziwig “ no more work tonight christmas eve dick christmas ebenezer let ’ s have the shutters up ” cried old fezziwig with a sharp clap of his hands “ before a man can say jack robinson ” you wouldn ’ t believe how those two fellows went at it they charged into the street with the shuttersone two threehad ’ em up in their placesfour five sixbarred ’ em and pinned ’ emseven eight nineand came back before you could have got to twelve panting like racehorses “ hilliho ” cried old fezziwig skipping down from the high desk with wonderful agility “ clear away my lads and let ’ s have lots of room here hilliho dick chirrup ebenezer ” clear away there was nothing they wouldn ’ t have cleared away or couldn ’ t have cleared away with old fezziwig looking on it was done in a minute every movable was packed off as if it were dismissed from public life for evermore the floor was swept and watered the lamps were trimmed fuel was heaped upon the fire and the warehouse was as snug and warm and dry and bright a ballroom as you would desire to see upon a winter ’ s night in came a fiddler with a musicbook and went up to the lofty desk and made an orchestra of it and tuned like fifty stomachaches in came mrs fezziwig one vast substantial smile in came the three miss fezziwigs beaming and lovable in came the six young followers whose hearts they broke in came all the young men and women employed in the business in came the housemaid with her cousin the baker in came the cook with her brother ’ s particular friend the milkman in came the boy from over the way who was suspected of not having board enough from his master trying to hide himself behind the girl from next door but one who was proved to have had her ears pulled by her mistress in they all came one after another some shyly some boldly some gracefully some awkwardly some pushing some pulling in they all came anyhow and everyhow away they all went twenty couple at once hands half round and back again the other way down the middle and up again round and round in various stages of affectionate grouping old top couple always turning up in the wrong place new top couple starting off again as soon as they got there all top couples at last and not a bottom one to help them when this result was brought about old fezziwig clapping his hands to stop the dance cried out “ well done ” and the fiddler plunged his hot face into a pot of porter especially provided for that purpose but scorning rest upon his reappearance he instantly began again though there were no dancers yet as if the other fiddler had been carried home exhausted on a shutter and he were a brannew man resolved to beat him out of sight or perish there were more dances and there were forfeits and more dances and there was cake and there was negus and there was a great piece of cold roast and there was a great piece of cold boiled and there were mincepies and plenty of beer but the great effect of the evening came after the roast and boiled when the fiddler ( an artful dog mind the sort of man who knew his business better than you or i could have told it him ) struck up “ sir roger de coverley ” then old fezziwig stood out to dance with mrs fezziwig top couple too with a good stiff piece of work cut out for them three or four and twenty pair of partners people who were not to be trifled with people who would dance and had no notion of walking but if they had been twice as manyah four timesold fezziwig would have been a match for them and so would mrs fezziwig as to her she was worthy to be his partner in every sense of the term if that ’ s not high praise tell me higher and i ’ ll use it a positive light appeared to issue from fezziwig ’ s calves they shone in every part of the dance like moons you couldn ’ t have predicted at any given time what would have become of them next and when old fezziwig and mrs fezziwig had gone all through the dance advance and retire both hands to your partner bow and curtsey corkscrew threadtheneedle and back again to your place fezziwig “ cut ” cut so deftly that he appeared to wink with his legs and came upon his feet again without a stagger when the clock struck eleven this domestic ball broke up mr and mrs fezziwig took their stations one on either side of the door and shaking hands with every person individually as he or she went out wished him or her a merry christmas when everybody had retired but the two ’ prentices they did the same to them and thus the cheerful voices died away and the lads were left to their beds which were under a counter in the backshop during the whole of this time scrooge had acted like a man out of his wits his heart and soul were in the scene and with his former self he corroborated everything remembered everything enjoyed everything and underwent the strangest agitation it was not until now when the bright faces of his former self and dick were turned from them that he remembered the ghost and became conscious that it was looking full upon him while the light upon its head burnt very clear “ a small matter ” said the ghost “ to make these silly folks so full of gratitude ” “ small ” echoed scrooge the spirit signed to him to listen to the two apprentices who were pouring out their hearts in praise of fezziwig and when he had done so said “ why is it not he has spent but a few pounds of your mortal money three or four perhaps is that so much that he deserves this praise ” “ it isn ’ t that ” said scrooge heated by the remark and speaking unconsciously like his former not his latter self “ it isn ’ t that spirit he has the power to render us happy or unhappy to make our service light or burdensome a pleasure or a toil say that his power lies in words and looks in things so slight and insignificant that it is impossible to add and count ’ em up what then the happiness he gives is quite as great as if it cost a fortune ” he felt the spirit ’ s glance and stopped “ what is the matter ” asked the ghost “ nothing particular ” said scrooge “ something i think ” the ghost insisted “ no ” said scrooge “ no i should like to be able to say a word or two to my clerk just now that ’ s all ”"

   "there ” said the spirit laying it upon his heart “ and you shall be upheld in more than this ” as the words were spoken they passed through the wall and stood upon an open country road with fields on either hand the city had entirely vanished not a vestige of it was to be seen the darkness and the mist had vanished with it for it was a clear cold winter day with snow upon the ground “ good heaven ” said scrooge clasping his hands together as he looked about him “ i was bred in this place i was a boy here ” the spirit gazed upon him mildly its gentle touch though it had been light and instantaneous appeared still present to the old man ’ s sense of feeling he was conscious of a thousand odours floating in the air each one connected with a thousand thoughts and hopes and joys and cares long long forgotten “ your lip is trembling ” said the ghost “ and what is that upon your cheek ” scrooge muttered with an unusual catching in his voice that it was a pimple and begged the ghost to lead him where he would “ you recollect the way ” inquired the spirit “ remember it ” cried scrooge with fervour “ i could walk it blindfold ” “ strange to have forgotten it for so many years ” observed the ghost “ let us go on ” they walked along the road scrooge recognising every gate and post and tree until a little markettown appeared in the distance with its bridge its church and winding river some shaggy ponies now were seen trotting towards them with boys upon their backs who called to other boys in country gigs and carts driven by farmers all these boys were in great spirits and shouted to each other until the broad fields were so full of merry music that the crisp air laughed to hear it “ these are but shadows of the things that have been ” said the ghost “ they have no consciousness of us ” the jocund travellers came on and as they came scrooge knew and named them every one why was he rejoiced beyond all bounds to see them why did his cold eye glisten and his heart leap up as they went past why was he filled with gladness when he heard them give each other merry christmas as they parted at crossroads and byeways for their several homes what was merry christmas to scrooge out upon merry christmas what good had it ever done to him “ the school is not quite deserted ” said the ghost “ a solitary child neglected by his friends is left there still ” scrooge said he knew it and he sobbed they left the highroad by a wellremembered lane and soon approached a mansion of dull red brick with a little weathercocksurmounted cupola on the roof and a bell hanging in it it was a large house but one of broken fortunes for the spacious offices were little used their walls were damp and mossy their windows broken and their gates decayed fowls clucked and strutted in the stables and the coachhouses and sheds were overrun with grass nor was it more retentive of its ancient state within for entering the dreary hall and glancing through the open doors of many rooms they found them poorly furnished cold and vast there was an earthy savour in the air a chilly bareness in the place which associated itself somehow with too much getting up by candlelight and not too much to eat they went the ghost and scrooge across the hall to a door at the back of the house it opened before them and disclosed a long bare melancholy room made barer still by lines of plain deal forms and desks at one of these a lonely boy was reading near a feeble fire and scrooge sat down upon a form and wept to see his poor forgotten self as he used to be not a latent echo in the house not a squeak and scuffle from the mice behind the panelling not a drip from the halfthawed waterspout in the dull yard behind not a sigh among the leafless boughs of one despondent poplar not the idle swinging of an empty storehouse door no not a clicking in the fire but fell upon the heart of scrooge with a softening influence and gave a freer passage to his tears the spirit touched him on the arm and pointed to his younger self intent upon his reading suddenly a man in foreign garments wonderfully real and distinct to look at stood outside the window with an axe stuck in his belt and leading by the bridle an ass laden with wood “ why it ’ s ali baba ” scrooge exclaimed in ecstasy “ it ’ s dear old honest ali baba yes yes i know one christmas time when yonder solitary child was left here all alone he did come for the first time just like that poor boy and valentine ” said scrooge “ and his wild brother orson there they go and what ’ s his name who was put down in his drawers asleep at the gate of damascus don ’ t you see him and the sultan ’ s groom turned upside down by the genii there he is upon his head serve him right i ’ m glad of it what business had he to be married to the princess ” to hear scrooge expending all the earnestness of his nature on such subjects in a most extraordinary voice between laughing and crying and to see his heightened and excited face would have been a surprise to his business friends in the city indeed “ there ’ s the parrot ” cried scrooge “ green body and yellow tail with a thing like a lettuce growing out of the top of his head there he is poor robin crusoe he called him when he came home again after sailing round the island ‘ poor robin crusoe where have you been robin crusoe ’ the man thought he was dreaming but he wasn ’ t it was the parrot you know there goes friday running for his life to the little creek halloa hoop halloo ” then with a rapidity of transition very foreign to his usual character he said in pity for his former self “ poor boy ” and cried again “ i wish ” scrooge muttered putting his hand in his pocket and looking about him after drying his eyes with his cuff “ but it ’ s too late now ” “ what is the matter ” asked the spirit “ nothing ” said scrooge “ nothing there was a boy singing a christmas carol at my door last night i should like to have given him something that ’ s all ”"

and not too much to eat they went the ghost and scrooge across the hall to a door at the back of the house it opened before them and disclosed a long bare melancholy room made barer still by lines of plain deal forms and desks at one of these a lonely boy was reading near a feeble fire and scrooge sat down upon a form and wept to see his poor forgotten self as he used to be not a latent echo in the house not a squeak and scuffle from the mice behind the panelling not a drip from the halfthawed waterspout in the dull yard behind not a sigh among the leafless boughs of one despondent poplar not the idle swinging of an empty storehouse door no not a clicking in the fire but fell upon the heart of scrooge with a softening influence and gave a freer passage to his tears the spirit touched him on the arm and pointed to his younger self intent upon his reading suddenly a man in foreign garments wonderfully real and distinct to look at stood outside the window with an axe stuck in his belt and leading by the bridle an ass laden with wood “ why it ’ s ali baba ” scrooge exclaimed in ecstasy “ it ’ s dear old honest ali baba yes yes i know one christmas time when yonder solitary child was left here all alone he did come for the first time just like that poor boy and valentine ” said scrooge “ and his wild brother orson there they go and what ’ s his name who was put down in his drawers asleep at the gate of damascus don ’ t you see him and the sultan ’ s groom turned upside down by the genii there he is upon his head serve him right i ’ m glad of it what business had he to be married to the princess ” to hear scrooge expending all the earnestness of his nature on such subjects in a most extraordinary voice between laughing and crying and to see his heightened and excited face would have been a surprise to his business friends in the city indeed “ there ’ s the parrot ” cried scrooge “ green body and yellow tail with a thing like a lettuce growing out of the top of his head there he is poor robin crusoe he called him when he came home again after sailing round the island ‘ poor robin crusoe where have you been robin crusoe ’ the man thought he was dreaming but he wasn ’ t it was the parrot you know there goes friday running for his life to the little creek halloa hoop halloo ” then with a rapidity of transition very foreign to his usual character he said in pity for his former self “ poor boy ” and cried again “ i wish ” scrooge muttered putting his hand in his pocket and looking about him after drying his eyes with his cuff “ but it ’ s too late now ” “ what is the matter ” asked the spirit “ nothing ” said scrooge “ nothing there was a boy singing a christmas carol at my door last night i should like to have given him something that ’ s all ”"

   "for the people who were shovelling away on the housetops were jovial and full of glee calling out to one another from the parapets and now and then exchanging a facetious snowballbetternatured missile far than many a wordy jestlaughing heartily if it went right and not less heartily if it went wrong the poulterers ’ shops were still half open and the fruiterers ’ were radiant in their glory there were great round potbellied baskets of chestnuts shaped like the waistcoats of jolly old gentlemen lolling at the doors and tumbling out into the street in their apoplectic opulence there were ruddy brownfaced broadgirthed spanish onions shining in the fatness of their growth like spanish friars and winking from their shelves in wanton slyness at the girls as they went by and glanced demurely at the hungup mistletoe there were pears and apples clustered high in blooming pyramids there were bunches of grapes made in the shopkeepers ’ benevolence to dangle from conspicuous hooks that people ’ s mouths might water gratis as they passed there were piles of filberts mossy and brown recalling in their fragrance ancient walks among the woods and pleasant shufflings ankle deep through withered leaves there were norfolk biffins squat and swarthy setting off the yellow of the oranges and lemons and in the great compactness of their juicy persons urgently entreating and beseeching to be carried home in paper bags and eaten after dinner the very gold and silver fish set forth among these choice fruits in a bowl though members of a dull and stagnantblooded race appeared to know that there was something going on and to a fish went gasping round and round their little world in slow and passionless excitement the grocers ’ oh the grocers ’ nearly closed with perhaps two shutters down or one but through those gaps such glimpses it was not alone that the scales descending on the counter made a merry sound or that the twine and roller parted company so briskly or that the canisters were rattled up and down like juggling tricks or even that the blended scents of tea and coffee were so grateful to the nose or even that the raisins were so plentiful and rare the almonds so extremely white the sticks of cinnamon so long and straight the other spices so delicious the candied fruits so caked and spotted with molten sugar as to make the coldest lookerson feel faint and subsequently bilious nor was it that the figs were moist and pulpy or that the french plums blushed in modest tartness from their highlydecorated boxes or that everything was good to eat and in its christmas dress but the customers were all so hurried and so eager in the hopeful promise of the day that they tumbled up against each other at the door crashing their wicker baskets wildly and left their purchases upon the counter and came running back to fetch them and committed hundreds of the like mistakes in the best humour possible while the grocer and his people were so frank and fresh that the polished hearts with which they fastened their aprons behind might have been their own worn outside for general inspection and for christmas daws to peck at if they chose but soon the steeples called good people all to church and chapel and away they came flocking through the streets in their best clothes and with their gayest faces and at the same time there emerged from scores of byestreets lanes and nameless turnings innumerable people carrying their dinners to the bakers ’ shops the sight of these poor revellers appeared to interest the spirit very much for he stood with scrooge beside him in a baker ’ s doorway and taking off the covers as their bearers passed sprinkled incense on their dinners from his torch and it was a very uncommon kind of torch for once or twice when there were angry words between some dinnercarriers who had jostled each other he shed a few drops of water on them from it and their good humour was restored directly for they said it was a shame to quarrel upon christmas day and so it was god love it so it was in time the bells ceased and the bakers were shut up and yet there was a genial shadowing forth of all these dinners and the progress of their cooking in the thawed blotch of wet above each baker ’ s oven where the pavement smoked as if its stones were cooking too “ is there a peculiar flavour in what you sprinkle from your torch ” asked scrooge “ there is my own ” “ would it apply to any kind of dinner on this day ” asked scrooge “ to any kindly given to a poor one most ” “ why to a poor one most ” asked scrooge “ because it needs it most ” “ spirit ” said scrooge after a moment ’ s thought “ i wonder you of all the beings in the many worlds about us should desire to cramp these people ’ s opportunities of innocent enjoyment ” “ i ” cried the spirit “ you would deprive them of their means of dining every seventh day often the only day on which they can be said to dine at all ” said scrooge “ wouldn ’ t you ” “ i ” cried the spirit “ you seek to close these places on the seventh day ” said scrooge “ and it comes to the same thing ” “ i seek ” exclaimed the spirit “ forgive me if i am wrong it has been done in your name or at least in that of your family ” said scrooge “ there are some upon this earth of yours ” returned the spirit “ who lay claim to know us and who do their deeds of passion pride illwill hatred envy bigotry and selfishness in our name who are as strange to us and all our kith and kin as if they had never lived remember that and charge their doings on themselves not us"
