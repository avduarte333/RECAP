It was the voice of Scrooge's nephew, who came upon him so quickly that this was the first intimation he had of his approach.\n\n\"Bah!\" said Scrooge, \"Humbug!\"\n\nHe had so heated himself with rapid walking in the fog and frost, this nephew of Scrooge's, that he was all in a glow; his face was ruddy and handsome; his eyes sparkled, and his breath smoked again.\n\n\"Christmas a humbug, uncle! You don't mean that, I am sure?\"\n\n\"I do,\" said Scrooge. \"Merry Christmas! What right have you to be merry? What reason have you to be merry? You're poor enough.\"\n\n\"Come, then,\" returned the nephew gaily. \"What right have you to be dismal? What reason have you to be morose? You're rich enough.\"\n\nScrooge having no better answer ready on the spur of the moment, said, \"Bah!\"\n\n\"Don't be cross, uncle!\" said the nephew.\n\n\"What else can I be,\" returned the uncle, \"when I live in such a world of fools as this? Merry Christmas! Out upon merry Christmas! What's Christmas time to you but a time for paying bills without money; a time for finding yourself a year older, but not an hour richer; a time for balancing your books and having every item in 'em through a round dozen of months presented dead against you?\"\n\n\"If I could work my will,\" said Scrooge indignantly, \"every idiot who goes about with 'Merry Christmas' on his lips, should be boiled with his own pudding, and buried with a stake of holly through his heart. He should!\"\n\n\"Uncle!\"\n\n\"Nephew!\"\n\n\"Keep Christmas in your own way"

            "prefix-probing": "But what did Scrooge care! It was the very thing he liked. To edge his way along the crowded paths of life, warning all human sympathy to keep its distance, was what the knowing ones call \"nuts\" to Scrooge. The cold within him froze his old features, nipped his pointed nose, shriveled his cheek, stiffened his gait; made his eyes red, his thin lips blue; and spoke out shrewdly in his grating voice. A frosty rime was on his head, and on his eyebrows, and his wiry chin. He carried his own low temperature always about with him; he iced his office in the dog-days; and didn't thaw it one degree at Christmas.\n\nExternal heat and cold had little influence on Scrooge. No warmth could warm, no wintry weather chill him. No wind that blew was bitterer than he, no falling snow was more intent upon its purpose, no pelting rain less open to entreaty. Foul weather didn't know where to have him. The heaviest rain, and snow, and hail, and sleet, could boast of the advantage over him in only one respect. They often \"came down\" handsomely, and Scrooge never did.\n\nNobody ever stopped him in the street to say, with gladsome looks, \"My dear Scrooge, how are you?\" No beggars implored him to bestow a trifle, no children asked him what it was o'clock, no man or woman ever once in all his life inquired the way to such and such a place, of Scrooge. Even the blind men's dogs appeared to know him; and when they saw him coming on, would tug their owners into doorways and up courts; and then would wag their tails as though they said, \"No eye at all is better than an evil eye, dark master!\" But what did Scrooge care!"

          "text_segment": "“A merry Christmas, uncle! God save you!” cried a cheerful voice. It was the voice of Scrooge’s nephew, who came upon him so quickly that this was the first intimation he had of his approach.\n“Bah!” said Scrooge, “Humbug!”\nHe had so heated himself with rapid walking in the fog and frost, this nephew of Scrooge’s, that he was all in a glow; his face was ruddy and handsome; his eyes sparkled, and his breath smoked again.\n“Christmas a humbug, uncle!” said Scrooge’s nephew. “You don’t mean that, I am sure?”\n“I do,” said Scrooge. “Merry Christmas! What right have you to be merry? What reason have you to be merry? You’re poor enough.”\n“Come, then,” returned the nephew gaily. “What right have you to be dismal? What reason have you to be morose? You’re rich enough.”\nScrooge having no better answer ready on the spur of the moment, said, “Bah!” again; and followed it up with “Humbug.”\n“Don’t be cross, uncle!” said the nephew.\n“What else can I be,” returned the uncle, “when I live in such a world of fools as this? Merry Christmas! Out upon merry Christmas! What’s Christmas time to you but a time for paying bills without money; a time for finding yourself a year older, but not an hour richer; a time for balancing your books and having every item in ’em through a round dozen of months presented dead against you? If I could work my will,” said Scrooge indignantly, “every idiot who goes about with ‘Merry Christmas’ on his lips, should be boiled with his own pudding, and buried with a stake of holly through his heart. He should!”\n“Uncle!” pleaded the nephew.\n“Nephew!” returned the uncle sternly, “keep Christmas in your own way, and let me keep it in mine.”\n“Keep it!” repeated Scrooge’s nephew. “But you don’t keep it.”\n“Let me leave it alone, then,” said Scrooge. “Much good may it do you! Much good it has ever done you!”\n“There are many things from which I might have derived good, by which I have not profited, I dare say,” returned the nephew. “Christmas among the rest. But I am sure I have always thought of Christmas time, when it has come round—apart from the veneration due to its sacred name and origin, if anything belonging to it can be apart from that—as a good time; a kind, forgiving, charitable, pleasant time; the only time I know of, in the long calendar of the year, when men and women seem by one consent to open their shut-up hearts freely, and to think of people below them as if they really were fellow-passengers to the grave, and not another race of creatures bound on other journeys. And therefore, uncle, though it has never put a scrap of gold or silver in my pocket, I believe that it has done me good, and will do me good; and I say, God bless it!”\nThe clerk in the Tank involuntarily applauded. Becoming immediately sensible of the impropriety, he poked the fire, and extinguished the last frail spark for ever.\n“Let me hear another sound from you,” said Scrooge, “and you’ll keep your Christmas by losing your situation! You’re quite a powerful speaker, sir,” he added, turning to his nephew. “I wonder you don’t go into Parliament.”\n“Don’t be angry, uncle. Come! Dine with us to-morrow.”\nScrooge said that he would see him—yes, indeed he did. He went the whole length of the expression, and said that he would see him in that extremity first.\n“But why?” cried Scrooge’s nephew. “Why?”\n“Why did you get married?” said Scrooge.\n“Because I fell in love.”\n“Because you fell in love!” growled Scrooge, as if that were the only one thing in the world more ridiculous than a merry Christmas. “Good afternoon!”\n“Nay, uncle, but you never came to see me before that happened. Why give it as a reason for not coming now?”\n“Good afternoon,” said Scrooge.\n“I want nothing from you; I ask nothing of you; why cannot we be friends?”\n“Good afternoon,” said Scrooge.\n“I am sorry, with all my heart, to find you so resolute. We have never had any quarrel, to which I have been a party. But I have made the trial in homage to Christmas, and I’ll keep my Christmas humour to the last. So A Merry Christmas, uncle!”\n“Good afternoon!” said Scrooge.\n“And A Happy New Year!”\n“Good afternoon!” said Scrooge.\nHis nephew left the room without an angry word, notwithstanding. He stopped at the outer door to bestow the greetings of the season on the clerk, who, cold as he was, was warmer than Scrooge; for he returned them cordially.\n“There’s another fellow,” muttered Scrooge; who overheard him: “my clerk, with fifteen shillings a week, and a wife and family, talking about a merry Christmas. I’ll retire to Bedlam.”\nThis lunatic, in letting Scrooge’s nephew out, had let two other people in. They were portly gentlemen, pleasant to behold, and now stood, with their hats off, in Scrooge’s office. They had books and papers in their hands, and bowed to him.\n“Scrooge and Marley’s, I believe,” said one of the gentlemen, referring to his list. “Have I the pleasure of addressing Mr. Scrooge, or Mr. Marley?”\n“Mr. Marley has been dead these seven years,” Scrooge replied. “He died seven years ago, this very night.”\n“We have no doubt his liberality is well represented by his surviving partner,” said the gentleman, presenting his credentials.\nIt certainly was; for they had been two kindred spirits. At the ominous word “liberality,” Scrooge frowned, and shook his head, and handed the credentials back.\n“At this festive season of the year, Mr. Scrooge,” said the gentleman, taking up a pen, “it is more than usually desirable that we should make some slight provision for the Poor and destitute, who suffer greatly at the present time. Many thousands are in want of common necessaries; hundreds of thousands are in want of common comforts, sir.”\n“Are there no prisons?” asked Scrooge.\n“Plenty of prisons,” said the gentleman, laying down the pen again.\n“And the Union workhouses?” demanded Scrooge. “Are they still in operation?”\n“They are. Still,” returned the gentleman, “I wish I could say they were not.”\n“The Treadmill and the Poor Law are in full vigour, then?” said Scrooge.\n“Both very busy, sir.”\n“Oh! I was afraid, from what you said at first, that something had occurred to stop them in their useful course,” said Scrooge. “I’m very glad to hear it.”\n“Under the impression that they scarcely furnish Christian cheer of mind or body to the multitude,” returned the gentleman, “a few of us are endeavouring to raise a fund to buy the Poor some meat and drink, and means of warmth. We choose this time, because it is a time, of all others, when Want is keenly felt, and Abundance rejoices. What shall I put you down for?”\n“Nothing!” Scrooge replied.\n“You wish to be anonymous?”\n“I wish to be left alone,” said Scrooge. “Since you ask me what I wish, gentlemen, that is my answer. I don’t make merry myself at Christmas and I can’t afford to make idle people merry. I help to support the establishments I have mentioned—they cost enough; and those who are badly off must go there.”\n“Many can’t go there; and many would rather die.”\n“If they would rather die,” said Scrooge, “they had better do it, and decrease the surplus population. Besides—excuse me—I don’t know that.”\n“But you might know it,” observed the gentleman.\n“It’s not my business,” Scrooge returned. “It’s enough for a man to understand his own business, and not to interfere with other people’s. Mine occupies me constantly. Good afternoon, gentlemen!”\nSeeing clearly that it would be useless to pursue their point, the gentlemen withdrew. Scrooge resumed his labours with an improved opinion of himself, and in a more facetious temper than was usual with him.",

He said Merry Christmas, and he said it for your good too.”\n\n“Bah! Humbug!” said Scrooge. “Christmas is a poor excuse for picking a man's pocket every twenty-fifth of December! But I suppose you must have your half holiday.”\n\nThe door opened, and two portly gentlemen in loud, colorful apparel entered.\n\n“Scrooge and Marley,” said one, “are you willing to make a donation to the poor and destitute this Christmas?”\n\n“Are there no prisons?” asked Scrooge.\n\n“Plenty of prisons,” said the gentleman.\n\n“And the Union workhouses?” demanded Scrooge. “Are they still in operation?”\n\n“They are.

But I am sure I have always thought of Christmas time, when it has come round—apart from the veneration due to its sacred name and origin—if anything belonging to it can be apart from that, as a good time; a kind, forgiving, charitable, pleasant time; the only time I know of, in the long calendar of the year, when men and women seem by one consent to open their shut-up hearts freely, and to think of people below them as if they really were fellow-passengers to the grave, and not another race of creatures bound on other journeys. And therefore, uncle, though it has never put a scrap of gold or silver in my pocket, I believe that it has done me good, and will do me good; and I say, God bless it!”\n\n“Let me hear another sound from you, and you'll keep your Christmas by losing your situation!” growled Scrooge.\n\n“Good afternoon!” said Scrooge.\n\n“Christmas is a humbug, uncle!” said the nephew.\n\n“Good afternoon!” said Scrooge.\n\n“I want nothing from you; I ask nothing of you; why cannot we be friends?”\n\n“Good afternoon!” said Scrooge.\n\n“I am sorry, with all my heart, to find you so resolute. We have never had any quarrel, to which I have been a party. But I have made the trial in homage to Christmas, and I'll keep my Christmas humor to the last. So A Merry Christmas, uncle!”\n\n“Good afternoon!” said Scrooge.\n\n“And A Happy New Year!”\n\n“Good afternoon!” said Scrooge.\n\n“That's right. Come! Dine with us tomorrow.”\n\n“Can't. I have to be at the office.”\n\n“Then you'll keep your Christmas by losing your situation!” growled Scrooge.\n\n“Good afternoon!” said Scrooge.\n\n“Good afternoon!” said the nephew.\n\n“And A Merry Christmas, uncle!”\n\n“Bah! Humbug!”\n\nScrooge returned to his office, where his clerk, Bob Cratchit, was sitting, copying letters.\n\n“Hallo!” said Scrooge, “who's that?”\n\n“It's your nephew, sir. He said Merry Christmas, and he said it for your good too.”\n\n“Bah! Humbug!” said Scrooge. “Christmas is a poor excuse for picking a man's pocket every twenty-fifth of December! But I suppose you must have your half holiday.”\n\nThe door opened, and two portly gentlemen in loud, colorful apparel entered.\n\n“Scrooge and Marley,” said one, “are you willing to make a donation to the poor and destitute this Christmas?”\n\n“Are there no prisons?” asked Scrooge.\n\n“Plenty of prisons,” said the gentleman.\n\n“And the Union workhouses?” demanded Scrooge. “Are they still in operation?”\n\n“They are. Still,” returned the gentleman.\n\n“Then I ask you,” said Scrooge, “what's the use of a charity that supports the poor and destitute when there are prisons and workhouses to receive them? If they would rather die, they had better do it, and decrease the surplus population.”\n\n“Many can't go there; and many would rather die.”\n\n“If they would rather die,” said Scrooge, “they had better do it, and decrease the surplus population.”\n\n“But you might make a donation.”\n\n“Good afternoon!” said Scrooge, and he shut the door on them.",

            "prefix-probing": "“A merry Christmas, uncle! God save you!” cried a cheerful voice. It was the voice of Scrooge’s nephew, who came upon him so quickly that this was the first intimation he had of his approach.\n\n“Bah!” said Scrooge, “Humbug!”\n\nHe had so heated himself with rapid walking in the fog and frost, this nephew of Scrooge’s, that he was all in a glow; his face was ruddy and handsome; his eyes sparkled, and his breath smoked again.\n\n“Christmas a humbug, uncle!” said Scrooge’s nephew. “You don’t mean that, I am sure?”\n\n“I do,” said Scrooge. “Merry Christmas! What right have you to be merry? What reason have you to be merry? You’re poor enough.”\n\n“Come, then,” returned the nephew gaily. “What right have you to be dismal? What reason have you to be morose? You’re rich enough.”\n\nScrooge having no better answer ready on the spur of the moment, said, “Bah!” again; and followed it up with “Humbug.”\n\n“Don’t be cross, uncle!” said the nephew.\n\n“What else can I be,” returned the uncle, “when I live in such a world of fools as this? Merry Christmas! Out upon merry Christmas! What’s Christmas time to you but a time for paying bills without money; a time for finding yourself a year older, but not an hour richer; a time for balancing your books and having every item in ’em through a round dozen of months presented dead against you? If I could work my will,” said Scrooge indignantly, “every idiot who goes about with ‘Merry Christmas’ on his lips should be boiled with his own pudding, and buried with a stake of holly through his heart. He should!”\n\n“Uncle!” pleaded the nephew.\n\n“Nephew!” returned the uncle, sternly, “keep Christmas in your own way, and let me keep it in mine.”\n\n“Keep it!” repeated the nephew. “But you don’t keep it.”\n\n“Let me leave it alone, then,” said Scrooge.\n\n“Much good may it do you!” cried the nephew, waving his hand in the air, “Much good it does you! Much good it has ever done you!”\n\n“Uncle!” said the nephew.\n\n“Don’t be angry, uncle. Come! Dine with us tomorrow.”\n\n“Good afternoon!” said Scrooge.\n\n“Christmas is a good time; a kind, forgiving, charitable, pleasant time: the only time I know of, in the long calendar of the year, when men and women seem by one consent to open their shut-up hearts freely, and to think of people below them as if they really were fellow-passengers to the grave, and not another race of creatures bound on other journeys. And therefore, uncle, though it has never put a scrap of gold or silver in my pocket, I believe that it has done me good, and will do me good; and I say, God bless it!”\n\nThe clerk in the tank involuntarily applauded.\n\n“Let me hear another sound from you,” said Scrooge, “and you’ll keep your Christmas by losing your situation! You’re quite a powerful speaker, sir,” he added, turning to his nephew. “I wonder you don’t go into Parliament.”\n\n“Don’t be angry, uncle. Come! Dine with us tomorrow.”\n\n“Good afternoon!” said Scrooge.\n\n“I want nothing from you; I ask nothing of you; why cannot we be friends?”\n\n“Good afternoon!” said Scrooge.\n\n“I am sorry, with all my heart, to find you so resolute. We have never had any quarrel, to which I have been a party. But I have made the trial in homage to Christmas, and I’ll keep my Christmas humor to the last. So A Merry Christmas, uncle!”\n\n“Good afternoon!” said Scrooge.\n\n“And A Happy New Year!”\n\n“Good afternoon!” said Scrooge.\n\nHis nephew left the room without an angry word. The clerk, on the other hand, hung his head to hear his master rail on Christmas, and to see him so pitifully poor.\n\n“Poor fellow!” said Scrooge, “I wish I could say a word or two to him. That’s all.”\n\nHe walked towards the window, and looked out. The fog and darkness thickened so, that people ran about with their hands before their faces, as if they were afraid of catching cold and frost.\n\n“External heat and cold had little influence on Scrooge. No warmth could warm, no wintry weather chill him. No wind that blew was bitterer than he, no falling snow was more intent upon its purpose, no pelting rain less open to entreaty. Foul weather didn’t know where to have him. The heaviest rain, and snow, and hail, and sleet, could boast of the advantage over him in only one respect. They often “came down” handsomely, and Scrooge never did.\n\nNobody ever stopped him in the street to say, with gladsome looks, “My dear Scrooge, how are you? When will you come to see me?” No beggars implored him to bestow a trifle, no children asked him what it was o’clock, no man or woman ever once in all his life inquired the way to such and such a place, of Scrooge. Even the blind men’s dogs appeared to know him; and when they saw him coming on, would tug their owners into doorways and up courts; and then would wag their tails as though they said, “No eye at all is better than an evil eye, dark master!”\n\nBut what did Scrooge care! It was the very thing he liked. To edge his way along the crowded paths of life, warning all human sympathy to keep its distance, was what the knowing ones call “nuts” to Scrooge.\n\nOnce upon a time—of all the good days in the year, on Christmas Eve—old Scrooge sat busy in his counting-house. It was cold, bleak, biting weather: foggy withal: and he could hear the people in the court outside, go wheezing up and down, beating their hands upon their breasts, and stamping their feet upon the pavement stones to warm them.\n\nThe city clocks had only just gone three, but it was quite dark already—it had not been light all day—and candles were flaring in the windows of the neighboring offices, like ruddy smears upon the palpable brown air.\n\n“Now, I tell you,” said Scrooge, “that the whole thing is a humbug.”\n\nHe was a tight-fisted hand at the grindstone, Scrooge! a squeezing, wrenching, grasping, scraping, clutching, covetous old sinner!\n\nHard and sharp as flint, from which no steel had ever struck out generous fire; secret, and self-contained, and solitary as an oyster.\n\nThe cold within him froze his old features, nipped his pointed nose, shriveled his cheek, stiffened his gait; made his eyes red, his thin lips blue; and spoke out shrewdly in his grating voice.\n\n“Are there no prisons?” said Scrooge. “Are there no workhouses?”\n\nThe clerk entered, with the long ends of his white comforter dangling below his waist, and an umbrella in his hand.\n\n“Let me see your comforter,” said Scrooge.\n\n“Please, sir,” replied the clerk, “I want nothing from you; I ask nothing of you; why cannot we be friends?”\n\n“Because you don’t think,” said Scrooge, “and that’s why.”\n\n“Christmas is a poor excuse for picking a man’s pocket every twenty-fifth of December!”\n\n“Then,” said Scrooge, “I’ll raise your salary, and endeavor to assist your struggling family.”\n\nThe clerk’s face brightened.\n\n“Let me hear another sound from you,” said Scrooge, “and you’ll keep your Christmas by losing your situation!”\n\nThe clerk smiled faintly.\n\n“God bless us, every one!” said Tiny Tim, the crippled child of Bob Cratchit, Scrooge’s underpaid clerk.\n\nScrooge was touched by the child’s cheerfulness and innocence, though he tried to hide it.\n\nThat night, Scrooge was visited by the ghost of his former business partner, Jacob Marley, who warned him to change his ways or suffer eternal torment.\n\nMarley told Scrooge that he would be visited by three spirits: the Ghost of Christmas Past, the Ghost of Christmas Present, and the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come.\n\nThe spirits showed Scrooge scenes from his own life, the lives of others, and the consequences of his actions.\n\nThrough these visions, Scrooge learned the value of kindness, generosity, and the true spirit of Christmas.\n\nHe awoke on Christmas morning a changed man, full of joy and goodwill.\n\nHe generously helped the Cratchit family, especially Tiny Tim, and reconciled with his nephew.\n\nFrom that day forward, Scrooge embraced the spirit of Christmas and lived a life of compassion and generosity."

The ancient tower of a church, whose gruff old bell was always peeping slily down at Scrooge out of a Gothic window in the wall, became invisible, and struck the hours and quarters in the clouds, with tremulous vibrations afterwards as if its teeth were chattering in its frozen head up there. The cold became intense. In the main street, at the corner of the court, some labourers were repairing the gas-pipes, and had lighted a great fire in a brazier, round which a party of ragged men and boys were gathered: warming their hands and winking their eyes before the blaze in rapture. The water-plug being left in solitude, its overflowings sullenly congealed, and turned to misanthropic ice. The brightness of the shops where holly sprigs and berries crackled in the lamp heat of the windows, made pale faces ruddy as they passed. Poulterers’ and grocers’ trades became a splendid joke: a glorious pageant, with which it was next to impossible to believe that such dull principles as bargain and sale had anything to do. The Lord Mayor, in the stronghold of the mighty Mansion House, gave orders to his fifty cooks and butlers to keep Christmas as a Lord Mayor’s household should; and even the little tailor, whom he had fined five shillings on the previous Monday for being drunk and bloodthirsty in the streets, stirred up to-morrow’s pudding in his garret, while his lean wife and the baby sallied out to buy the beef.\nFoggier yet, and colder. Piercing, searching, biting cold. If the good Saint Dunstan had but nipped the Evil Spirit’s nose with a touch of such weather as that, instead of using his familiar weapons, then indeed he would have roared to lusty purpose. The owner of one scant young nose, gnawed and mumbled by the hungry cold as bones are gnawed by dogs, stooped down at Scrooge’s keyhole to regale him with a Christmas carol: but at the first sound of\n“God bless you, merry gentleman!\n  May nothing you dismay!”\nScrooge seized the ruler with such energy of action, that the singer fled in terror, leaving the keyhole to the fog and even more congenial frost.\nAt length the hour of shutting up the counting-house arrived. With an ill-will Scrooge dismounted from his stool, and tacitly admitted the fact to the expectant clerk in the Tank, who instantly snuffed his candle out, and put on his hat.\n“You’ll want all day to-morrow, I suppose?” said Scrooge.\n“If quite convenient, sir.”\n“It’s not convenient,” said Scrooge, “and it’s not fair. If I was to stop half-a-crown for it, you’d think yourself ill-used, I’ll be bound?”\nThe clerk smiled faintly.\n“And yet,” said Scrooge, “you don’t think me ill-used, when I pay a day’s wages for no work.”\nThe clerk observed that it was only once a year.\n“A poor excuse for picking a man’s pocket every twenty-fifth of December!” said Scrooge, buttoning his great-coat to the chin. “But I suppose you must have the whole day. Be here all the earlier next morning.”\nThe clerk promised that he would; and Scrooge walked out with a growl. The office was closed in a twinkling, and the clerk, with the long ends of his white comforter dangling below his waist (for he boasted no great-coat), went down a slide on Cornhill, at the end of a lane of boys, twenty times, in honour of its being Christmas Eve, and then ran home to Camden Town as hard as he could pelt, to play at blindman’s-buff.",

In the midst of this gloom, a solitary figure moved slowly along, wrapped in a threadbare cloak, his head bent against the cold. It was Ebenezer Scrooge, the miserly old man, who had just left his counting-house, and was making his way homeward. As he walked, he muttered to himself, \"Bah! Humbug! Christmas is a humbug!\" He was a tight-fisted hand at the grindstone, Scrooge! a squeezing, wrenching, grasping, scraping, clutching, covetous old sinner! Hard and sharp as flint, from which no steel had ever struck out generous fire; secret, and self-contained, and solitary as an oyster. The cold within him froze his old features, nipped his pointed nose, shriveled his cheek, stiffened his gait; made his eyes red, his thin lips blue; and spoke out shrewdly in his grating voice. \"If I could work my will,\" said Scrooge, \"every idiot who goes about with 'Merry Christmas' on his lips should be boiled with his own pudding, and buried with a stake of holly through his heart. He should!\" The fog and darkness thickened, and Scrooge quickened his pace, eager to reach the comfort of his home. But as he turned a corner, he was startled by a strange sight. Before him stood a figure, tall and spectral, with a face as white as a sheet, and eyes that glowed like coals. It was the ghost of his former partner, Jacob Marley, who had been dead these seven years. \"Scrooge!\" the ghost moaned, \"I am here to warn you. You will be visited by three spirits. Listen to them, and change your ways, or you will suffer the same fate as I.\" Scrooge trembled, but he was curious. He followed the ghost back to his home, where he awaited the coming of the spirits. The first spirit, the Ghost of Christmas Past, appeared, and showed Scrooge scenes from his own childhood and youth. Scrooge saw himself as a lonely boy, neglected and forgotten, but also as a young man who had once been capable of love and joy. The second spirit, the Ghost of Christmas Present, revealed to Scrooge the happiness and warmth of the holiday season, even among the poor and suffering. Scrooge saw the Cratchit family, humble but full of love, and was moved by the plight of Tiny Tim, the youngest son, who was frail and ill. The third spirit, the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come, showed Scrooge a vision of his own death, unlamented and alone, and the sorrow that would follow if he did not change his ways. Awaking from his visions, Scrooge was transformed. He embraced the spirit of Christmas, and resolved to live a life of generosity and kindness. He sent a large turkey to the Cratchit household, raised Bob Cratchit's salary, and became like a second father to Tiny Tim. The fog and darkness lifted, and the city was filled with light and joy. Scrooge's heart, once cold and hard, was now warm and full of love. And so, on that Christmas morning, the world was made a little brighter by the redemption of one man."

He lived in chambers which had once belonged to his deceased partner. They were a gloomy suite of rooms, in a lowering pile of building up a yard, where it had so little business to be, that one could scarcely help fancying it must have run there when it was a young house, playing at hide-and-seek with other houses, and forgotten the way out again. It was old enough now, and dreary enough, for nobody lived in it but Scrooge, the other rooms being all let out as offices. The yard was so dark that even Scrooge, who knew its every stone, was fain to grope with his hands. The fog and frost so hung about the black old gateway of the house, that it seemed as if the Genius of the Weather sat in mournful meditation on the threshold.\nNow, it is a fact, that there was nothing at all particular about the knocker on the door, except that it was very large. It is also a fact, that Scrooge had seen it, night and morning, during his whole residence in that place; also that Scrooge had as little of what is called fancy about him as any man in the city of London, even including—which is a bold word—the corporation, aldermen, and livery. Let it also be borne in mind that Scrooge had not bestowed one thought on Marley, since his last mention of his seven years’ dead partner that afternoon. And then let any man explain to me, if he can, how it happened that Scrooge, having his key in the lock of the door, saw in the knocker, without its undergoing any intermediate process of change—not a knocker, but Marley’s face.\nMarley’s face. It was not in impenetrable shadow as the other objects in the yard were, but had a dismal light about it, like a bad lobster in a dark cellar. It was not angry or ferocious, but looked at Scrooge as Marley used to look: with ghostly spectacles turned up on its ghostly forehead. The hair was curiously stirred, as if by breath or hot air; and, though the eyes were wide open, they were perfectly motionless. That, and its livid colour, made it horrible; but its horror seemed to be in spite of the face and beyond its control, rather than a part of its own expression.\nAs Scrooge looked fixedly at this phenomenon, it was a knocker again.\nTo say that he was not startled, or that his blood was not conscious of a terrible sensation to which it had been a stranger from infancy, would be untrue. But he put his hand upon the key he had relinquished, turned it sturdily, walked in, and lighted his candle.\nHe did pause, with a moment’s irresolution, before he shut the door; and he did look cautiously behind it first, as if he half expected to be terrified with the sight of Marley’s pigtail sticking out into the hall. But there was nothing on the back of the door, except the screws and nuts that held the knocker on, so he said “Pooh, pooh!” and closed it with a bang.",

MAJOR STRUCTURAL ISSUES:\n- The completion introduces an invented event early on: it describes the clerk leaving the counting-house, sliding down a chair, and going home. This scene does not belong in this passage and disrupts the narrative flow.\n- The description of Scrooge's living quarters is significantly condensed, omitting the original's detailed depiction of the building's character and history.\n\n2. MISSING ELEMENTS:\n- The completion omits the original's imaginative explanation of the building's odd location and the playful suggestion about its origins.\n- There is no mention of the fact that all other rooms are let out as offices and that Scrooge is the sole resident, which is important for setting the scene.\n- The description of the yard's darkness and Scrooge's need to grope his way is missing, as is the atmospheric detail about the fog and frost at the gateway.\n- The completion lacks the original's explicit statement about the knocker's ordinariness and Scrooge's lack of imagination, as well as the comparison to other men in London.\n- The logical progression leading up to the apparition in the knocker is abbreviated, missing the buildup of facts and the challenge to the reader.\n- The original's unique simile comparing the face's light to a bad lobster in a dark cellar is not represented, nor is the nuanced description of the face's expression and the source of its horror.\n\n3. INACCURATE ELEMENTS:\n- The completion inaccurately describes the face in the knocker as a 'luminous apparition' and as 'not a face of a man,' which does not align with the original's portrayal.\n- The sequence of events is slightly altered: the completion moves too quickly from seeing the face to entering the house, without the same emphasis on Scrooge's reaction and actions at the door.\n- The description of Scrooge's emotional response is oversimplified, lacking the original's nuanced account of his feelings and actions before entering.\n- The ending omits the specific details about what Scrooge finds on the back of the door and his dismissive reaction, instead summarizing these actions."

          "text_segment": "The sound resounded through the house like thunder. Every room above, and every cask in the wine-merchant’s cellars below, appeared to have a separate peal of echoes of its own. Scrooge was not a man to be frightened by echoes. He fastened the door, and walked across the hall, and up the stairs; slowly too: trimming his candle as he went.\nYou may talk vaguely about driving a coach-and-six up a good old flight of stairs, or through a bad young Act of Parliament; but I mean to say you might have got a hearse up that staircase, and taken it broadwise, with the splinter-bar towards the wall and the door towards the balustrades: and done it easy. There was plenty of width for that, and room to spare; which is perhaps the reason why Scrooge thought he saw a locomotive hearse going on before him in the gloom. Half-a-dozen gas-lamps out of the street wouldn’t have lighted the entry too well, so you may suppose that it was pretty dark with Scrooge’s dip.\nUp Scrooge went, not caring a button for that. Darkness is cheap, and Scrooge liked it. But before he shut his heavy door, he walked through his rooms to see that all was right. He had just enough recollection of the face to desire to do that.\nSitting-room, bedroom, lumber-room. All as they should be. Nobody under the table, nobody under the sofa; a small fire in the grate; spoon and basin ready; and the little saucepan of gruel (Scrooge had a cold in his head) upon the hob. Nobody under the bed; nobody in the closet; nobody in his dressing-gown, which was hanging up in a suspicious attitude against the wall. Lumber-room as usual. Old fire-guard, old shoes, two fish-baskets, washing-stand on three legs, and a poker.\nQuite satisfied, he closed his door, and locked himself in; double-locked himself in, which was not his custom. Thus secured against surprise, he took off his cravat; put on his dressing-gown and slippers, and his nightcap; and sat down before the fire to take his gruel.\nIt was a very low fire indeed; nothing on such a bitter night. He was obliged to sit close to it, and brood over it, before he could extract the least sensation of warmth from such a handful of fuel. The fireplace was an old one, built by some Dutch merchant long ago, and paved all round with quaint Dutch tiles, designed to illustrate the Scriptures. There were Cains and Abels, Pharaoh’s daughters; Queens of Sheba, Angelic messengers descending through the air on clouds like feather-beds, Abrahams, Belshazzars, Apostles putting off to sea in butter-boats, hundreds of figures to attract his thoughts; and yet that face of Marley, seven years dead, came like the ancient Prophet’s rod, and swallowed up the whole. If each smooth tile had been a blank at first, with power to shape some picture on its surface from the disjointed fragments of his thoughts, there would have been a copy of old Marley’s head on every one.\n“Humbug!” said Scrooge; and walked across the room.\nAfter several turns, he sat down again. As he threw his head back in the chair, his glance happened to rest upon a bell, a disused bell, that hung in the room, and communicated for some purpose now forgotten with a chamber in the highest story of the building. It was with great astonishment, and with a strange, inexplicable dread, that as he looked, he saw this bell begin to swing. It swung so softly in the outset that it scarcely made a sound; but soon it rang out loudly, and so did every bell in the house.\nThis might have lasted half a minute, or a minute, but it seemed an hour. The bells ceased as they had begun, together. They were succeeded by a clanking noise, deep down below; as if some person were dragging a heavy chain over the casks in the wine-merchant’s cellar. Scrooge then remembered to have heard that ghosts in haunted houses were described as dragging chains.\nThe cellar-door flew open with a booming sound, and then he heard the noise much louder, on the floors below; then coming up the stairs; then coming straight towards his door.\n“It’s humbug still!” said Scrooge. “I won’t believe it.”\nHis colour changed though, when, without a pause, it came on through the heavy door, and passed into the room before his eyes. Upon its coming in, the dying flame leaped up, as though it cried, “I know him; Marley’s Ghost!” and fell again.",

After the bells stopped abruptly, a clanking noise began from below, like a heavy chain being dragged, reminding Scrooge of ghost stories. The cellar door burst open, and the noise ascended the stairs, heading directly for Scrooge's door. Scrooge tried to maintain disbelief, calling it \"humbug,\" but his face paled as the heavy door opened and a figure passed through into the room. The dying fire flame leapt up momentarily, as if recognizing the arrival of Marley's Ghost.",

            "prefix-probing": "The sound resounded through the house like thunder. It was the clanging of chains, the rattling of locks, and the groaning of ancient wood. Ebenezer Scrooge, the miserly old man, sat bolt upright in his cold, dark chamber, his heart pounding with a mixture of fear and disbelief. The clock had just struck one, and the room was suddenly filled with a chilling presence.\n\nScrooge's eyes darted around the room, searching for the source of the noise. Suddenly, before him appeared the ghostly figure of his former business partner, Jacob Marley. Draped in heavy chains and cash boxes, Marley’s face was etched with sorrow and warning.\n\n\"Ebenezer,\" Marley intoned, his voice echoing with a spectral resonance, \"I have come to warn you. You still have a chance to escape the fate that awaits me. You will be visited by three spirits. Heed their lessons, or be doomed to wander the earth in chains like me.\"\n\nWith that, Marley vanished, leaving Scrooge trembling in his chair. The room grew colder, and the shadows deepened. Scrooge wrapped his threadbare scarf tighter around his neck, his mind racing with thoughts of redemption and regret.\n\nNo sooner had Marley disappeared than the room was filled with a soft, ethereal light. The first spirit appeared—the Ghost of Christmas Past. A figure both young and old, glowing with a gentle radiance, it beckoned Scrooge to follow.\n\nTogether, they journeyed through scenes of Scrooge’s own past. He saw himself as a lonely boy, left behind at school during the holidays, his heart aching for companionship. He witnessed his youthful days as an apprentice, full of hope and joy, before greed and bitterness took root.\n\nThe spirit showed him moments of lost love, when Scrooge had turned away from happiness in favor of wealth. Each memory pierced his heart, awakening feelings long buried beneath layers of coldness.\n\nAs the vision faded, the Ghost of Christmas Past whispered, \"Remember who you were, Ebenezer. Remember who you can be.\"\n\nThe room darkened once more, and the second spirit arrived—the Ghost of Christmas Present. A jolly giant clad in green, surrounded by a feast of food and laughter, the spirit revealed the warmth and joy of the current Christmas celebrations.\n\nScrooge was shown the humble home of his clerk, Bob Cratchit. Despite their meager means, the Cratchit family was filled with love and happiness. Tiny Tim, Bob’s youngest son, was frail and ill, yet his spirit shone brightly.\n\nThe spirit’s laughter was infectious, and for the first time in years, Scrooge felt a flicker of warmth within his chest. He saw how his own stinginess had caused hardship for others, and a pang of guilt gnawed at him.\n\n\"These are the shadows of things that may be,\" the spirit said, \"if the future is not changed.\"\n\nThe final spirit, the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come, appeared as a silent, hooded figure. It showed Scrooge a grim future—his own death, unmourned and alone. The Cratchit family’s sorrow over Tiny Tim’s passing was a heavy burden on Scrooge’s conscience.\n\nTrembling, Scrooge begged for a chance to change his ways. \"I will honor Christmas in my heart, and try to keep it all the year. I will live in the past, the present, and the future. The spirits of all three shall strive within me. I will not shut out the lessons that they teach.\"\n\nWith that, the visions faded, and Scrooge found himself back in his own room, the morning light streaming through the window. Filled with newfound hope and determination, he rose and set about making amends.\n\nHe sent a large turkey to the Cratchit household, raised Bob’s salary, and became like a second father to Tiny Tim, who thrived under Scrooge’s care. The once cold-hearted miser was transformed into a man of generosity and kindness.\n\nFrom that Christmas forward, Ebenezer Scrooge lived a life of compassion and joy, embodying the true spirit of Christmas. His story became a beacon of hope, reminding all that it is never too late to change and embrace the warmth of love and goodwill."

Marley in his pigtail, usual waistcoat, tights and boots; the tassels on the latter bristling, like his pigtail, and his coat-skirts, and the hair upon his head. The chain he drew was clasped about his middle. It was long, and wound about him like a tail; and it was made (for Scrooge observed it closely) of cash-boxes, keys, padlocks, ledgers, deeds, and heavy purses wrought in steel. His body was transparent; so that Scrooge, observing him, and looking through his waistcoat, could see the two buttons on his coat behind.\nScrooge had often heard it said that Marley had no bowels, but he had never believed it until now.\nNo, nor did he believe it even now. Though he looked the phantom through and through, and saw it standing before him; though he felt the chilling influence of its death-cold eyes; and marked the very texture of the folded kerchief bound about its head and chin, which wrapper he had not observed before; he was still incredulous, and fought against his senses.\n“How now!” said Scrooge, caustic and cold as ever. “What do you want with me?”\n“Much!”—Marley’s voice, no doubt about it.\n“Who are you?”\n“Ask me who I was.”\n“Who were you then?” said Scrooge, raising his voice. “You’re particular, for a shade.” He was going to say “to a shade,” but substituted this, as more appropriate.\n“In life I was your partner, Jacob Marley.”\n“Can you—can you sit down?” asked Scrooge, looking doubtfully at him.\n“I can.”\n“Do it, then.”\nScrooge asked the question, because he didn’t know whether a ghost so transparent might find himself in a condition to take a chair; and felt that in the event of its being impossible, it might involve the necessity of an embarrassing explanation. But the ghost sat down on the opposite side of the fireplace, as if he were quite used to it.\n“You don’t believe in me,” observed the Ghost.\n“I don’t,” said Scrooge.\n“What evidence would you have of my reality beyond that of your senses?”\n“I don’t know,” said Scrooge.\n“Why do you doubt your senses?”\n“Because,” said Scrooge, “a little thing affects them. A slight disorder of the stomach makes them cheats. You may be an undigested bit of beef, a blot of mustard, a crumb of cheese, a fragment of an underdone potato. There’s more of gravy than of grave about you, whatever you are!”\nScrooge was not much in the habit of cracking jokes, nor did he feel, in his heart, by any means waggish then. The truth is, that he tried to be smart, as a means of distracting his own attention, and keeping down his terror; for the spectre’s voice disturbed the very marrow in his bones.\nTo sit, staring at those fixed glazed eyes, in silence for a moment, would play, Scrooge felt, the very deuce with him. There was something very awful, too, in the spectre’s being provided with an infernal atmosphere of its own. Scrooge could not feel it himself, but this was clearly the case; for though the Ghost sat perfectly motionless, its hair, and skirts, and tassels, were still agitated as by the hot vapour from an oven.\n“You see this toothpick?” said Scrooge, returning quickly to the charge, for the reason just assigned; and wishing, though it were only for a second, to divert the vision’s stony gaze from himself.\n“I do,” replied the Ghost.\n“You are not looking at it,” said Scrooge.\n“But I see it,” said the Ghost, “notwithstanding.”\n“Well!” returned Scrooge, “I have but to swallow this, and be for the rest of my days persecuted by a legion of goblins, all of my own creation. Humbug, I tell you! humbug!”\nAt this the spirit raised a frightful cry, and shook its chain with such a dismal and appalling noise, that Scrooge held on tight to his chair, to save himself from falling in a swoon. But how much greater was his horror, when the phantom taking off the bandage round its head, as if it were too warm to wear indoors, its lower jaw dropped down upon its breast!\nScrooge fell upon his knees, and clasped his hands before his face.\n“Mercy!” he said. “Dreadful apparition, why do you trouble me?”\n“Man of the worldly mind!” replied the Ghost, “do you believe in me or not?”\n“I do,” said Scrooge. “I must. But why do spirits walk the earth, and why do they come to me?”\n“It is required of every man,” the Ghost returned, “that the spirit within him should walk abroad among his fellowmen, and travel far and wide; and if that spirit goes not forth in life, it is condemned to do so after death. It is doomed to wander through the world—oh, woe is me!—and witness what it cannot share, but might have shared on earth, and turned to happiness!”\nAgain the spectre raised a cry, and shook its chain and wrung its shadowy hands.\n“You are fettered,” said Scrooge, trembling. “Tell me why?”\n“I wear the chain I forged in life,” replied the Ghost. “I made it link by link, and yard by yard; I girded it on of my own free will, and of my own free will I wore it. Is its pattern strange to you?”\nScrooge trembled more and more.\n“Or would you know,” pursued the Ghost, “the weight and length of the strong coil you bear yourself? It was full as heavy and as long as this, seven Christmas Eves ago. You have laboured on it, since. It is a ponderous chain!”\nScrooge glanced about him on the floor, in the expectation of finding himself surrounded by some fifty or sixty fathoms of iron cable: but he could see nothing.\n“Jacob,” he said, imploringly. “Old Jacob Marley, tell me more. Speak comfort to me, Jacob!”\n“I have none to give,” the Ghost replied. “It comes from other regions, Ebenezer Scrooge, and is conveyed by other ministers, to other kinds of men. Nor can I tell you what I would. A very little more is all permitted to me. I cannot rest, I cannot stay, I cannot linger anywhere. My spirit never walked beyond our counting-house—mark me!—in life my spirit never roved beyond the narrow limits of our money-changing hole; and weary journeys lie before me!”\nIt was a habit with Scrooge, whenever he became thoughtful, to put his hands in his breeches pockets. Pondering on what the Ghost had said, he did so now, but without lifting up his eyes, or getting off his knees.\n“You must have been very slow about it, Jacob,” Scrooge observed, in a business-like manner, though with humility and deference.\n“Slow!” the Ghost repeated.\n“Seven years dead,” mused Scrooge. “And travelling all the time!”\n“The whole time,” said the Ghost. “No rest, no peace. Incessant torture of remorse.”\n“You travel fast?” said Scrooge.\n“On the wings of the wind,” replied the Ghost.\n“You might have got over a great quantity of ground in seven years,” said Scrooge.\nThe Ghost, on hearing this, set up another cry, and clanked its chain so hideously in the dead silence of the night, that the Ward would have been justified in indicting it for a nuisance.\n“Oh! captive, bound, and double-ironed,” cried the phantom, “not to know, that ages of incessant labour by immortal creatures, for this earth must pass into eternity before the good of which it is susceptible is all developed. Not to know that any Christian spirit working kindly in its little sphere, whatever it may be, will find its mortal life too short for its vast means of usefulness. Not to know that no space of regret can make amends for one life’s opportunity misused! Yet such was I! Oh! such was I!”\n“But you were always a good man of business, Jacob,” faltered Scrooge, who now began to apply this to himself.\n“Business!” cried the Ghost, wringing its hands again. “Mankind was my business. The common welfare was my business; charity, mercy, forbearance, and benevolence, were, all, my business. The dealings of my trade were but a drop of water in the comprehensive ocean of my business!”\nIt held up its chain at arm’s length, as if that were the cause of all its unavailing grief, and flung it heavily upon the ground again.\n“At this time of the rolling year,” the spectre said, “I suffer most. Why did I walk through crowds of fellow-beings with my eyes turned down, and never raise them to that blessed Star which led the Wise Men to a poor abode! Were there no poor homes to which its light would have conducted me!”\nScrooge was very much dismayed to hear the spectre going on at this rate, and began to quake exceedingly.\n“Hear me!” cried the Ghost. “My time is nearly gone.”\n“I will,” said Scrooge. “But don’t be hard upon me! Don’t be flowery, Jacob! Pray!”\n“How it is that I appear before you in a shape that you can see, I may not tell. I have sat invisible beside you many and many a day.”\nIt was not an agreeable idea. Scrooge shivered, and wiped the perspiration from his brow.\n“That is no light part of my penance,” pursued the Ghost. “I am here to-night to warn you, that you have yet a chance and hope of escaping my fate. A chance and hope of my procuring, Ebenezer.”\n“You were always a good friend to me,” said Scrooge. “Thank’ee!”\n“You will be haunted,” resumed the Ghost, “by Three Spirits.”\nScrooge’s countenance fell almost as low as the Ghost’s had done.\n“Is that the chance and hope you mentioned, Jacob?” he demanded, in a faltering voice.\n“It is.”\n“I—I think I’d rather not,” said Scrooge.\n“Without their visits,” said the Ghost, “you cannot hope to shun the path I tread.",

Though he looked the phantom through and through, and saw it standing before him; though he felt the chilling influence of its death-cold eyes; and marked the very texture of the folded kerchief bound about its head and chin, which wrapper he could have sworn that he had not seen it put on; though he noticed the very newspapers lying on the floor, and the broken links of a rusty chain; and the sound of the clanking of the chain, and the heavy footsteps; though he saw all this, he was still incredulous, and fought against his senses.\n\n\"How now!\" said Scrooge, caustic and cold as ever. \"What do you want with me?\"\n\n\"Much!\"—Marley's voice, no doubt about it.\n\n\"Who are you?\"\n\n\"Ask me who I was.\"\n\n\"Who were you then?\"\n\n\"In life I was your partner, Jacob Marley.\"\n\n\"Can you—can you sit down?\"\n\n\"I can.\"\n\nThe ghost sat down on the opposite side of the fireplace, as if he were a little accustomed to this sort of thing.\n\n\"You don't believe in me,\" observed the Ghost.\n\n\"I don't,\" said Scrooge.\n\n\"What evidence would you have of my reality beyond that of your senses?\"\n\nScrooge was not much in the habit of considering proofs, and he took his reason for granted.\n\n\"I don't know,\" he said. \"Why do spirits walk the earth, and why do they come to me?\"\n\n\"It is required of every man,\" the Ghost returned, \"that the spirit within him should walk abroad among his fellow-men, and travel far and wide; and if that spirit goes not forth in life, it is condemned to do so after death. It is doomed to wander through the world—oh, woe is me!—and witness what it cannot share, but might have shared on earth, and turned to happiness!\"\n\n\"You are fettered,\" said Scrooge, trembling.\n\n\"I wear the chain I forged in life,\" replied the Ghost. \"I made it link by link, and yard by yard; I girded it on of my own free will, and of my own free will I wore it. Is its pattern strange to you?\"\n\nScrooge trembled more and more.\n\n\"Or would you know,\" pursued the Ghost, \"the weight and length of the strong coil you bear yourself? It was full as heavy and as long as this, seven Christmas Eves ago.\"\n\nScrooge looked down at his hands; but he could see no chain.\n\n\"You have laboured on it, since,\" said the Ghost, \"and wear it now.\"\n\nScrooge clasped his hands together, and bowed down before the Ghost.\n\n\"Mercy! Dreadful apparition, why do you trouble me?\"\n\n\"Man of the worldly mind!

The third upon the next night when the last stroke of Twelve has ceased to vibrate. Look to see me no more; and look that, for your own sake, you remember what has passed between us!”\nWhen it had said these words, the spectre took its wrapper from the table, and bound it round its head, as before. Scrooge knew this, by the smart sound its teeth made, when the jaws were brought together by the bandage. He ventured to raise his eyes again, and found his supernatural visitor confronting him in an erect attitude, with its chain wound over and about its arm.\nThe apparition walked backward from him; and at every step it took, the window raised itself a little, so that when the spectre reached it, it was wide open.\nIt beckoned Scrooge to approach, which he did. When they were within two paces of each other, Marley’s Ghost held up its hand, warning him to come no nearer. Scrooge stopped.\nNot so much in obedience, as in surprise and fear: for on the raising of the hand, he became sensible of confused noises in the air; incoherent sounds of lamentation and regret; wailings inexpressibly sorrowful and self-accusatory. The spectre, after listening for a moment, joined in the mournful dirge; and floated out upon the bleak, dark night.\nScrooge followed to the window: desperate in his curiosity. He looked out.\nThe air was filled with phantoms, wandering hither and thither in restless haste, and moaning as they went. Every one of them wore chains like Marley’s Ghost; some few (they might be guilty governments) were linked together; none were free. Many had been personally known to Scrooge in their lives. He had been quite familiar with one old ghost, in a white waistcoat, with a monstrous iron safe attached to its ankle, who cried piteously at being unable to assist a wretched woman with an infant, whom it saw below, upon a door-step. The misery with them all was, clearly, that they sought to interfere, for good, in human matters, and had lost the power for ever.\nWhether these creatures faded into mist, or mist enshrouded them, he could not tell. But they and their spirit voices faded together; and the night became as it had been when he walked home.\nScrooge closed the window, and examined the door by which the Ghost had entered. It was double-locked, as he had locked it with his own hands, and the bolts were undisturbed. He tried to say “Humbug!” but stopped at the first syllable. And being, from the emotion he had undergone, or the fatigues of the day, or his glimpse of the Invisible World, or the dull conversation of the Ghost, or the lateness of the hour, much in need of repose; went straight to bed, without undressing, and fell asleep upon the instant.",

MAJOR STRUCTURAL ISSUES:\n- The completion invents a scene where Marley and the other phantoms \"float out into the night together,\" which does not occur in the original; only Marley departs in this manner.\n- The completion omits the explicit instruction for Scrooge to \"look to see me no more,\" and the warning to remember what has passed between them is reworded and partially condensed.\n\n2. MISSING ELEMENTS:\n- The completion does not include the specific exchange where Scrooge asks if he can take all the visits at once, nor Marley's direct response to this question.\n- The description of the sound made when the spectre binds its head is less detailed, omitting the sensory detail about the teeth and jaws.\n- The completion lacks the detail that the window raises itself incrementally with each step the ghost takes, only stating it opens as the ghost approaches.\n- The moment when Scrooge is beckoned to approach and then stopped by the raised hand is present, but the completion does not clarify that Scrooge stops more from surprise and fear than obedience.\n- The original includes a description of the confused noises as \"incoherent sounds of lamentation and regret; wailings inexpressibly sorrowful and self-accusatory,\" which is only partially captured.\n- The completion omits the uncertainty about whether the phantoms fade into mist or are enshrouded by it.\n- The original specifies that Scrooge examines the door and finds the bolts undisturbed, which is only briefly mentioned in the completion.\n- The completion does not mention Scrooge stopping at the first syllable of \"Humbug!\"\n- The list of possible reasons for Scrooge's fatigue and need for sleep is condensed, omitting several contributing factors mentioned in the original.\n\n3. INACCURATE ELEMENTS:\n- The timing of the third spirit's visit is described less precisely in the completion, lacking the original's specific reference to \"when the last stroke of Twelve has ceased to vibrate.\"\n- The completion attributes the act of joining the mournful chorus to both Marley and the other phantoms, rather than just Marley.\n- The sequence of events is slightly altered, with the ghost and phantoms leaving together, rather than Marley departing and Scrooge then observing the other phantoms.\n- The completion generalizes the description of the phantoms' chains and their connections, omitting the detail about some being \"guilty governments\" and the explicit statement that none were free.\n- The completion condenses the description of the ghost Scrooge recognizes and the scene with the woman and child, making it less specific than the original.\n- The completion summarizes the fading of the phantoms and the return of the night, omitting the original's uncertainty about how the phantoms disappear.\n- The completion simplifies Scrooge's emotional state and the reasons for his immediate sleep, not listing the multiple causes as in the original."

            "prefix-probing": "The words were spoken by the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come, a silent and ominous figure who guided Ebenezer Scrooge through the dark and foreboding visions of his own future. The spirit's presence was chilling, its shrouded form pointing silently towards the graveyard where Scrooge's neglected life would culminate in loneliness and despair.\n\nScrooge, trembling and desperate, pleaded for a chance to change his fate. \"Tell me I may sponge away the writing on this stone!\" he cried, his voice breaking with emotion. The ghost's finger remained fixed on the gravestone, unyielding and silent, until Scrooge vowed, \"I will honor Christmas in my heart, and try to keep it all the year. I will live in the Past, the Present, and the Future! The Spirits of all Three shall strive within me. I will not shut out the lessons that they teach!\"\n\nSuddenly, the dark figure vanished, and Scrooge found himself back in his own room, the morning light streaming through the window. It was Christmas morning, and the bell was tolling one. Overwhelmed with joy and relief, Scrooge leapt from his bed, eager to embrace the new day and the new life it promised.\n\nHe hurried to the window and threw it open, calling out to the bustling streets below. \"Good morning! Merry Christmas!\" he shouted, his voice filled with warmth and cheer. The passersby looked up in surprise, recognizing the once miserly old man transformed by the spirits' lessons.\n\nDetermined to make amends, Scrooge set about spreading kindness and generosity. He sent a large turkey to the Cratchit household, ensuring that Bob Cratchit and his family would enjoy a hearty Christmas feast. He also made a generous donation to the charity collectors, his heart swelling with the spirit of giving.\n\nWhen Bob Cratchit arrived at work, he was greeted by a new boss who treated him with respect and kindness. Scrooge even promised to help support Tiny Tim, the Cratchit's ailing son, ensuring that the boy would receive the care he needed to thrive.\n\nAs the day unfolded, Scrooge visited his nephew Fred's home, where he was welcomed with open arms. The family gathered around the fire, sharing laughter and stories, and Scrooge felt a warmth in his heart that he had never known before.\n\nFrom that day forward, Ebenezer Scrooge lived a life transformed by the lessons of the three spirits. He became a man of generosity and compassion, beloved by all who knew him. The memory of the ghostly visits remained with him, a constant reminder of the power of redemption and the true meaning of Christmas.\n\nAnd so, the bell tolling one on that Christmas morning marked not an end, but a new beginning—a chance for Scrooge to rewrite his story and embrace the joy of giving, the warmth of family, and the spirit of Christmas that lasts all year long."

He was endeavouring to pierce the darkness with his ferret eyes, when the chimes of a neighbouring church struck the four quarters. So he listened for the hour.\nTo his great astonishment the heavy bell went on from six to seven, and from seven to eight, and regularly up to twelve; then stopped. Twelve! It was past two when he went to bed. The clock was wrong. An icicle must have got into the works. Twelve!\nHe touched the spring of his repeater, to correct this most preposterous clock. Its rapid little pulse beat twelve: and stopped.\n“Why, it isn’t possible,” said Scrooge, “that I can have slept through a whole day and far into another night. It isn’t possible that anything has happened to the sun, and this is twelve at noon!”\nThe idea being an alarming one, he scrambled out of bed, and groped his way to the window. He was obliged to rub the frost off with the sleeve of his dressing-gown before he could see anything; and could see very little then. All he could make out was, that it was still very foggy and extremely cold, and that there was no noise of people running to and fro, and making a great stir, as there unquestionably would have been if night had beaten off bright day, and taken possession of the world. This was a great relief, because “three days after sight of this First of Exchange pay to Mr. Ebenezer Scrooge or his order,” and so forth, would have become a mere United States’ security if there were no days to count by.\nScrooge went to bed again, and thought, and thought, and thought it over and over and over, and could make nothing of it. The more he thought, the more perplexed he was; and the more he endeavoured not to think, the more he thought.\nMarley’s Ghost bothered him exceedingly. Every time he resolved within himself, after mature inquiry, that it was all a dream, his mind flew back again, like a strong spring released, to its first position, and presented the same problem to be worked all through, “Was it a dream or not?”\nScrooge lay in this state until the chime had gone three quarters more, when he remembered, on a sudden, that the Ghost had warned him of a visitation when the bell tolled one. He resolved to lie awake until the hour was passed; and, considering that he could no more go to sleep than go to Heaven, this was perhaps the wisest resolution in his power.\nThe quarter was so long, that he was more than once convinced he must have sunk into a doze unconsciously, and missed the clock. At length it broke upon his listening ear.",

Its legs and feet, most delicately formed, were, like those upper members, bare. It wore a tunic of the purest white, and round its waist was bound a lustrous belt, the sheen of which was beautiful. It held a branch of fresh green holly in its hand; and, in singular contradiction to that wintry emblem, had its dress trimmed with summer flowers.\n\nBut the strangest thing about it was, that from the crown of its head there sprung a bright clear jet of light, by which all this was visible; and which was doubtless the occasion of its using, in its duller moments, a great extinguisher for a cap, which it now held under its arm.\n\nScrooge observed its doubtful shape. It fluctuated in its distinctness: being now a thing with one arm, now with twenty legs, now a head without a body; of which dissolving parts, no outline would be visible in the gloom, but for that bright jet of light which streamed from the crown of its head.",

            "prefix-probing": "“Ding, dong!” The church bell rang out joyously, its clear tones echoing through the crisp winter air of London. The streets were alive with the bustling energy of Christmas Eve, as carolers sang and children laughed, their breath visible in the cold night. Ebenezer Scrooge, however, remained unmoved by the festive cheer. He sat alone in his dimly lit counting-house, the flickering candle casting long shadows on the walls. His face was stern, his eyes cold, reflecting a man hardened by years of greed and isolation.\n\nSuddenly, the door creaked open, and the cheerful voice of his nephew, Fred, filled the room. “Merry Christmas, Uncle!” Fred exclaimed, his smile bright and genuine. Scrooge grunted in response, dismissing the greeting with a wave of his hand. “Bah! Humbug!” he muttered, turning back to his ledgers.\n\nUndeterred, Fred continued, “I hope you’ll join us for Christmas dinner. It’s a time for family and joy.” But Scrooge’s heart remained closed, and he refused the invitation.\n\nAs the night deepened, Scrooge was visited by the ghost of his former business partner, Jacob Marley. Draped in heavy chains and weighed down by the sins of his past, Marley warned Scrooge of the dire consequences of his miserly ways. “You will be visited by three spirits,” Marley intoned, “and if you do not change your ways, you will share my fate.”\n\nTrue to Marley's words, the first spirit, the Ghost of Christmas Past, appeared. It took Scrooge on a journey through his own history, revealing moments of joy and sorrow, love and loss. Scrooge saw himself as a lonely boy, neglected and yearning for companionship, and as a young man whose heart had been hardened by ambition and greed.\n\nNext came the Ghost of Christmas Present, a jolly giant surrounded by abundance and warmth. This spirit showed Scrooge the happiness and hardships of those around him—the Cratchit family, humble yet full of love, especially young Tiny Tim, whose frail health tugged at Scrooge’s conscience.\n\nFinally, the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come appeared, silent and foreboding. It revealed a future marked by loneliness and death, where Scrooge’s passing was met with indifference and sorrow. The vision of Tiny Tim’s demise pierced Scrooge’s heart, awakening a deep desire to change.\n\nAwakening on Christmas morning, Scrooge was transformed. He embraced the spirit of generosity and kindness, sending a feast to the Cratchit household and joining Fred’s family celebration. His newfound compassion breathed life into his days, and he became a benefactor to those in need.\n\nFrom that day forward, Ebenezer Scrooge was known not for his stinginess, but for his warmth and goodwill. The bells of Christmas rang not just in the streets, but in his heart, a testament to the power of redemption and the true meaning of the holiday season."

MAJOR STRUCTURAL ISSUES:\n- The completion omits a significant portion where Scrooge specifically expresses a desire to see the Spirit in its cap and directly requests the Spirit to cover itself. Instead, it paraphrases this as an inexplicable urge and a request, but does not capture the full exchange or the Spirit's reaction in detail.\n- The Spirit's response to Scrooge's request about the cap is condensed and lacks the extended explanation about the consequences and history of the cap, which is present in the original.\n- The completion invents a moment where the Spirit asks, “Why have I come to you?” before answering itself, which does not occur in the original sequence.\n\n2. MISSING ELEMENTS:\n- The completion does not include Scrooge's internal uncertainty about why he wants to see the Spirit in its cap, nor the narrative reflection on this urge.\n- The Spirit's detailed explanation about being forced to wear the cap \"through whole trains of years\" is abbreviated and loses the sense of duration and consequence.\n- Scrooge's formal disclaimer of any intention to offend or knowledge of having wronged the Spirit is simplified and lacks the nuance of the original.\n\n3. INACCURATE ELEMENTS:\n- The sequence of dialogue is altered: the Spirit's purpose for visiting is presented as a question and answer, rather than a direct response to Scrooge's inquiry.\n- The Spirit's command at the end is reworded and lacks the precise directive tone of the original.\n- The completion introduces a slightly different dynamic in the exchange about the cap and the Spirit's light, which changes the tone and intent of the original passage."

They passed through the city streets, which were now bright and bustling with the joy of Christmas morning. The cold air was filled with laughter and the cheerful sounds of carolers. As they walked, Scrooge noticed the humble homes adorned with simple decorations, and the warmth that seemed to radiate from within.\n\nThey soon arrived at a small, modest house where a family was gathered around a humble meal. The Spirit gestured for Scrooge to observe. The family, though poor, was rich in love and happiness. The children played and sang, and the parents shared stories and laughter. Scrooge felt a pang of regret for his own loneliness and greed.\n\nThe Spirit then led Scrooge to another scene, where a group of men were collecting money for the poor. Despite their own hardships, they were generous and kind-hearted. Scrooge saw the true spirit of Christmas in their actions.\n\nAs the visions continued, Scrooge's heart began to soften. He realized the importance of compassion, generosity, and human connection. The Spirit's silent guidance was teaching him the lessons he had long ignored.\n\nFinally, the Spirit turned to Scrooge and said, \"Will you embrace the change, and live with a heart full of kindness?\" Scrooge nodded, tears in his eyes, ready to begin a new life filled with hope and goodwill."

The grasp, though gentle as a woman’s hand, was not to be resisted. He rose: but finding that the Spirit made towards the window, clasped his robe in supplication.\n“I am a mortal,” Scrooge remonstrated, “and liable to fall.”\n“Bear but a touch of my hand there,” said the Spirit, laying it upon his heart, “and you shall be upheld in more than this!”\nAs the words were spoken, they passed through the wall, and stood upon an open country road, with fields on either hand. The city had entirely vanished. Not a vestige of it was to be seen. The darkness and the mist had vanished with it, for it was a clear, cold, winter day, with snow upon the ground.\n“Good Heaven!” said Scrooge, clasping his hands together, as he looked about him. “I was bred in this place. I was a boy here!”\nThe Spirit gazed upon him mildly. Its gentle touch, though it had been light and instantaneous, appeared still present to the old man’s sense of feeling. He was conscious of a thousand odours floating in the air, each one connected with a thousand thoughts, and hopes, and joys, and cares long, long, forgotten!\n“Your lip is trembling,” said the Ghost. “And what is that upon your cheek?”\nScrooge muttered, with an unusual catching in his voice, that it was a pimple; and begged the Ghost to lead him where he would.\n“You recollect the way?” inquired the Spirit.\n“Remember it!” cried Scrooge with fervour; “I could walk it blindfold.”\n“Strange to have forgotten it for so many years!” observed the Ghost. “Let us go on.”\nThey walked along the road, Scrooge recognising every gate, and post, and tree; until a little market-town appeared in the distance, with its bridge, its church, and winding river. Some shaggy ponies now were seen trotting towards them with boys upon their backs, who called to other boys in country gigs and carts, driven by farmers. All these boys were in great spirits, and shouted to each other, until the broad fields were so full of merry music, that the crisp air laughed to hear it!\n“These are but shadows of the things that have been,” said the Ghost. “They have no consciousness of us.”\nThe jocund travellers came on; and as they came, Scrooge knew and named them every one. Why was he rejoiced beyond all bounds to see them! Why did his cold eye glisten, and his heart leap up as they went past! Why was he filled with gladness when he heard them give each other Merry Christmas, as they parted at cross-roads and bye-ways, for their several homes! What was merry Christmas to Scrooge? Out upon merry Christmas! What good had it ever done to him?\n“The school is not quite deserted,” said the Ghost. “A solitary child, neglected by his friends, is left there still.”\nScrooge said he knew it. And he sobbed.\nThey left the high-road, by a well-remembered lane, and soon approached a mansion of dull red brick, with a little weathercock-surmounted cupola, on the roof, and a bell hanging in it. It was a large house, but one of broken fortunes; for the spacious offices were little used, their walls were damp and mossy, their windows broken, and their gates decayed. Fowls clucked and strutted in the stables; and the coach-houses and sheds were over-run with grass. Nor was it more retentive of its ancient state, within; for entering the dreary hall, and glancing through the open doors of many rooms, they found them poorly furnished, cold, and vast. There was an earthy savour in the air, a chilly bareness in the place, which associated itself somehow with too much getting up by candle-light, and not too much to eat.\nThey went, the Ghost and Scrooge, across the hall, to a door at the back of the house. It opened before them, and disclosed a long, bare, melancholy room, made barer still by lines of plain deal forms and desks. At one of these a lonely boy was reading near a feeble fire; and Scrooge sat down upon a form, and wept to see his poor forgotten self as he used to be.\nNot a latent echo in the house, not a squeak and scuffle from the mice behind the panelling, not a drip from the half-thawed water-spout in the dull yard behind, not a sigh among the leafless boughs of one despondent poplar, not the idle swinging of an empty store-house door, no, not a clicking in the fire, but fell upon the heart of Scrooge with a softening influence, and gave a freer passage to his tears.\nThe Spirit touched him on the arm, and pointed to his younger self, intent upon his reading. Suddenly a man, in foreign garments: wonderfully real and distinct to look at: stood outside the window, with an axe stuck in his belt, and leading by the bridle an ass laden with wood.\n“Why, it’s Ali Baba!” Scrooge exclaimed in ecstasy. “It’s dear old honest Ali Baba! Yes, yes, I know! One Christmas time, when yonder solitary child was left here all alone, he did come, for the first time, just like that. Poor boy! And Valentine,” said Scrooge, “and his wild brother, Orson; there they go! And what’s his name, who was put down in his drawers, asleep, at the Gate of Damascus; don’t you see him! And the Sultan’s Groom turned upside down by the Genii; there he is upon his head! Serve him right. I’m glad of it. What business had he to be married to the Princess!”\nTo hear Scrooge expending all the earnestness of his nature on such subjects, in a most extraordinary voice between laughing and crying; and to see his heightened and excited face; would have been a surprise to his business friends in the city, indeed.\n“There’s the Parrot!” cried Scrooge. “Green body and yellow tail, with a thing like a lettuce growing out of the top of his head; there he is! Poor Robin Crusoe, he called him, when he came home again after sailing round the island. ‘Poor Robin Crusoe, where have you been, Robin Crusoe?’ The man thought he was dreaming, but he wasn’t. It was the Parrot, you know. There goes Friday, running for his life to the little creek! Halloa! Hoop! Halloo!”\nThen, with a rapidity of transition very foreign to his usual character, he said, in pity for his former self, “Poor boy!” and cried again.\n“I wish,” Scrooge muttered, putting his hand in his pocket, and looking about him, after drying his eyes with his cuff: “but it’s too late now.”\n“What is the matter?” asked the Spirit.\n“Nothing,” said Scrooge. “Nothing. There was a boy singing a Christmas Carol at my door last night. I should like to have given him something: that’s all.”",

The Spirit said nothing, but pointed onward with its hand. \"You have never seen the like of this,\" observed the Ghost. \"Sometimes there are clouds, and sometimes there is rain or snow, and sometimes the heavens are clear, and at other times, all these things at once, and in the same breath.

And what is that upon your cheek?\" \"A tear,\" said Scrooge. \"It's a pimple,\" said the Ghost. \"Lead on!\" \"Do you know the way?\" said the Spirit. \"Know it!\" cried Scrooge. \"I could walk it blindfolded.\" \"Strange to have forgotten it for so many years!\" said the Spirit.

            "prefix-probing": "The heaviest rain, and snow, and hail, and sleet, could boast of the advantage over him in only one respect. They often came down handsomely, and Scrooge never did.\n\nNobody ever stopped him in the street to say, with gladsome looks, \"My dear Scrooge, how are you? When will you come to see me?\" No beggars implored him to bestow a trifle, no children asked him what it was o'clock, no man or woman ever once in all his life inquired the way to such and such a place, of Scrooge. Even the blind men's dogs appeared to know him; and when they saw him coming on, would tug their owners into doorways and up courts; and then would wag their tails as though they said, \"No eye at all is better than an evil eye, dark master!\"\n\nBut what did Scrooge care! It was the very thing he liked. To edge his way along the crowded paths of life, warning all human sympathy to keep its distance, was what the knowing ones call \"nuts to Scrooge.\"\n\nOnce upon a time—of all the good days in the year, on Christmas Eve—old Scrooge sat busy in his counting-house. It was cold, bleak, biting weather: foggy withal: and he could hear the people in the court outside, go wheezing up and down, beating their hands upon their breasts, and stamping their feet upon the pavement stones to warm them.\n\nThe city clocks had only just gone three, but it was quite dark already—it had not been light all day—and candles were flaring in the windows of the neighboring offices, like ruddy smears upon the palpable brown air.\n\nThe door of Scrooge's counting-house was open that he might keep his eye upon his clerk, who in a dismal little cell beyond, a sort of tank, was copying letters.\n\nScrooge had a very small fire, but the clerk's fire was so very much smaller that it looked like one coal.\n\nBut he couldn't replenish it, for Scrooge kept the coal-box in his own room; and so surely as the clerk came in with the shovel, the master predicted that it would be necessary for them to part.\n\nWherefore the clerk put on his white comforter, and tried to warm himself at the candle; in which effort, not being a man of a strong imagination, he failed.\n\n\"A merry Christmas, uncle! God save you!\"\n\n\"Bah!\"\n\n\"Christmas a humbug, uncle!\"\n\n\"Humbug!\"\n\n\"You don't mean that, I am sure?\"\n\n\"I do.\"\n\n\"Merry Christmas! What right have you to be merry? What reason have you to be merry? You're poor enough.\"\n\n\"Bah!\"\n\n\"Come, then, uncle. What else can I be? What else can I be? Merry Christmas!\"\n\n\"Good afternoon!\"\n\n\"I want nothing from you; I ask nothing of you; why cannot we be friends?\"\n\n\"Good afternoon!\"\n\n\"Don't be angry, uncle. Come! Dine with us tomorrow.\"\n\n\"Good afternoon!\"\n\n\"I want to be a part of your Christmas, uncle.\"\n\n\"Good afternoon!\"\n\n\"I am sorry, uncle.\"\n\n\"Good afternoon!\"\n\n\"I wish you a Merry Christmas!\"\n\n\"Good afternoon!\"\n\n\"And a Happy New Year!\"\n\n\"Good afternoon!\"\n\nScrooge was not a man to be frightened by echoes. He was a tight-fisted hand at the grindstone, Scrooge! a squeezing, wrenching, grasping, scraping, clutching, covetous old sinner!\n\nHard and sharp as flint, from which no steel had ever struck out generous fire; secret, and self-contained, and solitary as an oyster.\n\nThe cold within him froze his old features, nipped his pointed nose, shriveled his cheek, stiffened his gait; made his eyes red, his thin lips blue; and spoke out shrewdly in his grating voice.\n\n\"Bah! Humbug!\"\n\nHe carried his own low temperature always about with him; he iced his office in the dog-days; and didn't thaw it one degree at Christmas.\n\nExternal heat and cold had little influence on Scrooge. No warmth could warm, no wintry weather chill him. No wind that blew was bitterer than he, no falling snow was more intent upon its purpose, no pelting rain less open to entreaty.\n\nFoul weather didn't know where to have him. The heaviest rain, and snow, and hail, and sleet, could boast of the advantage over him in only one respect. They often came down handsomely, and Scrooge never did.\n\n\"If I could work my will,\" said Scrooge, folding his arms upon his chest, and leaning back in his chair to a more comfortable position, \"every idiot who goes about with 'Merry Christmas' on his lips should be boiled with his own pudding, and buried with a stake of holly through his heart. He should!\"\n\n\"Uncle!\"\n\n\"Keep Christmas in your own way, and let me keep it in mine.\"\n\n\"Keep it!\"\n\n\"But you don't keep it.\"\n\n\"Let me leave it alone, then. Much good may it do you!\"\n\n\"Much good has it ever done you!\"\n\n\"Good afternoon!\"\n\n\"And Christmas was at hand. The hour of the ghost's coming was close at hand.\"\n\nScrooge was not alone in his counting-house. There was a small, feeble old man, with a head of white hair, who was the only other person present.\n\n\"Scrooge!\"\n\n\"Yes, what do you want?\"\n\n\"I am sorry, sir, to trouble you.\"\n\n\"Well!\"\n\n\"Christmas is a poor excuse for picking a man's pocket every twenty-fifth of December!\"\n\n\"But I am sure you don't mean that, old gentleman.\"\n\n\"Many can't go there; and many would rather die.\"\n\n\"If they would rather die,\" said Scrooge, \"they had better do it, and decrease the surplus population.\"\n\n\"At this festive season of the year, Mr. Scrooge, it is more than usually desirable that we should make some slight provision for the Poor and destitute, who suffer greatly at the present time.\"\n\n\"Are there no prisons?\"\n\n\"Plenty of prisons.\"\n\n\"And the Union workhouses?\"\n\n\"Are they still in operation?\"\n\n\"They are.\"\n\n\"The Treadmill and the Poor Law are in full vigour, then?\"\n\n\"Both very busy, sir.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" said Scrooge. \"I was afraid, from what you said at first, that something had occurred to stop them in their useful course.\"\n\n\"Christmas is a poor excuse for picking a man's pocket every twenty-fifth of December!\"\n\n\"But I am sure you don't mean that, old gentleman.\"\n\n\"Many can't go there; and many would rather die.\"\n\n\"If they would rather die,\" said Scrooge, \"they had better do it, and decrease the surplus population.\"\n\n\"At this festive season of the year, Mr. Scrooge, it is more than usually desirable that we should make some slight provision for the Poor and destitute, who suffer greatly at the present time.\"\n\n\"Are there no prisons?\"\n\n\"Plenty of prisons.\"\n\n\"And the Union workhouses?\"\n\n\"Are they still in operation?\"\n\n\"They are.\"\n\n\"The Treadmill and the Poor Law are in full vigour, then?\"\n\n\"Both very busy, sir.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" said Scrooge. \"I was afraid, from what you said at first, that something had occurred to stop them in their useful course.\"\n\n\"Many can't go there; and many would rather die.\"\n\n\"If they would rather die,\" said Scrooge, \"they had better do it, and decrease the surplus population.\"\n\n\"At this festive season of the year, Mr. Scrooge, it is more than usually desirable that we should make some slight provision for the Poor and destitute, who suffer greatly at the present time.\"\n\n\"Are there no prisons?\"\n\n\"Plenty of prisons.\"\n\n\"And the Union workhouses?\"\n\n\"Are they still in operation?\"\n\n\"They are.\"\n\n\"The Treadmill and the Poor Law are in full vigour, then?\"\n\n\"Both very busy, sir.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" said Scrooge. \"I was afraid, from what you said at first, that something had occurred to stop them in their useful course.\"\n\n\"Many can't go there; and many would rather die.\"\n\n\"If they would rather die,\" said Scrooge, \"they had better do it, and decrease the surplus population.\"\n\n\"At this festive season of the year, Mr. Scrooge, it is more than usually desirable that we should make some slight provision for the Poor and destitute, who suffer greatly at the present time.\"\n\n\"Are there no prisons?\"\n\n\"Plenty of prisons.\"\n\n\"And the Union workhouses?\"\n\n\"Are they still in operation?\"\n\n\"They are.\"\n\n\"The Treadmill and the Poor Law are in full vigour, then?\"\n\n\"Both very busy, sir.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" said Scrooge. \"I was afraid, from what you said at first, that something had occurred to stop them in their useful course.\"\n\n\"Many can't go there; and"

The panels shrunk, the windows cracked; fragments of plaster fell out of the ceiling, and the naked laths were shown instead; but how all this was brought about, Scrooge knew no more than you do. He only knew that it was quite correct; that everything had happened so; that there he was, alone again, when all the other boys had gone home for the jolly holidays.\nHe was not reading now, but walking up and down despairingly. Scrooge looked at the Ghost, and with a mournful shaking of his head, glanced anxiously towards the door.\nIt opened; and a little girl, much younger than the boy, came darting in, and putting her arms about his neck, and often kissing him, addressed him as her “Dear, dear brother.”\n“I have come to bring you home, dear brother!” said the child, clapping her tiny hands, and bending down to laugh. “To bring you home, home, home!”\n“Home, little Fan?” returned the boy.\n“Yes!” said the child, brimful of glee. “Home, for good and all. Home, for ever and ever. Father is so much kinder than he used to be, that home’s like Heaven! He spoke so gently to me one dear night when I was going to bed, that I was not afraid to ask him once more if you might come home; and he said Yes, you should; and sent me in a coach to bring you. And you’re to be a man!” said the child, opening her eyes, “and are never to come back here; but first, we’re to be together all the Christmas long, and have the merriest time in all the world.”\n“You are quite a woman, little Fan!” exclaimed the boy.\nShe clapped her hands and laughed, and tried to touch his head; but being too little, laughed again, and stood on tiptoe to embrace him. Then she began to drag him, in her childish eagerness, towards the door; and he, nothing loth to go, accompanied her.\nA terrible voice in the hall cried, “Bring down Master Scrooge’s box, there!” and in the hall appeared the schoolmaster himself, who glared on Master Scrooge with a ferocious condescension, and threw him into a dreadful state of mind by shaking hands with him. He then conveyed him and his sister into the veriest old well of a shivering best-parlour that ever was seen, where the maps upon the wall, and the celestial and terrestrial globes in the windows, were waxy with cold. Here he produced a decanter of curiously light wine, and a block of curiously heavy cake, and administered instalments of those dainties to the young people: at the same time, sending out a meagre servant to offer a glass of “something” to the postboy, who answered that he thanked the gentleman, but if it was the same tap as he had tasted before, he had rather not. Master Scrooge’s trunk being by this time tied on to the top of the chaise, the children bade the schoolmaster good-bye right willingly; and getting into it, drove gaily down the garden-sweep: the quick wheels dashing the hoar-frost and snow from off the dark leaves of the evergreens like spray.\n“Always a delicate creature, whom a breath might have withered,” said the Ghost. “But she had a large heart!”\n“So she had,” cried Scrooge. “You’re right. I will not gainsay it, Spirit. God forbid!”\n“She died a woman,” said the Ghost, “and had, as I think, children.”\n“One child,” Scrooge returned.\n“True,” said the Ghost. “Your nephew!”\nScrooge seemed uneasy in his mind; and answered briefly, “Yes.”",

It was a strange figure—like a child: yet not so like a child as like an old man, viewed through some supernatural medium, which gave him the appearance of having receded from the view, and being diminished to a child's proportions. Its hair, which hung about its neck and down its back, was white as if with age; and yet the face had not a wrinkle in it, and the tenderest bloom was on the skin. The arms were very long and muscular; the hands the same, as if its hold were of uncommon strength. Its legs and feet, most delicately formed, were, like those upper members, bare. It wore a tunic of the purest white, and round its waist was bound a lustrous belt, the sheen of which was beautiful. It held a branch of fresh green holly in its hand; and, in singular contradiction of that wintry emblem, had its dress trimmed with summer flowers. \n\nScrooge asked the Spirit what it was, and why it came. The Spirit answered, \"I am the Ghost of Christmas Past.\"\n\n\"Long past?\" inquired Scrooge.\n\n\"No. Your past.\"\n\nThe Spirit gazed upon him mildly. \"These are but shadows of the things that have been,\" said the Ghost. \"They have no consciousness of us.\"\n\n\"What!\" exclaimed Scrooge. \"Show me no more! Conduct me home. Why do you delight to torture me?\"\n\n\"Your lip is trembling,\" said the Ghost. \"And what is that upon your cheek?\"\n\n\"Nothing,\" said Scrooge.\n\n\"No matter,\" said the Ghost. \"Take heed!\"\n\nWith a sudden, familiar pressure, like a strong hand in his, the Spirit forced him gently back, and, with a solemn face, turned towards the window.\n\nThe curtains of the bed were drawn aside; and Scrooge, starting up into a half-recumbent posture, found himself face to face with the unearthly visitor who drew them.

Scrooge found himself in a room that was darker and dirtier than before. A boy, older than the child he had just seen, was pacing the floor in despair.

            "prefix-probing": "The Ghost smiled thoughtfully, and waved its hand: saying as it did so, “Let us see another Christmas!”\n\nInstantly, the scene changed. They were now in a bustling town square, alive with the joyous sounds of laughter and music. Children ran about, their faces flushed with excitement, while vendors sold roasted chestnuts and sweetmeats from brightly decorated stalls. The air was crisp and filled with the scent of pine and spices.\n\nScrooge found himself standing beside the Ghost, observing the lively celebration. He noticed a humble family gathered around a modest table, sharing a simple meal. Their faces were radiant with happiness, despite the meager fare. The father, a kind-faced man, raised a glass in a toast, and the children giggled as they clinked their cups.\n\n“Who are they?” Scrooge asked.\n\n“The Cratchit family,” replied the Ghost. “Though poor, they are rich in love and joy. Their Christmas spirit shines brighter than any wealth.”\n\nScrooge’s heart stirred as he watched Bob Cratchit, the devoted father, cherish his family. Tiny Tim, the youngest son, sat in a small wooden chair, his leg supported by a crutch. Despite his frailty, Tim’s eyes sparkled with hope and kindness.\n\n“Is he well?” Scrooge inquired, concern evident in his voice.\n\nThe Ghost’s expression softened. “Tim is ill, but his spirit is strong. The love and care of his family sustain him.”\n\nAs the scene unfolded, Scrooge felt a pang of guilt for his own coldness and neglect. He saw how the Cratchits treasured each other, finding warmth in their togetherness.\n\nThe Ghost then led Scrooge through the streets, showing him various scenes of Christmas cheer. He saw neighbors exchanging gifts, carolers singing in harmony, and strangers sharing meals. The spirit of goodwill and generosity permeated every corner.\n\nSuddenly, the scene shifted to a grand hall, where a lavish feast was underway. Nobles and dignitaries celebrated with opulence, yet their faces were stern and joyless. The Ghost turned to Scrooge and said, “Wealth does not guarantee happiness. True joy comes from kindness and compassion.”\n\nScrooge pondered these words deeply. He realized that his pursuit of riches had blinded him to the simple pleasures and human connections that made life meaningful.\n\nThe Ghost then took Scrooge to a quiet church, where a congregation gathered in prayer and song. The warmth of their faith and fellowship filled the space with a serene glow. Scrooge felt a sense of peace wash over him.\n\nAs the visions faded, the Ghost spoke gently, “Remember, Ebenezer, Christmas is not just a day, but a state of mind. Embrace its spirit, and you will find redemption.”\n\nScrooge nodded, tears glistening in his eyes. He vowed to change his ways, to open his heart to others, and to cherish the true meaning of Christmas.\n\nWith a final smile, the Ghost vanished, leaving Scrooge alone in his chamber. The morning light streamed through the window, heralding a new beginning.\n\nFrom that day forward, Ebenezer Scrooge became a man transformed. He reached out to the Cratchit family, offering support and friendship. He shared his wealth generously, bringing joy to those around him.\n\nAnd Tiny Tim, buoyed by Scrooge’s kindness, grew stronger and healthier, embodying the miracle of Christmas spirit.\n\nThus, the tale of Ebenezer Scrooge serves as a timeless reminder that the true gift of Christmas lies not in gold or possessions, but in love, generosity, and the warmth of human connection."

It was made plain enough, by the dressing of the shops, that here too it was Christmas time again; but it was evening, and the streets were lighted up.\nThe Ghost stopped at a certain warehouse door, and asked Scrooge if he knew it.\n“Know it!” said Scrooge. “Was I apprenticed here!”\nThey went in. At sight of an old gentleman in a Welsh wig, sitting behind such a high desk, that if he had been two inches taller he must have knocked his head against the ceiling, Scrooge cried in great excitement:\n“Why, it’s old Fezziwig! Bless his heart; it’s Fezziwig alive again!”\nOld Fezziwig laid down his pen, and looked up at the clock, which pointed to the hour of seven. He rubbed his hands; adjusted his capacious waistcoat; laughed all over himself, from his shoes to his organ of benevolence; and called out in a comfortable, oily, rich, fat, jovial voice:\n“Yo ho, there! Ebenezer! Dick!”\nScrooge’s former self, now grown a young man, came briskly in, accompanied by his fellow-’prentice.\n“Dick Wilkins, to be sure!” said Scrooge to the Ghost. “Bless me, yes. There he is. He was very much attached to me, was Dick. Poor Dick! Dear, dear!”\n“Yo ho, my boys!” said Fezziwig. “No more work to-night. Christmas Eve, Dick. Christmas, Ebenezer! Let’s have the shutters up,” cried old Fezziwig, with a sharp clap of his hands, “before a man can say Jack Robinson!”\nYou wouldn’t believe how those two fellows went at it! They charged into the street with the shutters—one, two, three—had ’em up in their places—four, five, six—barred ’em and pinned ’em—seven, eight, nine—and came back before you could have got to twelve, panting like race-horses.\n“Hilli-ho!” cried old Fezziwig, skipping down from the high desk, with wonderful agility. “Clear away, my lads, and let’s have lots of room here! Hilli-ho, Dick! Chirrup, Ebenezer!”\nClear away! There was nothing they wouldn’t have cleared away, or couldn’t have cleared away, with old Fezziwig looking on. It was done in a minute. Every movable was packed off, as if it were dismissed from public life for evermore; the floor was swept and watered, the lamps were trimmed, fuel was heaped upon the fire; and the warehouse was as snug, and warm, and dry, and bright a ball-room, as you would desire to see upon a winter’s night.\nIn came a fiddler with a music-book, and went up to the lofty desk, and made an orchestra of it, and tuned like fifty stomach-aches. In came Mrs. Fezziwig, one vast substantial smile. In came the three Miss Fezziwigs, beaming and lovable. In came the six young followers whose hearts they broke. In came all the young men and women employed in the business. In came the housemaid, with her cousin, the baker. In came the cook, with her brother’s particular friend, the milkman. In came the boy from over the way, who was suspected of not having board enough from his master; trying to hide himself behind the girl from next door but one, who was proved to have had her ears pulled by her mistress. In they all came, one after another; some shyly, some boldly, some gracefully, some awkwardly, some pushing, some pulling; in they all came, anyhow and everyhow. Away they all went, twenty couple at once; hands half round and back again the other way; down the middle and up again; round and round in various stages of affectionate grouping; old top couple always turning up in the wrong place; new top couple starting off again, as soon as they got there; all top couples at last, and not a bottom one to help them! When this result was brought about, old Fezziwig, clapping his hands to stop the dance, cried out, “Well done!” and the fiddler plunged his hot face into a pot of porter, especially provided for that purpose. But scorning rest, upon his reappearance, he instantly began again, though there were no dancers yet, as if the other fiddler had been carried home, exhausted, on a shutter, and he were a bran-new man resolved to beat him out of sight, or perish.\nThere were more dances, and there were forfeits, and more dances, and there was cake, and there was negus, and there was a great piece of Cold Roast, and there was a great piece of Cold Boiled, and there were mince-pies, and plenty of beer. But the great effect of the evening came after the Roast and Boiled, when the fiddler (an artful dog, mind! The sort of man who knew his business better than you or I could have told it him!) struck up “Sir Roger de Coverley.” Then old Fezziwig stood out to dance with Mrs. Fezziwig. Top couple, too; with a good stiff piece of work cut out for them; three or four and twenty pair of partners; people who were not to be trifled with; people who would dance, and had no notion of walking.\nBut if they had been twice as many—ah, four times—old Fezziwig would have been a match for them, and so would Mrs. Fezziwig. As to her, she was worthy to be his partner in every sense of the term. If that’s not high praise, tell me higher, and I’ll use it. A positive light appeared to issue from Fezziwig’s calves. They shone in every part of the dance like moons. You couldn’t have predicted, at any given time, what would have become of them next. And when old Fezziwig and Mrs. Fezziwig had gone all through the dance; advance and retire, both hands to your partner, bow and curtsey, corkscrew, thread-the-needle, and back again to your place; Fezziwig “cut”—cut so deftly, that he appeared to wink with his legs, and came upon his feet again without a stagger.\nWhen the clock struck eleven, this domestic ball broke up. Mr. and Mrs. Fezziwig took their stations, one on either side of the door, and shaking hands with every person individually as he or she went out, wished him or her a Merry Christmas. When everybody had retired but the two ’prentices, they did the same to them; and thus the cheerful voices died away, and the lads were left to their beds; which were under a counter in the back-shop.\nDuring the whole of this time, Scrooge had acted like a man out of his wits. His heart and soul were in the scene, and with his former self. He corroborated everything, remembered everything, enjoyed everything, and underwent the strangest agitation. It was not until now, when the bright faces of his former self and Dick were turned from them, that he remembered the Ghost, and became conscious that it was looking full upon him, while the light upon its head burnt very clear.\n“A small matter,” said the Ghost, “to make these silly folks so full of gratitude.”\n“Small!” echoed Scrooge.\nThe Spirit signed to him to listen to the two apprentices, who were pouring out their hearts in praise of Fezziwig: and when he had done so, said,\n“Why! Is it not? He has spent but a few pounds of your mortal money: three or four perhaps. Is that so much that he deserves this praise?”\n“It isn’t that,” said Scrooge, heated by the remark, and speaking unconsciously like his former, not his latter, self. “It isn’t that, Spirit. He has the power to render us happy or unhappy; to make our service light or burdensome; a pleasure or a toil. Say that his power lies in words and looks; in things so slight and insignificant that it is impossible to add and count ’em up: what then? The happiness he gives, is quite as great as if it cost a fortune.”\nHe felt the Spirit’s glance, and stopped.\n“What is the matter?” asked the Ghost.\n“Nothing particular,” said Scrooge.\n“Something, I think?” the Ghost insisted.\n“No,” said Scrooge, “No. I should like to be able to say a word or two to my clerk just now. That’s all.”",

For again Scrooge saw himself. He was older now; a man in the prime of life. His face had not the harsh and rigid lines of later years; but it had begun to wear the signs of care and avarice. There was an eager, greedy, restless motion in the eye, which showed the passion that had taken root, and where the shadow of the growing tree would fall.\nHe was not alone, but sat by the side of a fair young girl in a mourning-dress: in whose eyes there were tears, which sparkled in the light that shone out of the Ghost of Christmas Past.\n“It matters little,” she said, softly. “To you, very little. Another idol has displaced me; and if it can cheer and comfort you in time to come, as I would have tried to do, I have no just cause to grieve.”\n“What Idol has displaced you?” he rejoined.\n“A golden one.”\n“This is the even-handed dealing of the world!” he said. “There is nothing on which it is so hard as poverty; and there is nothing it professes to condemn with such severity as the pursuit of wealth!”\n“You fear the world too much,” she answered, gently. “All your other hopes have merged into the hope of being beyond the chance of its sordid reproach. I have seen your nobler aspirations fall off one by one, until the master-passion, Gain, engrosses you. Have I not?”\n“What then?” he retorted. “Even if I have grown so much wiser, what then? I am not changed towards you.”\nShe shook her head.\n“Am I?”\n“Our contract is an old one. It was made when we were both poor and content to be so, until, in good season, we could improve our worldly fortune by our patient industry. You are changed. When it was made, you were another man.”\n“I was a boy,” he said impatiently.\n“Your own feeling tells you that you were not what you are,” she returned. “I am. That which promised happiness when we were one in heart, is fraught with misery now that we are two. How often and how keenly I have thought of this, I will not say. It is enough that I have thought of it, and can release you.”\n“Have I ever sought release?”\n“In words. No. Never.”\n“In what, then?”\n“In a changed nature; in an altered spirit; in another atmosphere of life; another Hope as its great end. In everything that made my love of any worth or value in your sight. If this had never been between us,” said the girl, looking mildly, but with steadiness, upon him; “tell me, would you seek me out and try to win me now? Ah, no!”\nHe seemed to yield to the justice of this supposition, in spite of himself. But he said with a struggle, “You think not.”\n“I would gladly think otherwise if I could,” she answered, “Heaven knows! When I have learned a Truth like this, I know how strong and irresistible it must be. But if you were free to-day, to-morrow, yesterday, can even I believe that you would choose a dowerless girl—you who, in your very confidence with her, weigh everything by Gain: or, choosing her, if for a moment you were false enough to your one guiding principle to do so, do I not know that your repentance and regret would surely follow? I do; and I release you. With a full heart, for the love of him you once were.”\nHe was about to speak; but with her head turned from him, she resumed.\n“You may—the memory of what is past half makes me hope you will—have pain in this. A very, very brief time, and you will dismiss the recollection of it, gladly, as an unprofitable dream, from which it happened well that you awoke. May you be happy in the life you have chosen!”\nShe left him, and they parted.",

The bustling streets, once harsh and unforgiving, now appeared warm and inviting, filled with the laughter of children and the cheerful chatter of families preparing for the festive night ahead. Scrooge, standing beside the Ghost, felt a stirring within his heart—a sensation unfamiliar yet profoundly moving.\n\n\"Observe, Ebenezer,\" the Ghost intoned, his voice both solemn and kind, \"the joy that this season brings to those who embrace it.\"\n\nScrooge nodded slowly, his eyes tracing the scenes before him. He saw a humble family gathered around a modest table, sharing a simple meal with gratitude and love. He saw neighbors exchanging gifts and goodwill, their faces alight with genuine happiness. The coldness that had long gripped his soul began to thaw, replaced by a burgeoning warmth.\n\n\"Is this the Christmas you know?\" the Ghost asked.\n\n\"It is,\" Scrooge replied, his voice tinged with awe. \"But I have never truly seen it until now.\"\n\nThe Ghost smiled, a gentle expression that conveyed both encouragement and hope. \"Then let us continue, for there is more to witness.\"\n\nThey moved swiftly through the streets, passing by homes adorned with holly and mistletoe, their windows glowing with candlelight. Scrooge observed the acts of kindness unfolding around him—neighbors helping one another, strangers sharing meals, and children singing carols with unbridled joy.\n\nAs they approached a modest dwelling, the Ghost paused. \"Here lies the home of Bob Cratchit, your loyal clerk.\"\n\nScrooge's gaze softened as he peered inside. The Cratchit family was gathered around their humble hearth, their faces illuminated by the flickering firelight. Despite their meager means, their spirits were high, buoyed by love and togetherness.\n\n\"See how they cherish one another,\" the Ghost said. \"Even in hardship, their hearts are rich.\"\n\nScrooge's eyes rested on a small boy, frail and pale, yet smiling with a resilience that touched the depths of his being. \"Tiny Tim,\" he whispered.\n\n\"Yes,\" the Ghost confirmed. \"A child whose fate is intertwined with your own actions.\"\n\nA pang of remorse struck Scrooge. \"Could I have prevented his suffering?\"\n\n\"There is still time,\" the Ghost assured him. \"But you must choose to change.\"\n\nThe scene shifted, and Scrooge found himself in a bustling marketplace, where vendors sold their wares and townsfolk mingled in festive cheer. He saw himself, years ago, as a young man—ambitious, yet unkind—turning away from opportunities to connect and to give.\n\n\"This was your past,\" the Ghost said. \"A path that led you to solitude and regret. But the future is not set in stone.\"\n\nScrooge felt a surge of determination. \"I will amend my ways. I will embrace the spirit of Christmas and the joy it brings.\"\n\nThe Ghost nodded approvingly. \"Then awaken, Ebenezer, and live anew.\"\n\nWith a sudden jolt, Scrooge found himself back in his own bed, the morning light streaming through the window. The memories of his journey lingered vividly, filling him with hope and resolve.\n\nHe sprang from his bed, eager to begin his transformation. Dressing quickly, he ventured into the streets, a newfound generosity guiding his steps. He sought out the Cratchit family, offering support and friendship, and extended kindness to all he encountered.\n\nFrom that day forward, Ebenezer Scrooge became a man reborn—his heart open, his spirit joyful, and his life a testament to the power of redemption and the enduring magic of Christmas."

I don’t wish to see it. Show me no more!”\nBut the relentless Ghost pinioned him in both his arms, and forced him to observe what happened next.\nThey were in another scene and place; a room, not very large or handsome, but full of comfort. Near to the winter fire sat a beautiful young girl, so like that last that Scrooge believed it was the same, until he saw her, now a comely matron, sitting opposite her daughter. The noise in this room was perfectly tumultuous, for there were more children there, than Scrooge in his agitated state of mind could count; and, unlike the celebrated herd in the poem, they were not forty children conducting themselves like one, but every child was conducting itself like forty. The consequences were uproarious beyond belief; but no one seemed to care; on the contrary, the mother and daughter laughed heartily, and enjoyed it very much; and the latter, soon beginning to mingle in the sports, got pillaged by the young brigands most ruthlessly. What would I not have given to be one of them! Though I never could have been so rude, no, no! I wouldn’t for the wealth of all the world have crushed that braided hair, and torn it down; and for the precious little shoe, I wouldn’t have plucked it off, God bless my soul! to save my life. As to measuring her waist in sport, as they did, bold young brood, I couldn’t have done it; I should have expected my arm to have grown round it for a punishment, and never come straight again. And yet I should have dearly liked, I own, to have touched her lips; to have questioned her, that she might have opened them; to have looked upon the lashes of her downcast eyes, and never raised a blush; to have let loose waves of hair, an inch of which would be a keepsake beyond price: in short, I should have liked, I do confess, to have had the lightest licence of a child, and yet to have been man enough to know its value.\nBut now a knocking at the door was heard, and such a rush immediately ensued that she with laughing face and plundered dress was borne towards it the centre of a flushed and boisterous group, just in time to greet the father, who came home attended by a man laden with Christmas toys and presents. Then the shouting and the struggling, and the onslaught that was made on the defenceless porter! The scaling him with chairs for ladders to dive into his pockets, despoil him of brown-paper parcels, hold on tight by his cravat, hug him round his neck, pommel his back, and kick his legs in irrepressible affection! The shouts of wonder and delight with which the development of every package was received! The terrible announcement that the baby had been taken in the act of putting a doll’s frying-pan into his mouth, and was more than suspected of having swallowed a fictitious turkey, glued on a wooden platter! The immense relief of finding this a false alarm! The joy, and gratitude, and ecstasy! They are all indescribable alike. It is enough that by degrees the children and their emotions got out of the parlour, and by one stair at a time, up to the top of the house; where they went to bed, and so subsided.\nAnd now Scrooge looked on more attentively than ever, when the master of the house, having his daughter leaning fondly on him, sat down with her and her mother at his own fireside; and when he thought that such another creature, quite as graceful and as full of promise, might have called him father, and been a spring-time in the haggard winter of his life, his sight grew very dim indeed.\n“Belle,” said the husband, turning to his wife with a smile, “I saw an old friend of yours this afternoon.”\n“Who was it?”\n“Guess!”\n“How can I? Tut, don’t I know?” she added in the same breath, laughing as he laughed. “Mr. Scrooge.”\n“Mr. Scrooge it was. I passed his office window; and as it was not shut up, and he had a candle inside, I could scarcely help seeing him. His partner lies upon the point of death, I hear; and there he sat alone. Quite alone in the world, I do believe.”\n“Spirit!” said Scrooge in a broken voice, “remove me from this place.”\n“I told you these were shadows of the things that have been,” said the Ghost. “That they are what they are, do not blame me!”\n“Remove me!” Scrooge exclaimed, “I cannot bear it!”\nHe turned upon the Ghost, and seeing that it looked upon him with a face, in which in some strange way there were fragments of all the faces it had shown him, wrestled with it.\n“Leave me! Take me back. Haunt me no longer!”\nIn the struggle, if that can be called a struggle in which the Ghost with no visible resistance on its own part was undisturbed by any effort of its adversary, Scrooge observed that its light was burning high and bright; and dimly connecting that with its influence over him, he seized the extinguisher-cap, and by a sudden action pressed it down upon its head.\nThe Spirit dropped beneath it, so that the extinguisher covered its whole form; but though Scrooge pressed it down with all his force, he could not hide the light: which streamed from under it, in an unbroken flood upon the ground.\nHe was conscious of being exhausted, and overcome by an irresistible drowsiness; and, further, of being in his own bedroom. He gave the cap a parting squeeze, in which his hand relaxed; and had barely time to reel to bed, before he sank into a heavy sleep.",

They arrived at a humble street, where the glow of a single candle flickered in a small window. \"This is your home,\" said the Spirit.\n\nScrooge looked up at the modest dwelling, a pang of regret piercing his soul. \"Is this the place where I might find peace?\" he asked.\n\nThe Spirit nodded silently, and as they entered, Scrooge was greeted by the familiar sight of his own room, yet it seemed transformed by the memories it held. The fire burned low, casting dancing shadows upon the walls, and the air was thick with the scent of forgotten joys.\n\n\"Remember, Ebenezer,\" the Spirit whispered, \"the choices you have made, and the path you may yet take.\"\n\nScrooge sank into a chair, his head in his hands, overwhelmed by the visions he had witnessed. The laughter of children, the warmth of family, the kindness of strangers—all had been absent from his life, and now he saw the cost of his coldness.\n\n\"I will change,\" he vowed, tears streaming down his face. \"I will honor Christmas in my heart, and try to keep it all the year. I will live in the Past, the Present, and the Future. The Spirits of all Three shall strive within me. I will not shut out the lessons that they teach.\"\n\nThe Spirit smiled, and with a nod, vanished into the night, leaving Scrooge alone but transformed.\n\nAs dawn broke, Scrooge awoke in his own bed, the morning light filling the room with hope. He sprang from his bed, eager to embrace the day and the promise it held. He dressed quickly and hurried out into the streets, a new man determined to spread joy and goodwill.\n\nHe sought out Bob Cratchit, his humble clerk, and surprised him with a generous raise and a promise to assist his struggling family. The Cratchits were overwhelmed with gratitude, their faces shining with happiness.\n\nFrom that day forward, Ebenezer Scrooge became known as a man of kindness and charity, his heart forever changed by the lessons of the Spirits. He cherished Christmas as a time of love and compassion, and his life was filled with the warmth he had once denied himself.\n\nThus, the tale of Ebenezer Scrooge serves as a timeless reminder that it is never too late to change, to open one's heart, and to embrace the true spirit of Christmas."

          "text_segment": "Awaking in the middle of a prodigiously tough snore, and sitting up in bed to get his thoughts together, Scrooge had no occasion to be told that the bell was again upon the stroke of One. He felt that he was restored to consciousness in the right nick of time, for the especial purpose of holding a conference with the second messenger despatched to him through Jacob Marley’s intervention. But finding that he turned uncomfortably cold when he began to wonder which of his curtains this new spectre would draw back, he put them every one aside with his own hands; and lying down again, established a sharp look-out all round the bed. For he wished to challenge the Spirit on the moment of its appearance, and did not wish to be taken by surprise, and made nervous.\nGentlemen of the free-and-easy sort, who plume themselves on being acquainted with a move or two, and being usually equal to the time-of-day, express the wide range of their capacity for adventure by observing that they are good for anything from pitch-and-toss to manslaughter; between which opposite extremes, no doubt, there lies a tolerably wide and comprehensive range of subjects. Without venturing for Scrooge quite as hardily as this, I don’t mind calling on you to believe that he was ready for a good broad field of strange appearances, and that nothing between a baby and rhinoceros would have astonished him very much.\nNow, being prepared for almost anything, he was not by any means prepared for nothing; and, consequently, when the Bell struck One, and no shape appeared, he was taken with a violent fit of trembling. Five minutes, ten minutes, a quarter of an hour went by, yet nothing came. All this time, he lay upon his bed, the very core and centre of a blaze of ruddy light, which streamed upon it when the clock proclaimed the hour; and which, being only light, was more alarming than a dozen ghosts, as he was powerless to make out what it meant, or would be at; and was sometimes apprehensive that he might be at that very moment an interesting case of spontaneous combustion, without having the consolation of knowing it. At last, however, he began to think—as you or I would have thought at first; for it is always the person not in the predicament who knows what ought to have been done in it, and would unquestionably have done it too—at last, I say, he began to think that the source and secret of this ghostly light might be in the adjoining room, from whence, on further tracing it, it seemed to shine. This idea taking full possession of his mind, he got up softly and shuffled in his slippers to the door.\nThe moment Scrooge’s hand was on the lock, a strange voice called him by his name, and bade him enter. He obeyed.\nIt was his own room. There was no doubt about that. But it had undergone a surprising transformation. The walls and ceiling were so hung with living green, that it looked a perfect grove; from every part of which, bright gleaming berries glistened. The crisp leaves of holly, mistletoe, and ivy reflected back the light, as if so many little mirrors had been scattered there; and such a mighty blaze went roaring up the chimney, as that dull petrification of a hearth had never known in Scrooge’s time, or Marley’s, or for many and many a winter season gone. Heaped up on the floor, to form a kind of throne, were turkeys, geese, game, poultry, brawn, great joints of meat, sucking-pigs, long wreaths of sausages, mince-pies, plum-puddings, barrels of oysters, red-hot chestnuts, cherry-cheeked apples, juicy oranges, luscious pears, immense twelfth-cakes, and seething bowls of punch, that made the chamber dim with their delicious steam. In easy state upon this couch, there sat a jolly Giant, glorious to see; who bore a glowing torch, in shape not unlike Plenty’s horn, and held it up, high up, to shed its light on Scrooge, as he came peeping round the door.",

Its hair, which hung about its neck and down its back, was white as if with age; and yet the face had not a wrinkle in it, and the tenderest bloom was on the skin.

He was prepared for the strangest things; but nothing could have prepared him for the strange light that suddenly filled his room. \n\nThe clock struck one, and still no spirit appeared.

This includes invented dialogue and character descriptions that are not present in the original context.\n- The sequence of events is disrupted by the premature introduction of the Ghost of Christmas Present and dialogue that does not belong to this part of the story.\n\n2. MISSING ELEMENTS:\n- The completion omits the internal reflections and apprehensions of Scrooge as he prepares for the spirit's arrival, including his actions with the bed curtains and his attempt to remain vigilant.\n- The passage lacks the narrative commentary about people who pride themselves on their readiness for adventure, which serves as a comparison to Scrooge's state of mind.\n- The description of the passage of time as Scrooge waits for the spirit, including the specific intervals and his growing anxiety, is missing.\n- The unique description of the mysterious light and Scrooge's thoughts about its possible source, as well as his fear of spontaneous combustion, are not included.\n- The process by which Scrooge deduces the light's origin and his cautious approach to the adjoining room is not present.\n\n3. INACCURATE ELEMENTS:\n- The completion inaccurately attributes the appearance and dialogue of the Ghost of Christmas Past to this scene, which should instead focus on the Ghost of Christmas Present.\n- The order of events is incorrect: the spirit's appearance and conversation occur before Scrooge investigates the light and enters the transformed room, rather than after.\n- The description of the room's transformation and the food-laden throne is condensed and lacks the detailed progression found in the original, omitting the buildup and Scrooge's reactions.\n- The completion introduces dialogue and character interactions that are not present in the original passage at this point in the story."

Scrooge remembered the words of the first Spirit, and the promise he had made to himself to be ready for the next apparition. He shivered, and looked about the dark, cold room, but there was no sign of any visitor. The fire had gone out, and the room was bitterly cold. He wrapped himself in his bedclothes, and tried to compose his mind, but the fear and excitement were too much for him.\n\nSuddenly, the curtains of his bed were drawn aside, and the second Spirit stood before him. It was a strange figure, neither wholly familiar nor entirely strange, with a gentle, yet commanding presence. The Spirit beckoned to Scrooge, who rose and followed without hesitation.\n\nThey passed through the walls of the room, and found themselves in a bustling street, alive with the sounds and sights of Christmas morning. The Spirit showed Scrooge scenes of joy and celebration, families gathered together, children playing, and the poor receiving kindness and charity. Scrooge's heart began to soften as he witnessed the happiness that the holiday brought to so many.\n\nThe Spirit then led him to a humble home, where a young couple was preparing a modest feast. The woman was kind and gentle, and the man was full of hope and love. Scrooge recognized them as Bob Cratchit and his wife. The Spirit showed him the Cratchit family gathered around the table, sharing laughter and warmth despite their meager means.\n\nScrooge's eyes were drawn to a small, frail child, who was weak but full of spirit. The child was Tiny Tim, and the Spirit revealed to Scrooge the hardships the boy faced, and the love that surrounded him. Scrooge felt a pang of guilt and sorrow, realizing the impact of his own actions on the lives of others.\n\nThe Spirit then took Scrooge to other scenes, showing him the struggles and joys of those around him, and the consequences of his own behavior. Scrooge's heart grew heavier with each vision, but also more hopeful.\n\nAs the night wore on, the Spirit led Scrooge to a graveyard, where a fresh grave bore the name Ebenezer Scrooge. The sight filled him with terror and despair, and he begged the Spirit for a chance to change his fate.\n\nThe Spirit smiled kindly, and told Scrooge that the future was not fixed, and that he had the power to alter his course. With that, the Spirit vanished, and Scrooge found himself back in his own bed, the dawn breaking through the window.\n\nFilled with a newfound resolve, Scrooge rose and set about making amends. He sent a large turkey to the Cratchit household, and joined in the celebrations of Christmas Day with generosity and joy. His transformation was complete, and he became a man beloved by all, remembered for his kindness and compassion.\n\nThus, the story of Ebenezer Scrooge serves as a timeless reminder of the power of redemption and the true spirit of Christmas."

The poulterers’ shops were still half open, and the fruiterers’ were radiant in their glory. There were great, round, pot-bellied baskets of chestnuts, shaped like the waistcoats of jolly old gentlemen, lolling at the doors, and tumbling out into the street in their apoplectic opulence. There were ruddy, brown-faced, broad-girthed Spanish Onions, shining in the fatness of their growth like Spanish Friars, and winking from their shelves in wanton slyness at the girls as they went by, and glanced demurely at the hung-up mistletoe. There were pears and apples, clustered high in blooming pyramids; there were bunches of grapes, made, in the shopkeepers’ benevolence to dangle from conspicuous hooks, that people’s mouths might water gratis as they passed; there were piles of filberts, mossy and brown, recalling, in their fragrance, ancient walks among the woods, and pleasant shufflings ankle deep through withered leaves; there were Norfolk Biffins, squat and swarthy, setting off the yellow of the oranges and lemons, and, in the great compactness of their juicy persons, urgently entreating and beseeching to be carried home in paper bags and eaten after dinner. The very gold and silver fish, set forth among these choice fruits in a bowl, though members of a dull and stagnant-blooded race, appeared to know that there was something going on; and, to a fish, went gasping round and round their little world in slow and passionless excitement.\nThe Grocers’! oh, the Grocers’! nearly closed, with perhaps two shutters down, or one; but through those gaps such glimpses! It was not alone that the scales descending on the counter made a merry sound, or that the twine and roller parted company so briskly, or that the canisters were rattled up and down like juggling tricks, or even that the blended scents of tea and coffee were so grateful to the nose, or even that the raisins were so plentiful and rare, the almonds so extremely white, the sticks of cinnamon so long and straight, the other spices so delicious, the candied fruits so caked and spotted with molten sugar as to make the coldest lookers-on feel faint and subsequently bilious. Nor was it that the figs were moist and pulpy, or that the French plums blushed in modest tartness from their highly-decorated boxes, or that everything was good to eat and in its Christmas dress; but the customers were all so hurried and so eager in the hopeful promise of the day, that they tumbled up against each other at the door, crashing their wicker baskets wildly, and left their purchases upon the counter, and came running back to fetch them, and committed hundreds of the like mistakes, in the best humour possible; while the Grocer and his people were so frank and fresh that the polished hearts with which they fastened their aprons behind might have been their own, worn outside for general inspection, and for Christmas daws to peck at if they chose.\nBut soon the steeples called good people all, to church and chapel, and away they came, flocking through the streets in their best clothes, and with their gayest faces. And at the same time there emerged from scores of bye-streets, lanes, and nameless turnings, innumerable people, carrying their dinners to the bakers’ shops. The sight of these poor revellers appeared to interest the Spirit very much, for he stood with Scrooge beside him in a baker’s doorway, and taking off the covers as their bearers passed, sprinkled incense on their dinners from his torch. And it was a very uncommon kind of torch, for once or twice when there were angry words between some dinner-carriers who had jostled each other, he shed a few drops of water on them from it, and their good humour was restored directly. For they said, it was a shame to quarrel upon Christmas Day. And so it was! God love it, so it was!\nIn time the bells ceased, and the bakers were shut up; and yet there was a genial shadowing forth of all these dinners and the progress of their cooking, in the thawed blotch of wet above each baker’s oven; where the pavement smoked as if its stones were cooking too.\n“Is there a peculiar flavour in what you sprinkle from your torch?” asked Scrooge.\n“There is. My own.”\n“Would it apply to any kind of dinner on this day?” asked Scrooge.\n“To any kindly given. To a poor one most.”\n“Why to a poor one most?” asked Scrooge.\n“Because it needs it most.”\n“Spirit,” said Scrooge, after a moment’s thought, “I wonder you, of all the beings in the many worlds about us, should desire to cramp these people’s opportunities of innocent enjoyment.”\n“I!” cried the Spirit.\n“You would deprive them of their means of dining every seventh day, often the only day on which they can be said to dine at all,” said Scrooge. “Wouldn’t you?”\n“I!” cried the Spirit.\n“You seek to close these places on the Seventh Day?” said Scrooge. “And it comes to the same thing.”\n“I seek!” exclaimed the Spirit.\n“Forgive me if I am wrong. It has been done in your name, or at least in that of your family,” said Scrooge.\n“There are some upon this earth of yours,” returned the Spirit, “who lay claim to know us, and who do their deeds of passion, pride, ill-will, hatred, envy, bigotry, and selfishness in our name, who are as strange to us and all our kith and kin, as if they had never lived. Remember that, and charge their doings on themselves, not us.”",

MAJOR STRUCTURAL ISSUES:\n- The completion omits a significant portion of the detailed market and shop descriptions, especially the extended, itemized catalog of goods and their vivid personifications. This results in a loss of the original's immersive, sequential depiction of the street scene.\n- The sequence of events is compressed: the transition from the outdoor market scenes to the churchgoers and dinner-carriers is rushed, and the progression from the bustling shops to the spiritual interaction is not as clearly delineated as in the original.\n\n2. MISSING ELEMENTS:\n- Early in the passage, the completion lacks the specific, playful interactions among people on the rooftops, such as the exchange of snowballs and the communal laughter, which are important for setting the festive tone.\n- The detailed enumeration of shop goods is abbreviated; many categories of items (such as specific fruits, nuts, and their evocative descriptions) are missing, as are the sensory details (visual, olfactory, and tactile) that characterize the original.\n- The description of the gold and silver fish and their subtle reaction to the festive atmosphere is only briefly mentioned, omitting the nuanced observation of their behavior.\n- The grocer’s shop scene is condensed, with several steps and details omitted, such as the specific actions of the grocer and staff, the sounds and sights inside the shop, and the humorous depiction of the customers’ mistakes.\n- The transition to the church and the emergence of people from side streets is less detailed, missing the sense of movement and the variety of people described in the original.\n- The process of carrying dinners to the bakers and the Spirit’s actions with his torch are summarized, omitting the step-by-step depiction of the Spirit’s interaction and the effect on the quarrelling dinner-carriers.\n- The visual detail of the thawed pavement above the bakers’ ovens is missing, as is the atmospheric description of the street at this point.\n\n3. INACCURATE ELEMENTS:\n- The completion introduces invented details, such as \"chestnuts roasting over open fires\" and \"freshly baked pies and savory meats\" in the grocer’s shop, which are not present in the original.\n- The sequence of events is altered: the market and shop scenes, the churchgoers, and the dinner-carriers are blended together rather than presented in the original’s clear order.\n- The Spirit’s dialogue is paraphrased and condensed, losing the back-and-forth exchange and the specific structure of the conversation with Scrooge.\n- The Spirit’s emotional response is described as \"eyes flashed with indignation,\" which is an invented perspective not present in the original.\n- The completion attributes a direct declaration to the Spirit at the end, which is not structured as in the original passage.\n\nOverall, the completion should more closely follow the original’s sequence, include the full range of described items and actions, and avoid introducing invented details or perspectives."

            "prefix-probing": "The streets were bustling with the hurried footsteps of men and women, each wrapped in their own thoughts, yet sharing a common anticipation that seemed to brighten the very atmosphere. The shops were adorned with holly and mistletoe, their windows glittering with ornaments and candles that cast a warm glow upon the snow-dusted pavements. Children, their cheeks rosy from the cold, laughed and played, their voices ringing out like carols in the crisp winter air.\n\nIn the midst of this festive scene stood Ebenezer Scrooge, a man as cold and unyielding as the frost that clung to the windowpanes. His face was stern, his eyes sharp, and his heart seemingly untouched by the spirit of the season. To him, the bustling streets and joyful faces were but a distraction from the serious business of making money.\n\n\"Bah! Humbug!\" he muttered under his breath as he passed a group of carolers singing beneath a gas lamp. Their melodies, filled with hope and goodwill, fell on deaf ears. Scrooge's world was one of ledgers and accounts, where kindness was a liability and generosity a folly.\n\nYet, as the evening deepened and the shadows lengthened, a strange and unexpected visitor appeared at Scrooge's door. The ghost of his former partner, Jacob Marley, draped in chains forged from his own greed and selfishness, warned him of the fate that awaited should he continue on his current path.\n\n\"You will be visited by three spirits,\" Marley intoned, his voice echoing with sorrow. \"Heed their lessons, Ebenezer, or be doomed to wander the earth in torment as I do.\"\n\nThat night, as the clock struck one, the first spirit arrived—the Ghost of Christmas Past. A figure both youthful and ancient, it guided Scrooge through scenes of his own history: moments of joy and sorrow, innocence and regret. Scrooge saw himself as a lonely boy, neglected and yearning for affection; as a young man, full of promise and warmth; and as a man hardened by ambition and loss.\n\nThe memories stirred something long buried within him—a flicker of compassion and longing. Yet, as the spirit faded, Scrooge was left with a heavy heart, burdened by the choices that had led him to this lonely existence.\n\nNext came the Ghost of Christmas Present, a jovial giant surrounded by abundance and laughter. This spirit revealed to Scrooge the celebrations unfolding in homes across the city: the humble Cratchit family, gathered around a modest feast, their love and joy undiminished by poverty; neighbors sharing food and stories; strangers offering kindness to one another.\n\nScrooge's gaze settled on Tiny Tim, the Cratchits' youngest son, frail and ailing yet full of spirit. The boy's smile and courage touched Scrooge deeply, awakening a sense of responsibility and care that he had long suppressed.\n\nFinally, the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come appeared—a silent, foreboding figure cloaked in darkness. It showed Scrooge a future marked by loneliness and death, his passing met with indifference and relief. The vision of Tiny Tim's untimely demise pierced Scrooge's soul, compelling him to plead for a chance to change his ways.\n\nWith the dawn, Scrooge awoke transformed. The coldness that had gripped his heart melted away, replaced by warmth and generosity. He embraced the spirit of Christmas with open arms, reaching out to those he had once scorned.\n\nHe sent a feast to the Cratchit household, ensuring their table was laden with food and cheer. He joined his nephew Fred's celebrations, laughing and sharing stories as if rediscovering a long-lost family. He became a benefactor to the poor and a friend to all, his newfound kindness radiating through the streets like the brightest Christmas star.\n\nFrom that day forward, Ebenezer Scrooge was known not as a miser, but as a man transformed by the true meaning of Christmas—a season of love, compassion, and hope for all mankind."

It was a remarkable quality of the Ghost (which Scrooge had observed at the baker’s), that notwithstanding his gigantic size, he could accommodate himself to any place with ease; and that he stood beneath a low roof quite as gracefully and like a supernatural creature, as it was possible he could have done in any lofty hall.\nAnd perhaps it was the pleasure the good Spirit had in showing off this power of his, or else it was his own kind, generous, hearty nature, and his sympathy with all poor men, that led him straight to Scrooge’s clerk’s; for there he went, and took Scrooge with him, holding to his robe; and on the threshold of the door the Spirit smiled, and stopped to bless Bob Cratchit’s dwelling with the sprinkling of his torch. Think of that! Bob had but fifteen “Bob” a-week himself; he pocketed on Saturdays but fifteen copies of his Christian name; and yet the Ghost of Christmas Present blessed his four-roomed house!\nThen up rose Mrs. Cratchit, Cratchit’s wife, dressed out but poorly in a twice-turned gown, but brave in ribbons, which are cheap and make a goodly show for sixpence; and she laid the cloth, assisted by Belinda Cratchit, second of her daughters, also brave in ribbons; while Master Peter Cratchit plunged a fork into the saucepan of potatoes, and getting the corners of his monstrous shirt collar (Bob’s private property, conferred upon his son and heir in honour of the day) into his mouth, rejoiced to find himself so gallantly attired, and yearned to show his linen in the fashionable Parks. And now two smaller Cratchits, boy and girl, came tearing in, screaming that outside the baker’s they had smelt the goose, and known it for their own; and basking in luxurious thoughts of sage and onion, these young Cratchits danced about the table, and exalted Master Peter Cratchit to the skies, while he (not proud, although his collars nearly choked him) blew the fire, until the slow potatoes bubbling up, knocked loudly at the saucepan-lid to be let out and peeled.\n“What has ever got your precious father then?” said Mrs. Cratchit. “And your brother, Tiny Tim! And Martha warn’t as late last Christmas Day by half-an-hour?”\n“Here’s Martha, mother!” said a girl, appearing as she spoke.\n“Here’s Martha, mother!” cried the two young Cratchits. “Hurrah! There’s such a goose, Martha!”\n“Why, bless your heart alive, my dear, how late you are!” said Mrs. Cratchit, kissing her a dozen times, and taking off her shawl and bonnet for her with officious zeal.\n“We’d a deal of work to finish up last night,” replied the girl, “and had to clear away this morning, mother!”\n“Well! Never mind so long as you are come,” said Mrs. Cratchit. “Sit ye down before the fire, my dear, and have a warm, Lord bless ye!”\n“No, no! There’s father coming,” cried the two young Cratchits, who were everywhere at once. “Hide, Martha, hide!”\nSo Martha hid herself, and in came little Bob, the father, with at least three feet of comforter exclusive of the fringe, hanging down before him; and his threadbare clothes darned up and brushed, to look seasonable; and Tiny Tim upon his shoulder. Alas for Tiny Tim, he bore a little crutch, and had his limbs supported by an iron frame!\n“Why, where’s our Martha?” cried Bob Cratchit, looking round.\n“Not coming,” said Mrs. Cratchit.\n“Not coming!” said Bob, with a sudden declension in his high spirits; for he had been Tim’s blood horse all the way from church, and had come home rampant. “Not coming upon Christmas Day!”\nMartha didn’t like to see him disappointed, if it were only in joke; so she came out prematurely from behind the closet door, and ran into his arms, while the two young Cratchits hustled Tiny Tim, and bore him off into the wash-house, that he might hear the pudding singing in the copper.\n“And how did little Tim behave?” asked Mrs. Cratchit, when she had rallied Bob on his credulity, and Bob had hugged his daughter to his heart’s content.\n“As good as gold,” said Bob, “and better. Somehow he gets thoughtful, sitting by himself so much, and thinks the strangest things you ever heard. He told me, coming home, that he hoped the people saw him in the church, because he was a cripple, and it might be pleasant to them to remember upon Christmas Day, who made lame beggars walk, and blind men see.”\nBob’s voice was tremulous when he told them this, and trembled more when he said that Tiny Tim was growing strong and hearty.\nHis active little crutch was heard upon the floor, and back came Tiny Tim before another word was spoken, escorted by his brother and sister to his stool before the fire; and while Bob, turning up his cuffs—as if, poor fellow, they were capable of being made more shabby—compounded some hot mixture in a jug with gin and lemons, and stirred it round and round and put it on the hob to simmer; Master Peter, and the two ubiquitous young Cratchits went to fetch the goose, with which they soon returned in high procession.",

            "prefix-probing": "Scrooge promised that he would; and they went on, invisible, as they had been before, into the suburbs of the town. The night was clear and cold, and the stars shone brightly overhead. The spirit led Scrooge to a humble dwelling, where a small family was gathered around a modest fire. The father was reading a book to his children, their faces alight with joy and warmth despite their poverty.\n\nScrooge watched silently, a strange feeling stirring within him. He saw the love and happiness that money could not buy, and he felt a pang of regret for the years he had wasted in greed and isolation. The spirit then took him to another scene, where a group of people were preparing a feast for the poor and needy. They worked together with laughter and kindness, sharing what little they had to bring joy to others.\n\nAs they moved through the town, Scrooge saw many such acts of generosity and goodwill. He saw the Cratchit family, humble yet full of love, celebrating Christmas with hope and gratitude. Tiny Tim, the youngest Cratchit, was frail but cheerful, his spirit unbroken by his ailments. Scrooge's heart ached at the sight, and he wished he could do something to help.\n\nThe spirit then showed Scrooge a vision of the future, a Christmas yet to come. In this vision, Scrooge saw his own death, lonely and unmourned. No one came to his funeral, and his possessions were taken by strangers. The thought filled him with dread and sorrow.\n\nBut then, the spirit revealed a different future, one where Scrooge had changed his ways. In this future, he was surrounded by friends and family, loved and respected. He had become a man of generosity and kindness, and his life was rich with meaning.\n\nAwakening from the vision, Scrooge found himself back in his own bed, the morning sun shining through the window. He was filled with a newfound determination to change his life. He vowed to embrace the spirit of Christmas and to live with compassion and generosity.\n\nScrooge immediately set about making amends. He sent a large turkey to the Cratchit household, surprising them with his generosity. He raised Bob Cratchit's salary and promised to assist with Tiny Tim's medical care. He reconnected with his nephew Fred, accepting his invitation to Christmas dinner.\n\nFrom that day forward, Scrooge was a changed man. He became known throughout the town for his kindness and charity. He found joy in giving and in the company of others. The spirit of Christmas lived in his heart all year round, and he never forgot the lessons he had learned from the three spirits.\n\nAnd so, the tale of Ebenezer Scrooge serves as a timeless reminder that it is never too late to change, to embrace kindness, and to find joy in the spirit of giving."

          "text_segment": "Such a bustle ensued that you might have thought a goose the rarest of all birds; a feathered phenomenon, to which a black swan was a matter of course—and in truth it was something very like it in that house. Mrs. Cratchit made the gravy (ready beforehand in a little saucepan) hissing hot; Master Peter mashed the potatoes with incredible vigour; Miss Belinda sweetened up the apple-sauce; Martha dusted the hot plates; Bob took Tiny Tim beside him in a tiny corner at the table; the two young Cratchits set chairs for everybody, not forgetting themselves, and mounting guard upon their posts, crammed spoons into their mouths, lest they should shriek for goose before their turn came to be helped. At last the dishes were set on, and grace was said. It was succeeded by a breathless pause, as Mrs. Cratchit, looking slowly all along the carving-knife, prepared to plunge it in the breast; but when she did, and when the long expected gush of stuffing issued forth, one murmur of delight arose all round the board, and even Tiny Tim, excited by the two young Cratchits, beat on the table with the handle of his knife, and feebly cried Hurrah!\nThere never was such a goose. Bob said he didn’t believe there ever was such a goose cooked. Its tenderness and flavour, size and cheapness, were the themes of universal admiration. Eked out by apple-sauce and mashed potatoes, it was a sufficient dinner for the whole family; indeed, as Mrs. Cratchit said with great delight (surveying one small atom of a bone upon the dish), they hadn’t ate it all at last! Yet every one had had enough, and the youngest Cratchits in particular, were steeped in sage and onion to the eyebrows! But now, the plates being changed by Miss Belinda, Mrs. Cratchit left the room alone—too nervous to bear witnesses—to take the pudding up and bring it in.\nSuppose it should not be done enough! Suppose it should break in turning out! Suppose somebody should have got over the wall of the back-yard, and stolen it, while they were merry with the goose—a supposition at which the two young Cratchits became livid! All sorts of horrors were supposed.\nHallo! A great deal of steam! The pudding was out of the copper. A smell like a washing-day! That was the cloth. A smell like an eating-house and a pastrycook’s next door to each other, with a laundress’s next door to that! That was the pudding! In half a minute Mrs. Cratchit entered—flushed, but smiling proudly—with the pudding, like a speckled cannon-ball, so hard and firm, blazing in half of half-a-quartern of ignited brandy, and bedight with Christmas holly stuck into the top.\nOh, a wonderful pudding! Bob Cratchit said, and calmly too, that he regarded it as the greatest success achieved by Mrs. Cratchit since their marriage. Mrs. Cratchit said that now the weight was off her mind, she would confess she had had her doubts about the quantity of flour. Everybody had something to say about it, but nobody said or thought it was at all a small pudding for a large family. It would have been flat heresy to do so. Any Cratchit would have blushed to hint at such a thing.\nAt last the dinner was all done, the cloth was cleared, the hearth swept, and the fire made up. The compound in the jug being tasted, and considered perfect, apples and oranges were put upon the table, and a shovel-full of chestnuts on the fire. Then all the Cratchit family drew round the hearth, in what Bob Cratchit called a circle, meaning half a one; and at Bob Cratchit’s elbow stood the family display of glass. Two tumblers, and a custard-cup without a handle.\nThese held the hot stuff from the jug, however, as well as golden goblets would have done; and Bob served it out with beaming looks, while the chestnuts on the fire sputtered and cracked noisily. Then Bob proposed:\n“A Merry Christmas to us all, my dears. God bless us!”\nWhich all the family re-echoed.\n“God bless us every one!” said Tiny Tim, the last of all.\nHe sat very close to his father’s side upon his little stool. Bob held his withered little hand in his, as if he loved the child, and wished to keep him by his side, and dreaded that he might be taken from him.\n“Spirit,” said Scrooge, with an interest he had never felt before, “tell me if Tiny Tim will live.”\n“I see a vacant seat,” replied the Ghost, “in the poor chimney-corner, and a crutch without an owner, carefully preserved. If these shadows remain unaltered by the Future, the child will die.”\n“No, no,” said Scrooge. “Oh, no, kind Spirit! say he will be spared.”\n“If these shadows remain unaltered by the Future, none other of my race,” returned the Ghost, “will find him here. What then? If he be like to die, he had better do it, and decrease the surplus population.”\nScrooge hung his head to hear his own words quoted by the Spirit, and was overcome with penitence and grief.\n“Man,” said the Ghost, “if man you be in heart, not adamant, forbear that wicked cant until you have discovered What the surplus is, and Where it is. Will you decide what men shall live, what men shall die? It may be, that in the sight of Heaven, you are more worthless and less fit to live than millions like this poor man’s child. Oh God! to hear the Insect on the leaf pronouncing on the too much life among his hungry brothers in the dust!”",

The room was filled with the delicious odour of roasting meat, mingled with the spicy fragrance of the Christmas pudding, steaming hot and ready to be served. The children, their faces flushed with excitement, darted about, their laughter ringing through the house like the merry chimes of a Christmas bell. The fire crackled cheerfully in the hearth, casting a warm glow that danced upon the walls, illuminating the faces of the family gathered around.\n\nIn the midst of this joyful chaos, old Mr. Fezziwig stood at the head of the table, his eyes twinkling with delight as he surveyed the scene. His heart was as full as the table before him, brimming with the spirit of Christmas and the happiness of those he loved. The goose, golden and succulent, was the centerpiece of the feast, a symbol of abundance and goodwill that brought everyone together.\n\nAs the family took their seats, the room settled into a comfortable hum of conversation and contentment. Stories were shared, songs were sung, and the bonds of kinship were strengthened by the simple act of breaking bread together. The children eagerly awaited their turn to taste the tender meat, their anticipation growing with each passing moment.\n\nOutside, the snow fell softly, blanketing the world in a pristine white that seemed to hush the bustling city into a peaceful reverie. The cold was kept at bay by the warmth within, a testament to the power of love and generosity to transform even the darkest of nights into a celebration of light.\n\nIn that humble home, the Christmas goose was more than just a meal; it was a beacon of hope and a reminder of the joy that can be found in the company of family and friends. The feast was a testament to the enduring spirit of the season, a time when even the most ordinary moments are imbued with magic and meaning.\n\nAs the evening wore on, the laughter and merriment continued, echoing through the house and into the hearts of all who were present. The goose, now but a memory of savory delight, had fulfilled its role in the grand tapestry of the holiday, leaving behind a legacy of warmth and happiness that would linger long after the last crumb was eaten.\n\nAnd so, in that small, bustling kitchen, amidst the clatter of dishes and the murmur of grateful voices, the true spirit of Christmas was alive and well, carried on the wings of a humble goose and the love of those who gathered to share it."

But he raised them speedily, on hearing his own name.\n“Mr. Scrooge!” said Bob; “I’ll give you Mr. Scrooge, the Founder of the Feast!”\n“The Founder of the Feast indeed!” cried Mrs. Cratchit, reddening. “I wish I had him here. I’d give him a piece of my mind to feast upon, and I hope he’d have a good appetite for it.”\n“My dear,” said Bob, “the children! Christmas Day.”\n“It should be Christmas Day, I am sure,” said she, “on which one drinks the health of such an odious, stingy, hard, unfeeling man as Mr. Scrooge. You know he is, Robert! Nobody knows it better than you do, poor fellow!”\n“My dear,” was Bob’s mild answer, “Christmas Day.”\n“I’ll drink his health for your sake and the Day’s,” said Mrs. Cratchit, “not for his. Long life to him! A merry Christmas and a happy new year! He’ll be very merry and very happy, I have no doubt!”\nThe children drank the toast after her. It was the first of their proceedings which had no heartiness. Tiny Tim drank it last of all, but he didn’t care twopence for it. Scrooge was the Ogre of the family. The mention of his name cast a dark shadow on the party, which was not dispelled for full five minutes.\nAfter it had passed away, they were ten times merrier than before, from the mere relief of Scrooge the Baleful being done with. Bob Cratchit told them how he had a situation in his eye for Master Peter, which would bring in, if obtained, full five-and-sixpence weekly. The two young Cratchits laughed tremendously at the idea of Peter’s being a man of business; and Peter himself looked thoughtfully at the fire from between his collars, as if he were deliberating what particular investments he should favour when he came into the receipt of that bewildering income. Martha, who was a poor apprentice at a milliner’s, then told them what kind of work she had to do, and how many hours she worked at a stretch, and how she meant to lie abed to-morrow morning for a good long rest; to-morrow being a holiday she passed at home. Also how she had seen a countess and a lord some days before, and how the lord “was much about as tall as Peter;” at which Peter pulled up his collars so high that you couldn’t have seen his head if you had been there. All this time the chestnuts and the jug went round and round; and by-and-bye they had a song, about a lost child travelling in the snow, from Tiny Tim, who had a plaintive little voice, and sang it very well indeed.\nThere was nothing of high mark in this. They were not a handsome family; they were not well dressed; their shoes were far from being water-proof; their clothes were scanty; and Peter might have known, and very likely did, the inside of a pawnbroker’s. But, they were happy, grateful, pleased with one another, and contented with the time; and when they faded, and looked happier yet in the bright sprinklings of the Spirit’s torch at parting, Scrooge had his eye upon them, and especially on Tiny Tim, until the last.",

                "refinement_prompt": "IMPROVEMENT GUIDANCE:\n1. MAJOR STRUCTURAL ISSUES:\n- The completion introduces a reflective narrator’s commentary on the Cratchits’ material circumstances and happiness, which is more explicit and interpretive than in the original, shifting the tone from observation to direct reflection.\n- There is a slight invention in the dialogue, with Mrs. Cratchit’s lines altered to include new phrases and sentiments not present in the original, and the Spirit is incorrectly referenced as pronouncing Scrooge’s name, which does not occur in the source passage.\n\n2. MISSING ELEMENTS:\n- The completion omits the specific sequence where Mrs. Cratchit is reminded twice by Bob that it is Christmas Day, which is a key part of the family dynamic and the tension in the scene.\n- The description of the children’s reaction to the toast, including the detail about Tiny Tim’s indifference and the lack of heartiness, is abbreviated and lacks the nuanced progression found in the original.\n- The passage where the mention of Scrooge’s name casts a shadow for a specific duration is condensed, losing the sense of time and emotional impact.\n- The details of Martha’s work, her anticipation of a holiday, and her encounter with nobility are summarized rather than presented in the step-by-step manner of the original.\n- The ongoing actions with the chestnuts and jug circulating are not fully depicted, and the transition to Tiny Tim’s song is less gradual than in the source.\n\n3. INACCURATE ELEMENTS:\n- The completion inaccurately attributes the mention of Scrooge’s name to the Spirit, rather than to Bob Cratchit.\n- The sequence of dialogue is altered, with Mrs. Cratchit’s and Bob’s exchanges reordered and reworded, affecting the flow of the family’s conversation.\n- The amount of Peter’s potential earnings is correct in value but is presented as “five shillings and sixpence” instead of the original phrasing, which may affect the period authenticity.\n- The description of the Cratchits’ material state and happiness is more interpretive and less observational, shifting the tone from the original’s subtlety to overt commentary.\n- The ending introduces a more explicit statement about Scrooge’s focus on Tiny Tim, rather than maintaining the original’s more understated observation."

            "prefix-probing": "Scrooge bent before the Ghost’s rebuke, and trembling cast his eyes upon the ground. The spectral figure, with a voice both stern and sorrowful, spoke of the past, the present, and the future, revealing to Scrooge the consequences of his miserly ways. As the scenes unfolded, Scrooge saw himself as a lonely boy, neglected and yearning for affection, and he felt a pang of regret. The Ghost showed him the joy he had missed in his youth, the warmth of family gatherings, and the kindness he had spurned.\n\nNext, the Spirit led Scrooge through the bustling streets of London, where he witnessed the hardships faced by the poor and the generosity of those who gave despite their own scarcity. Scrooge saw the Cratchit family, humble and loving, struggling to make ends meet but rich in affection. Tiny Tim, the youngest Cratchit child, touched Scrooge’s heart with his frailty and innocence.\n\nFinally, the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come appeared, silent and foreboding, showing Scrooge a future shrouded in darkness. Scrooge saw his own death, unlamented and alone, and the sorrow that would befall the Cratchit family with Tiny Tim’s passing. The vision filled him with dread and a desperate desire to change his ways.\n\nAwakening on Christmas morning, Scrooge was transformed. He embraced the spirit of generosity and kindness, sending a large turkey to the Cratchit household and joining in their celebrations. He became a benefactor to the poor, a friend to the lonely, and a second father to Tiny Tim, whose life was spared through Scrooge’s newfound compassion.\n\nThrough his journey with the three spirits, Scrooge learned that wealth was meaningless without love and charity. His heart, once cold and closed, opened to the joys of human connection and the true meaning of Christmas. The tale of Ebenezer Scrooge stands as a timeless reminder that it is never too late to change and that the spirit of Christmas lives in acts of kindness and goodwill toward all."

          "text_segment": "By this time it was getting dark, and snowing pretty heavily; and as Scrooge and the Spirit went along the streets, the brightness of the roaring fires in kitchens, parlours, and all sorts of rooms, was wonderful. Here, the flickering of the blaze showed preparations for a cosy dinner, with hot plates baking through and through before the fire, and deep red curtains, ready to be drawn to shut out cold and darkness. There all the children of the house were running out into the snow to meet their married sisters, brothers, cousins, uncles, aunts, and be the first to greet them. Here, again, were shadows on the window-blind of guests assembling; and there a group of handsome girls, all hooded and fur-booted, and all chattering at once, tripped lightly off to some near neighbour’s house; where, woe upon the single man who saw them enter—artful witches, well they knew it—in a glow!\nBut, if you had judged from the numbers of people on their way to friendly gatherings, you might have thought that no one was at home to give them welcome when they got there, instead of every house expecting company, and piling up its fires half-chimney high. Blessings on it, how the Ghost exulted! How it bared its breadth of breast, and opened its capacious palm, and floated on, outpouring, with a generous hand, its bright and harmless mirth on everything within its reach! The very lamplighter, who ran on before, dotting the dusky street with specks of light, and who was dressed to spend the evening somewhere, laughed out loudly as the Spirit passed, though little kenned the lamplighter that he had any company but Christmas!\nAnd now, without a word of warning from the Ghost, they stood upon a bleak and desert moor, where monstrous masses of rude stone were cast about, as though it were the burial-place of giants; and water spread itself wheresoever it listed, or would have done so, but for the frost that held it prisoner; and nothing grew but moss and furze, and coarse rank grass. Down in the west the setting sun had left a streak of fiery red, which glared upon the desolation for an instant, like a sullen eye, and frowning lower, lower, lower yet, was lost in the thick gloom of darkest night.\n“What place is this?” asked Scrooge.\n“A place where Miners live, who labour in the bowels of the earth,” returned the Spirit. “But they know me. See!”\nA light shone from the window of a hut, and swiftly they advanced towards it. Passing through the wall of mud and stone, they found a cheerful company assembled round a glowing fire. An old, old man and woman, with their children and their children’s children, and another generation beyond that, all decked out gaily in their holiday attire. The old man, in a voice that seldom rose above the howling of the wind upon the barren waste, was singing them a Christmas song—it had been a very old song when he was a boy—and from time to time they all joined in the chorus. So surely as they raised their voices, the old man got quite blithe and loud; and so surely as they stopped, his vigour sank again.\nThe Spirit did not tarry here, but bade Scrooge hold his robe, and passing on above the moor, sped—whither? Not to sea? To sea. To Scrooge’s horror, looking back, he saw the last of the land, a frightful range of rocks, behind them; and his ears were deafened by the thundering of water, as it rolled and roared, and raged among the dreadful caverns it had worn, and fiercely tried to undermine the earth.\nBuilt upon a dismal reef of sunken rocks, some league or so from shore, on which the waters chafed and dashed, the wild year through, there stood a solitary lighthouse. Great heaps of sea-weed clung to its base, and storm-birds—born of the wind one might suppose, as sea-weed of the water—rose and fell about it, like the waves they skimmed.\nBut even here, two men who watched the light had made a fire, that through the loophole in the thick stone wall shed out a ray of brightness on the awful sea. Joining their horny hands over the rough table at which they sat, they wished each other Merry Christmas in their can of grog; and one of them: the elder, too, with his face all damaged and scarred with hard weather, as the figure-head of an old ship might be: struck up a sturdy song that was like a Gale in itself.\nAgain the Ghost sped on, above the black and heaving sea—on, on—until, being far away, as he told Scrooge, from any shore, they lighted on a ship. They stood beside the helmsman at the wheel, the look-out in the bow, the officers who had the watch; dark, ghostly figures in their several stations; but every man among them hummed a Christmas tune, or had a Christmas thought, or spoke below his breath to his companion of some bygone Christmas Day, with homeward hopes belonging to it. And every man on board, waking or sleeping, good or bad, had had a kinder word for another on that day than on any day in the year; and had shared to some extent in its festivities; and had remembered those he cared for at a distance, and had known that they delighted to remember him.\nIt was a great surprise to Scrooge, while listening to the moaning of the wind, and thinking what a solemn thing it was to move on through the lonely darkness over an unknown abyss, whose depths were secrets as profound as Death: it was a great surprise to Scrooge, while thus engaged, to hear a hearty laugh. It was a much greater surprise to Scrooge to recognise it as his own nephew’s and to find himself in a bright, dry, gleaming room, with the Spirit standing smiling by his side, and looking at that same nephew with approving affability!\n“Ha, ha!” laughed Scrooge’s nephew. “Ha, ha, ha!”\nIf you should happen, by any unlikely chance, to know a man more blest in a laugh than Scrooge’s nephew, all I can say is, I should like to know him too. Introduce him to me, and I’ll cultivate his acquaintance.\nIt is a fair, even-handed, noble adjustment of things, that while there is infection in disease and sorrow, there is nothing in the world so irresistibly contagious as laughter and good-humour. When Scrooge’s nephew laughed in this way: holding his sides, rolling his head, and twisting his face into the most extravagant contortions: Scrooge’s niece, by marriage, laughed as heartily as he. And their assembled friends being not a bit behindhand, roared out lustily.\n“Ha, ha! Ha, ha, ha, ha!”\n“He said that Christmas was a humbug, as I live!” cried Scrooge’s nephew. “He believed it too!”\n“More shame for him, Fred!” said Scrooge’s niece, indignantly. Bless those women; they never do anything by halves. They are always in earnest.\nShe was very pretty: exceedingly pretty. With a dimpled, surprised-looking, capital face; a ripe little mouth, that seemed made to be kissed—as no doubt it was; all kinds of good little dots about her chin, that melted into one another when she laughed; and the sunniest pair of eyes you ever saw in any little creature’s head. Altogether she was what you would have called provoking, you know; but satisfactory, too. Oh, perfectly satisfactory.\n“He’s a comical old fellow,” said Scrooge’s nephew, “that’s the truth: and not so pleasant as he might be. However, his offences carry their own punishment, and I have nothing to say against him.”\n“I’m sure he is very rich, Fred,” hinted Scrooge’s niece. “At least you always tell me so.”\n“What of that, my dear!” said Scrooge’s nephew. “His wealth is of no use to him. He don’t do any good with it. He don’t make himself comfortable with it. He hasn’t the satisfaction of thinking—ha, ha, ha!—that he is ever going to benefit US with it.”\n“I have no patience with him,” observed Scrooge’s niece. Scrooge’s niece’s sisters, and all the other ladies, expressed the same opinion.\n“Oh, I have!” said Scrooge’s nephew. “I am sorry for him; I couldn’t be angry with him if I tried. Who suffers by his ill whims! Himself, always. Here, he takes it into his head to dislike us, and he won’t come and dine with us. What’s the consequence? He don’t lose much of a dinner.”\n“Indeed, I think he loses a very good dinner,” interrupted Scrooge’s niece. Everybody else said the same, and they must be allowed to have been competent judges, because they had just had dinner; and, with the dessert upon the table, were clustered round the fire, by lamplight.\n“Well! I’m very glad to hear it,” said Scrooge’s nephew, “because I haven’t great faith in these young housekeepers. What do you say, Topper?”\nTopper had clearly got his eye upon one of Scrooge’s niece’s sisters, for he answered that a bachelor was a wretched outcast, who had no right to express an opinion on the subject. Whereat Scrooge’s niece’s sister—the plump one with the lace tucker: not the one with the roses—blushed.\n“Do go on, Fred,” said Scrooge’s niece, clapping her hands. “He never finishes what he begins to say! He is such a ridiculous fellow!”\nScrooge’s nephew revelled in another laugh, and as it was impossible to keep the infection off; though the plump sister tried hard to do it with aromatic vinegar; his example was unanimously followed.\n“I was only going to say,” said Scrooge’s nephew, “that the consequence of his taking a dislike to us, and not making merry with us, is, as I think, that he loses some pleasant moments, which could do him no harm. I am sure he loses pleasanter companions than he can find in his own thoughts, either in his mouldy old office, or his dusty chambers. I mean to give him the same chance every year, whether he likes it or not, for I pity him. He may rail at Christmas till he dies, but he can’t help thinking better of it—I defy him—if he finds me going there, in good temper, year after year, and saying Uncle Scrooge, how are you? If it only puts him in the vein to leave his poor clerk fifty pounds, that’s something; and I think I shook him yesterday.”\nIt was their turn to laugh now at the notion of his shaking Scrooge. But being thoroughly good-natured, and not much caring what they laughed at, so that they laughed at any rate, he encouraged them in their merriment, and passed the bottle joyously.\nAfter tea, they had some music. For they were a musical family, and knew what they were about, when they sung a Glee or Catch, I can assure you: especially Topper, who could growl away in the bass like a good one, and never swell the large veins in his forehead, or get red in the face over it. Scrooge’s niece played well upon the harp; and played among other tunes a simple little air (a mere nothing: you might learn to whistle it in two minutes), which had been familiar to the child who fetched Scrooge from the boarding-school, as he had been reminded by the Ghost of Christmas Past. When this strain of music sounded, all the things that Ghost had shown him, came upon his mind; he softened more and more; and thought that if he could have listened to it often, years ago, he might have cultivated the kindnesses of life for his own happiness with his own hands, without resorting to the sexton’s spade that buried Jacob Marley.\nBut they didn’t devote the whole evening to music. After a while they played at forfeits; for it is good to be children sometimes, and never better than at Christmas, when its mighty Founder was a child himself. Stop! There was first a game at blind-man’s buff. Of course there was. And I no more believe Topper was really blind than I believe he had eyes in his boots. My opinion is, that it was a done thing between him and Scrooge’s nephew; and that the Ghost of Christmas Present knew it. The way he went after that plump sister in the lace tucker, was an outrage on the credulity of human nature. Knocking down the fire-irons, tumbling over the chairs, bumping against the piano, smothering himself among the curtains, wherever she went, there went he! He always knew where the plump sister was. He wouldn’t catch anybody else. If you had fallen up against him (as some of them did), on purpose, he would have made a feint of endeavouring to seize you, which would have been an affront to your understanding, and would instantly have sidled off in the direction of the plump sister. She often cried out that it wasn’t fair; and it really was not. But when at last, he caught her; when, in spite of all her silken rustlings, and her rapid flutterings past him, he got her into a corner whence there was no escape; then his conduct was the most execrable. For his pretending not to know her; his pretending that it was necessary to touch her head-dress, and further to assure himself of her identity by pressing a certain ring upon her finger, and a certain chain about her neck; was vile, monstrous! No doubt she told him her opinion of it, when, another blind-man being in office, they were so very confidential together, behind the curtains.\nScrooge’s niece was not one of the blind-man’s buff party, but was made comfortable with a large chair and a footstool, in a snug corner, where the Ghost and Scrooge were close behind her. But she joined in the forfeits, and loved her love to admiration with all the letters of the alphabet. Likewise at the game of How, When, and Where, she was very great, and to the secret joy of Scrooge’s nephew, beat her sisters hollow: though they were sharp girls too, as Topper could have told you. There might have been twenty people there, young and old, but they all played, and so did Scrooge; for wholly forgetting in the interest he had in what was going on, that his voice made no sound in their ears, he sometimes came out with his guess quite loud, and very often guessed quite right, too; for the sharpest needle, best Whitechapel, warranted not to cut in the eye, was not sharper than Scrooge; blunt as he took it in his head to be.\nThe Ghost was greatly pleased to find him in this mood, and looked upon him with such favour, that he begged like a boy to be allowed to stay until the guests departed. But this the Spirit said could not be done.\n“Here is a new game,” said Scrooge. “One half hour, Spirit, only one!”\nIt was a Game called Yes and No, where Scrooge’s nephew had to think of something, and the rest must find out what; he only answering to their questions yes or no, as the case was. The brisk fire of questioning to which he was exposed, elicited from him that he was thinking of an animal, a live animal, rather a disagreeable animal, a savage animal, an animal that growled and grunted sometimes, and talked sometimes, and lived in London, and walked about the streets, and wasn’t made a show of, and wasn’t led by anybody, and didn’t live in a menagerie, and was never killed in a market, and was not a horse, or an ass, or a cow, or a bull, or a tiger, or a dog, or a pig, or a cat, or a bear. At every fresh question that was put to him, this nephew burst into a fresh roar of laughter; and was so inexpressibly tickled, that he was obliged to get up off the sofa and stamp. At last the plump sister, falling into a similar state, cried out:\n“I have found it out! I know what it is, Fred! I know what it is!”\n“What is it?” cried Fred.\n“It’s your Uncle Scro-o-o-o-oge!”\nWhich it certainly was. Admiration was the universal sentiment, though some objected that the reply to “Is it a bear?” ought to have been “Yes;” inasmuch as an answer in the negative was sufficient to have diverted their thoughts from Mr. Scrooge, supposing they had ever had any tendency that way.",

            "prefix-probing": "The crisp air was filled with the scent of burning wood and the cheerful sounds of families gathering together. Scrooge, who had been so cold and miserly in his ways, found himself strangely moved by the warmth and joy that seemed to radiate from every home. The Spirit, with a gentle smile, guided him onward, showing him scenes of happiness and kindness that he had long ignored.\n\nThey passed by a humble cottage where a family sat around a modest table, sharing a simple meal but laughing and singing with genuine delight. The children’s eyes sparkled with innocence and hope, and the parents’ faces were alight with love and contentment. Scrooge felt a pang in his heart, a feeling he had not known for many years.\n\nFurther along, they came upon a bustling market where vendors sold their wares, and strangers greeted each other with warmth and goodwill. The Spirit pointed out a man giving a loaf of bread to a beggar, and a woman wrapping a threadbare child in a warm shawl. These acts of kindness, small yet profound, painted a picture of humanity at its best.\n\nAs they continued their journey, the snow fell thicker, blanketing the city in a soft white cover that muffled the sounds and made the world seem peaceful and new. Scrooge’s thoughts turned inward, reflecting on his own life and the choices he had made. He saw the loneliness that his greed had wrought, the missed opportunities for friendship and love.\n\nThe Spirit led him to a window where a young couple sat by the fire, their faces glowing with hope and anticipation. They spoke of dreams and plans for the future, of building a life together filled with happiness and mutual support. Scrooge felt a warmth in his chest, a yearning to be part of such joy.\n\nSuddenly, the scene shifted, and they found themselves in a bustling office where Scrooge himself once worked. He saw his younger self, full of ambition but also kindness, offering help to a struggling clerk named Bob Cratchit. The Spirit’s presence seemed to breathe life into the memory, and Scrooge watched with a mixture of pride and regret.\n\nBob Cratchit, despite his meager means, was surrounded by a loving family. The Spirit showed Scrooge the Cratchits’ humble Christmas celebration, where laughter and love filled the small room. Tiny Tim, the youngest son, was frail but full of spirit, and his smile touched Scrooge deeply.\n\nMoved by the sight, Scrooge felt tears welling in his eyes. He realized that wealth and possessions were meaningless without compassion and connection. The Spirit’s voice was gentle as it spoke, \"These are the things that make life rich, Ebenezer. Remember them well.\"\n\nThe night grew late, and the snow continued to fall, but Scrooge’s heart was lighter than it had been in years. He knew that the journey was far from over, but for the first time, he felt hope. Hope that he could change, that he could make amends, and that he could embrace the true spirit of Christmas.\n\nAs the Spirit prepared to lead him onward, Scrooge took a deep breath and whispered, \"Thank you. I am ready to see more, to learn more, and to become more.\"\n\nThe Spirit nodded, and together they vanished into the snowy night, ready to uncover the lessons that awaited them in the days to come."

Here is a glass of mulled wine ready to our hand at the moment; and I say, ‘Uncle Scrooge!’ ”\n“Well! Uncle Scrooge!” they cried.\n“A Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year to the old man, whatever he is!” said Scrooge’s nephew. “He wouldn’t take it from me, but may he have it, nevertheless. Uncle Scrooge!”\nUncle Scrooge had imperceptibly become so gay and light of heart, that he would have pledged the unconscious company in return, and thanked them in an inaudible speech, if the Ghost had given him time. But the whole scene passed off in the breath of the last word spoken by his nephew; and he and the Spirit were again upon their travels.\nMuch they saw, and far they went, and many homes they visited, but always with a happy end. The Spirit stood beside sick beds, and they were cheerful; on foreign lands, and they were close at home; by struggling men, and they were patient in their greater hope; by poverty, and it was rich. In almshouse, hospital, and jail, in misery’s every refuge, where vain man in his little brief authority had not made fast the door, and barred the Spirit out, he left his blessing, and taught Scrooge his precepts.\nIt was a long night, if it were only a night; but Scrooge had his doubts of this, because the Christmas Holidays appeared to be condensed into the space of time they passed together. It was strange, too, that while Scrooge remained unaltered in his outward form, the Ghost grew older, clearly older. Scrooge had observed this change, but never spoke of it, until they left a children’s Twelfth Night party, when, looking at the Spirit as they stood together in an open place, he noticed that its hair was grey.\n“Are spirits’ lives so short?” asked Scrooge.\n“My life upon this globe, is very brief,” replied the Ghost. “It ends to-night.”\n“To-night!” cried Scrooge.\n“To-night at midnight. Hark! The time is drawing near.”\nThe chimes were ringing the three quarters past eleven at that moment.\n“Forgive me if I am not justified in what I ask,” said Scrooge, looking intently at the Spirit’s robe, “but I see something strange, and not belonging to yourself, protruding from your skirts. Is it a foot or a claw?”\n“It might be a claw, for the flesh there is upon it,” was the Spirit’s sorrowful reply. “Look here.”\nFrom the foldings of its robe, it brought two children; wretched, abject, frightful, hideous, miserable. They knelt down at its feet, and clung upon the outside of its garment.\n“Oh, Man! look here. Look, look, down here!” exclaimed the Ghost.\nThey were a boy and girl. Yellow, meagre, ragged, scowling, wolfish; but prostrate, too, in their humility. Where graceful youth should have filled their features out, and touched them with its freshest tints, a stale and shrivelled hand, like that of age, had pinched, and twisted them, and pulled them into shreds. Where angels might have sat enthroned, devils lurked, and glared out menacing. No change, no degradation, no perversion of humanity, in any grade, through all the mysteries of wonderful creation, has monsters half so horrible and dread.\nScrooge started back, appalled. Having them shown to him in this way, he tried to say they were fine children, but the words choked themselves, rather than be parties to a lie of such enormous magnitude.\n“Spirit! are they yours?” Scrooge could say no more.\n“They are Man’s,” said the Spirit, looking down upon them. “And they cling to me, appealing from their fathers. This boy is Ignorance. This girl is Want. Beware them both, and all of their degree, but most of all beware this boy, for on his brow I see that written which is Doom, unless the writing be erased. Deny it!” cried the Spirit, stretching out its hand towards the city. “Slander those who tell it ye! Admit it for your factious purposes, and make it worse. And bide the end!”\n“Have they no refuge or resource?” cried Scrooge.\n“Are there no prisons?” said the Spirit, turning on him for the last time with his own words. “Are there no workhouses?”\nThe bell struck twelve.\nScrooge looked about him for the Ghost, and saw it not. As the last stroke ceased to vibrate, he remembered the prediction of old Jacob Marley, and lifting up his eyes, beheld a solemn Phantom, draped and hooded, coming, like a mist along the ground, towards him.",

Scrooge, however, sat apart, his brow furrowed and his eyes distant, as if the merriment around him was but a faint echo in a world he no longer wished to partake in.\n\nFred, noticing his uncle’s somber demeanor, rose from his chair and approached him with a gentle smile. “Uncle, you must join us. There is no better time than Christmas to share in the joy and goodwill that binds us all.”\n\nScrooge looked up, his gaze softening for a moment. “I am not so sure, Fred. Christmas has always been a time of loss and regret for me. I find little comfort in its celebrations.”\n\n“Nonsense,” Fred replied warmly. “Christmas is a time for forgiveness, for hope, and for new beginnings. It is never too late to change, to open one’s heart to kindness and generosity.”\n\nAs the evening wore on, the spirit of Christmas seemed to seep into Scrooge’s very being. The laughter, the songs, and the stories shared by those around him stirred memories long buried beneath layers of bitterness and solitude.\n\nLater that night, as Scrooge lay in his bed, the room grew cold and dark. Suddenly, a faint light appeared, growing brighter until it revealed the ghostly figure of his former partner, Jacob Marley. Bound in chains and weighed down by heavy locks, Marley’s visage was one of sorrow and warning.\n\n“Scrooge,” Marley intoned, “you have yet a chance and hope of escaping my fate. Tonight, you will be visited by three spirits. Heed their lessons, and you may yet find redemption.”\n\nWith that, Marley vanished, leaving Scrooge trembling and alone.\n\nThe first spirit, the Ghost of Christmas Past, appeared as a gentle light, guiding Scrooge through scenes of his own history. He saw himself as a lonely boy, neglected and yearning for affection; a young man, full of promise but slowly succumbing to greed and ambition; and moments of joy and sorrow that had shaped the man he had become.\n\nNext came the Ghost of Christmas Present, a jolly giant clad in green, who showed Scrooge the warmth and happiness of those celebrating the holiday. Scrooge witnessed the humble Cratchit family, whose love and resilience in the face of hardship touched his heart deeply, especially the frail and kind-hearted Tiny Tim.\n\nFinally, the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come appeared, a silent and foreboding figure cloaked in darkness. It revealed to Scrooge a future marked by loneliness, regret, and death, with no one to mourn his passing.\n\nAwakening with a start, Scrooge was filled with a newfound resolve. He rose from his bed, eager to embrace the spirit of Christmas and to make amends for his past misdeeds.\n\nHe began by sending a generous donation to the Cratchit family, ensuring they would have a joyful holiday. Then, he joined Fred’s celebration, his laughter ringing out with genuine warmth and happiness.\n\nFrom that day forward, Scrooge became a man transformed. He was kind, generous, and full of the Christmas spirit, touching the lives of all who knew him. And Tiny Tim, buoyed by Scrooge’s newfound generosity, grew strong and well, a living testament to the power of compassion and redemption.\n\nThus, the tale of Ebenezer Scrooge serves as a timeless reminder that it is never too late to change, to open one’s heart, and to embrace the true meaning of Christmas."

When it came near him, Scrooge bent down upon his knee; for in the very air through which this Spirit moved it seemed to scatter gloom and mystery.\nIt was shrouded in a deep black garment, which concealed its head, its face, its form, and left nothing of it visible save one outstretched hand. But for this it would have been difficult to detach its figure from the night, and separate it from the darkness by which it was surrounded.\nHe felt that it was tall and stately when it came beside him, and that its mysterious presence filled him with a solemn dread. He knew no more, for the Spirit neither spoke nor moved.\n“I am in the presence of the Ghost of Christmas Yet To Come?” said Scrooge.\nThe Spirit answered not, but pointed onward with its hand.\n“You are about to show me shadows of the things that have not happened, but will happen in the time before us,” Scrooge pursued. “Is that so, Spirit?”\nThe upper portion of the garment was contracted for an instant in its folds, as if the Spirit had inclined its head. That was the only answer he received.\nAlthough well used to ghostly company by this time, Scrooge feared the silent shape so much that his legs trembled beneath him, and he found that he could hardly stand when he prepared to follow it. The Spirit paused a moment, as observing his condition, and giving him time to recover.\nBut Scrooge was all the worse for this. It thrilled him with a vague uncertain horror, to know that behind the dusky shroud, there were ghostly eyes intently fixed upon him, while he, though he stretched his own to the utmost, could see nothing but a spectral hand and one great heap of black.\n“Ghost of the Future!” he exclaimed, “I fear you more than any spectre I have seen. But as I know your purpose is to do me good, and as I hope to live to be another man from what I was, I am prepared to bear you company, and do it with a thankful heart. Will you not speak to me?”\nIt gave him no reply. The hand was pointed straight before them.\n“Lead on!” said Scrooge. “Lead on! The night is waning fast, and it is precious time to me, I know. Lead on, Spirit!”\nThe Phantom moved away as it had come towards him. Scrooge followed in the shadow of its dress, which bore him up, he thought, and carried him along.",

The figure was shrouded in a deep, dark cloak, its face obscured by a hood that cast a shadow over its features. Yet, there was an undeniable presence about the apparition, a solemnity that commanded attention.\n\n\"Who are you?\" Scrooge asked, his voice trembling.\n\n\"I am the Ghost of Christmas Past,\" the Phantom replied, its voice echoing softly through the chamber.\n\nScrooge's heart pounded as the spirit extended a hand toward him. \"Come,\" it beckoned, \"we have much to see.\"\n\nWithout hesitation, Scrooge grasped the spectral hand, and in an instant, they were transported to a scene from long ago. The cold, dark room faded away, replaced by the warm glow of a festive gathering. Scrooge saw himself as a young boy, laughing and playing with his sister, surrounded by love and joy.\n\nTears welled in Scrooge's eyes as memories flooded back—moments of happiness he had long buried beneath layers of greed and bitterness. The Ghost of Christmas Past guided him through scenes of his youth: his apprenticeship under the kindly Mr. Fezziwig, the tender courtship with Belle, and the gradual erosion of his capacity for love as he became consumed by wealth.\n\nEach vision was a lesson, a reminder of the man he once was and the man he had become. The spirit's presence was both comforting and unsettling, illuminating the path that had led Scrooge to his current state.\n\nAs the final scene faded, the Phantom turned to Scrooge. \"Remember these moments, for they hold the key to your redemption.\"\n\nBefore Scrooge could respond, the spirit vanished, leaving him alone in the dimly lit room. The weight of the journey pressed upon him, stirring a newfound resolve to change.\n\nNo sooner had the Ghost of Christmas Past departed than another figure appeared—a towering, radiant being embodying the present moment. \"I am the Ghost of Christmas Present,\" it declared, its voice booming with warmth and vitality.\n\nTogether, they ventured into the bustling streets, witnessing the joy and generosity that filled the air. Scrooge saw families gathered around tables laden with food, children playing in the snow, and neighbors sharing laughter and goodwill.\n\nThe spirit revealed to Scrooge the struggles of those less fortunate, including the Cratchit family, whose humble celebration was marked by love despite hardship. Tiny Tim, frail yet spirited, captured Scrooge's heart, embodying the innocence and hope that Christmas inspired.\n\nMoved by these visions, Scrooge felt a stirring within—a desire to embrace compassion and kindness. The Ghost of Christmas Present's presence was a beacon, illuminating the impact of generosity and the true spirit of the season.\n\nAs the night wore on, the final spirit awaited—the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come, a silent, foreboding figure cloaked in darkness. Its presence was chilling, a stark reminder of the consequences of Scrooge's choices.\n\nThrough the visions of the future, Scrooge confronted the grim fate that awaited him if he continued on his current path: loneliness, regret, and a death un-mourned. The specter also revealed the potential for change, a future where Scrooge embraced kindness and was remembered with love.\n\nAwakening from his spectral journey, Scrooge found himself transformed. The coldness in his heart thawed, replaced by warmth and generosity. He vowed to live with compassion, to cherish those around him, and to embody the true spirit of Christmas.\n\nFrom that day forward, Ebenezer Scrooge became a man reborn, his life a testament to the power of redemption and the enduring magic of Christmas."

Observing that the hand was pointed to them, Scrooge advanced to listen to their talk.\n“No,” said a great fat man with a monstrous chin, “I don’t know much about it, either way. I only know he’s dead.”\n“When did he die?” inquired another.\n“Last night, I believe.”\n“Why, what was the matter with him?” asked a third, taking a vast quantity of snuff out of a very large snuff-box. “I thought he’d never die.”\n“God knows,” said the first, with a yawn.\n“What has he done with his money?” asked a red-faced gentleman with a pendulous excrescence on the end of his nose, that shook like the gills of a turkey-cock.\n“I haven’t heard,” said the man with the large chin, yawning again. “Left it to his company, perhaps. He hasn’t left it to me. That’s all I know.”\nThis pleasantry was received with a general laugh.\n“It’s likely to be a very cheap funeral,” said the same speaker; “for upon my life I don’t know of anybody to go to it. Suppose we make up a party and volunteer?”\n“I don’t mind going if a lunch is provided,” observed the gentleman with the excrescence on his nose. “But I must be fed, if I make one.”\nAnother laugh.\n“Well, I am the most disinterested among you, after all,” said the first speaker, “for I never wear black gloves, and I never eat lunch. But I’ll offer to go, if anybody else will. When I come to think of it, I’m not at all sure that I wasn’t his most particular friend; for we used to stop and speak whenever we met. Bye, bye!”\nSpeakers and listeners strolled away, and mixed with other groups. Scrooge knew the men, and looked towards the Spirit for an explanation.\nThe Phantom glided on into a street. Its finger pointed to two persons meeting. Scrooge listened again, thinking that the explanation might lie here.\nHe knew these men, also, perfectly. They were men of business: very wealthy, and of great importance. He had made a point always of standing well in their esteem: in a business point of view, that is; strictly in a business point of view.\n“How are you?” said one.\n“How are you?” returned the other.\n“Well!” said the first. “Old Scratch has got his own at last, hey?”\n“So I am told,” returned the second. “Cold, isn’t it?”\n“Seasonable for Christmas time. You’re not a skater, I suppose?”\n“No. No. Something else to think of. Good morning!”\nNot another word. That was their meeting, their conversation, and their parting.\nScrooge was at first inclined to be surprised that the Spirit should attach importance to conversations apparently so trivial; but feeling assured that they must have some hidden purpose, he set himself to consider what it was likely to be. They could scarcely be supposed to have any bearing on the death of Jacob, his old partner, for that was Past, and this Ghost’s province was the Future. Nor could he think of any one immediately connected with himself, to whom he could apply them. But nothing doubting that to whomsoever they applied they had some latent moral for his own improvement, he resolved to treasure up every word he heard, and everything he saw; and especially to observe the shadow of himself when it appeared. For he had an expectation that the conduct of his future self would give him the clue he missed, and would render the solution of these riddles easy.\nHe looked about in that very place for his own image; but another man stood in his accustomed corner, and though the clock pointed to his usual time of day for being there, he saw no likeness of himself among the multitudes that poured in through the Porch. It gave him little surprise, however; for he had been revolving in his mind a change of life, and thought and hoped he saw his new-born resolutions carried out in this.\nQuiet and dark, beside him stood the Phantom, with its outstretched hand. When he roused himself from his thoughtful quest, he fancied from the turn of the hand, and its situation in reference to himself, that the Unseen Eyes were looking at him keenly. It made him shudder, and feel very cold.",

            "prefix-probing": "They scarcely seemed to enter the city; for the city rather seemed to spring up about them, and encompass them of its own act. The fog and darkness thickened so, that people ran before it as if it were a mighty wind. The houses opposite were mere phantoms, and the shops and their windows looked like a series of gaunt and spectral faces, peering out from the gloom. Yet, in the midst of this spectral scene, there was a warmth and cheerfulness that could not be denied. The streets were alive with the bustle of Christmas Eve, and the air was filled with the sound of laughter and the scent of roasting chestnuts.\n\nScrooge and his companion, the Ghost of Christmas Present, moved through the city with a sense of purpose. The spirit, a jolly giant clad in a green robe bordered with white fur, bore a torch that shed a bright and genial light upon the scenes below. As they passed, the spirit pointed out the various sights and sounds of the season: the joyous carolers singing in the streets, the families gathered around their hearths, and the children playing in the snow.\n\nThey came upon a humble dwelling, where a family was gathered around a small fire. The room was scantily furnished, but the faces of the occupants shone with happiness and contentment. The father, a kind-faced man, was carving a joint of meat, while the mother tended to the children, who were eagerly awaiting their Christmas feast. The spirit explained to Scrooge that this was the home of Bob Cratchit, Scrooge's underpaid and overworked clerk.\n\nScrooge watched with a mixture of emotions as the Cratchit family celebrated their modest Christmas. Tiny Tim, the youngest child, sat in a little crutch, his face bright with hope despite his frailty. The spirit's voice softened as he spoke of the boy's future, hinting at the possibility of a better fate if kindness and generosity were to prevail.\n\nAs the night wore on, the spirit took Scrooge to various scenes of Christmas cheer and hardship. They visited the homes of the poor and the rich alike, witnessing the universal joy that the season brought. Scrooge saw the warmth of human kindness, the bonds of family and friendship, and the spirit of giving that transcended social class.\n\nAt one point, they came upon a group of miners, who were celebrating their Christmas underground. Despite the darkness and the harshness of their work, their spirits were high, and their songs echoed through the tunnels. The spirit explained that Christmas was a time when even the hardest of hearts could be softened, and the most difficult of circumstances could be brightened by hope and goodwill.\n\nLater, they visited a lighthouse, where the keeper and his family were celebrating the holiday with simple pleasures. The spirit emphasized that Christmas was not about wealth or grandeur, but about the warmth of human connection and the joy of shared moments.\n\nThroughout their journey, Scrooge's heart began to thaw. The coldness and bitterness that had defined his life started to give way to feelings of compassion and understanding. He saw the consequences of his own actions and the impact they had on those around him.\n\nAs dawn approached, the spirit led Scrooge back to his own bedchamber. The city was waking up, and the first light of Christmas Day was breaking through the fog. The spirit's form began to fade, but not before imparting a final message: that the future was not fixed, and that change was possible for those willing to embrace it.\n\nScrooge awoke with a start, the events of the night vivid in his mind. He felt a newfound resolve to alter his ways and to embrace the spirit of Christmas in his heart. With a joyful heart, he set about making amends and spreading kindness to those he had once neglected.\n\nFrom that day forward, Ebenezer Scrooge became a man transformed. He was generous and warm, beloved by all who knew him. The city, once cold and unwelcoming, seemed to shine brighter with his newfound light. And Tiny Tim, whose fate had once seemed so uncertain, grew strong and healthy, a testament to the power of compassion and the true meaning of Christmas."

          "text_segment": "They left the busy scene, and went into an obscure part of the town, where Scrooge had never penetrated before, although he recognised its situation, and its bad repute. The ways were foul and narrow; the shops and houses wretched; the people half-naked, drunken, slipshod, ugly. Alleys and archways, like so many cesspools, disgorged their offences of smell, and dirt, and life, upon the straggling streets; and the whole quarter reeked with crime, with filth, and misery.\nFar in this den of infamous resort, there was a low-browed, beetling shop, below a pent-house roof, where iron, old rags, bottles, bones, and greasy offal, were bought. Upon the floor within, were piled up heaps of rusty keys, nails, chains, hinges, files, scales, weights, and refuse iron of all kinds. Secrets that few would like to scrutinise were bred and hidden in mountains of unseemly rags, masses of corrupted fat, and sepulchres of bones. Sitting in among the wares he dealt in, by a charcoal stove, made of old bricks, was a grey-haired rascal, nearly seventy years of age; who had screened himself from the cold air without, by a frousy curtaining of miscellaneous tatters, hung upon a line; and smoked his pipe in all the luxury of calm retirement.\nScrooge and the Phantom came into the presence of this man, just as a woman with a heavy bundle slunk into the shop. But she had scarcely entered, when another woman, similarly laden, came in too; and she was closely followed by a man in faded black, who was no less startled by the sight of them, than they had been upon the recognition of each other. After a short period of blank astonishment, in which the old man with the pipe had joined them, they all three burst into a laugh.\n“Let the charwoman alone to be the first!” cried she who had entered first. “Let the laundress alone to be the second; and let the undertaker’s man alone to be the third. Look here, old Joe, here’s a chance! If we haven’t all three met here without meaning it!”\n“You couldn’t have met in a better place,” said old Joe, removing his pipe from his mouth. “Come into the parlour. You were made free of it long ago, you know; and the other two an’t strangers. Stop till I shut the door of the shop. Ah! How it skreeks! There an’t such a rusty bit of metal in the place as its own hinges, I believe; and I’m sure there’s no such old bones here, as mine. Ha, ha! We’re all suitable to our calling, we’re well matched. Come into the parlour. Come into the parlour.”\nThe parlour was the space behind the screen of rags. The old man raked the fire together with an old stair-rod, and having trimmed his smoky lamp (for it was night), with the stem of his pipe, put it in his mouth again.\nWhile he did this, the woman who had already spoken threw her bundle on the floor, and sat down in a flaunting manner on a stool; crossing her elbows on her knees, and looking with a bold defiance at the other two.\n“What odds then! What odds, Mrs. Dilber?” said the woman. “Every person has a right to take care of themselves. He always did.”\n“That’s true, indeed!” said the laundress. “No man more so.”\n“Why then, don’t stand staring as if you was afraid, woman; who’s the wiser? We’re not going to pick holes in each other’s coats, I suppose?”\n“No, indeed!” said Mrs. Dilber and the man together. “We should hope not.”\n“Very well, then!” cried the woman. “That’s enough. Who’s the worse for the loss of a few things like these? Not a dead man, I suppose.”\n“No, indeed,” said Mrs. Dilber, laughing.\n“If he wanted to keep ’em after he was dead, a wicked old screw,” pursued the woman, “why wasn’t he natural in his lifetime? If he had been, he’d have had somebody to look after him when he was struck with Death, instead of lying gasping out his last there, alone by himself.”\n“It’s the truest word that ever was spoke,” said Mrs. Dilber. “It’s a judgment on him.”\n“I wish it was a little heavier judgment,” replied the woman; “and it should have been, you may depend upon it, if I could have laid my hands on anything else. Open that bundle, old Joe, and let me know the value of it. Speak out plain. I’m not afraid to be the first, nor afraid for them to see it. We know pretty well that we were helping ourselves, before we met here, I believe. It’s no sin. Open the bundle, Joe.”\nBut the gallantry of her friends would not allow of this; and the man in faded black, mounting the breach first, produced his plunder. It was not extensive. A seal or two, a pencil-case, a pair of sleeve-buttons, and a brooch of no great value, were all. They were severally examined and appraised by old Joe, who chalked the sums he was disposed to give for each, upon the wall, and added them up into a total when he found there was nothing more to come.\n“That’s your account,” said Joe, “and I wouldn’t give another sixpence, if I was to be boiled for not doing it. Who’s next?”\nMrs. Dilber was next. Sheets and towels, a little wearing apparel, two old-fashioned silver teaspoons, a pair of sugar-tongs, and a few boots. Her account was stated on the wall in the same manner.\n“I always give too much to ladies. It’s a weakness of mine, and that’s the way I ruin myself,” said old Joe. “That’s your account. If you asked me for another penny, and made it an open question, I’d repent of being so liberal and knock off half-a-crown.”\n“And now undo my bundle, Joe,” said the first woman.\nJoe went down on his knees for the greater convenience of opening it, and having unfastened a great many knots, dragged out a large and heavy roll of some dark stuff.\n“What do you call this?” said Joe. “Bed-curtains!”\n“Ah!” returned the woman, laughing and leaning forward on her crossed arms. “Bed-curtains!”\n“You don’t mean to say you took ’em down, rings and all, with him lying there?” said Joe.\n“Yes I do,” replied the woman. “Why not?”\n“You were born to make your fortune,” said Joe, “and you’ll certainly do it.”\n“I certainly shan’t hold my hand, when I can get anything in it by reaching it out, for the sake of such a man as He was, I promise you, Joe,” returned the woman coolly. “Don’t drop that oil upon the blankets, now.”\n“His blankets?” asked Joe.\n“Whose else’s do you think?” replied the woman. “He isn’t likely to take cold without ’em, I dare say.”\n“I hope he didn’t die of anything catching? Eh?” said old Joe, stopping in his work, and looking up.\n“Don’t you be afraid of that,” returned the woman. “I an’t so fond of his company that I’d loiter about him for such things, if he did. Ah! you may look through that shirt till your eyes ache; but you won’t find a hole in it, nor a threadbare place. It’s the best he had, and a fine one too. They’d have wasted it, if it hadn’t been for me.”\n“What do you call wasting of it?” asked old Joe.\n“Putting it on him to be buried in, to be sure,” replied the woman with a laugh. “Somebody was fool enough to do it, but I took it off again. If calico an’t good enough for such a purpose, it isn’t good enough for anything. It’s quite as becoming to the body. He can’t look uglier than he did in that one.”\nScrooge listened to this dialogue in horror. As they sat grouped about their spoil, in the scanty light afforded by the old man’s lamp, he viewed them with a detestation and disgust, which could hardly have been greater, though they had been obscene demons, marketing the corpse itself.\n“Ha, ha!” laughed the same woman, when old Joe, producing a flannel bag with money in it, told out their several gains upon the ground. “This is the end of it, you see! He frightened every one away from him when he was alive, to profit us when he was dead! Ha, ha, ha!”\n“Spirit!” said Scrooge, shuddering from head to foot. “I see, I see. The case of this unhappy man might be my own. My life tends that way, now. Merciful Heaven, what is this!”\n",

The streets were narrow and dirty, the houses were old and dilapidated, and the air was thick with the smell of smoke and poverty. As they walked, the Spirit pointed out the homes of those who were suffering, the children who were hungry, and the families who were struggling to survive.\n\nScrooge's heart began to soften as he saw the harsh realities of life for the less fortunate. He saw a little girl shivering in the cold, wrapped in rags, and he felt a pang of guilt for his own selfishness. The Spirit led him to a small, humble dwelling where a family was gathered around a meager fire, sharing what little food they had. Despite their hardships, their faces were filled with love and warmth.\n\nThe Spirit then showed Scrooge the Cratchit household, where Bob Cratchit and his family were celebrating Christmas with joy and gratitude, even though their means were modest. Tiny Tim, the youngest Cratchit child, was frail and weak, but his spirit was strong. Scrooge was deeply moved by the love and resilience of the Cratchit family.\n\nAs the night progressed, the Spirit took Scrooge to various scenes of Christmas celebrations, both joyous and sorrowful. He saw the loneliness of those who had no one to share the holiday with, the generosity of strangers who gave what little they had, and the hope that Christmas brought to all.\n\nFinally, the Spirit showed Scrooge a vision of his own future, a lonely and unloved man whose death would bring no sorrow. Scrooge was horrified by the prospect and begged the Spirit for a chance to change his ways.\n\nWhen Scrooge awoke on Christmas morning, he was transformed. He was filled with joy and generosity, eager to make amends for his past behavior. He sent a large turkey to the Cratchit household, gave a generous donation to charity, and spent the day spreading kindness and cheer.\n\nFrom that day forward, Scrooge became a beloved member of the community, known for his compassion and generosity. He took Tiny Tim under his wing, ensuring that the boy received the care he needed to thrive. The spirit of Christmas lived in Scrooge's heart all year round, and he never forgot the lessons he had learned from the three spirits."

A pale light, rising in the outer air, fell straight upon the bed; and on it, plundered and bereft, unwatched, unwept, uncared for, was the body of this man.\nScrooge glanced towards the Phantom. Its steady hand was pointed to the head. The cover was so carelessly adjusted that the slightest raising of it, the motion of a finger upon Scrooge’s part, would have disclosed the face. He thought of it, felt how easy it would be to do, and longed to do it; but had no more power to withdraw the veil than to dismiss the spectre at his side.\nOh cold, cold, rigid, dreadful Death, set up thine altar here, and dress it with such terrors as thou hast at thy command: for this is thy dominion! But of the loved, revered, and honoured head, thou canst not turn one hair to thy dread purposes, or make one feature odious. It is not that the hand is heavy and will fall down when released; it is not that the heart and pulse are still; but that the hand was open, generous, and true; the heart brave, warm, and tender; and the pulse a man’s. Strike, Shadow, strike! And see his good deeds springing from the wound, to sow the world with life immortal!\nNo voice pronounced these words in Scrooge’s ears, and yet he heard them when he looked upon the bed. He thought, if this man could be raised up now, what would be his foremost thoughts? Avarice, hard-dealing, griping cares? They have brought him to a rich end, truly!\nHe lay, in the dark empty house, with not a man, a woman, or a child, to say that he was kind to me in this or that, and for the memory of one kind word I will be kind to him. A cat was tearing at the door, and there was a sound of gnawing rats beneath the hearth-stone. What they wanted in the room of death, and why they were so restless and disturbed, Scrooge did not dare to think.\n“Spirit!” he said, “this is a fearful place. In leaving it, I shall not leave its lesson, trust me. Let us go!”\nStill the Ghost pointed with an unmoved finger to the head.\n“I understand you,” Scrooge returned, “and I would do it, if I could. But I have not the power, Spirit. I have not the power.”\nAgain it seemed to look upon him.\n“If there is any person in the town, who feels emotion caused by this man’s death,” said Scrooge quite agonised, “show that person to me, Spirit, I beseech you!”",

The figure beneath the ragged sheet was motionless, but the silence was more eloquent than any words could be. The room was cold and bleak, the air heavy with the scent of decay and sorrow. Scrooge's breath caught in his throat as he realized the dreadful truth: the figure was himself, lying lifeless and forgotten.\n\nThe Spirit of Christmas Yet to Come stood silently beside him, pointing with a solemn finger toward the bed. Scrooge's eyes filled with tears as he saw the loneliness and neglect that surrounded his own death. No mourners, no friends, no family—only the cold, empty room and the shrouded figure.\n\nHe stepped back, trembling, and the scene shifted once more. Now he was in a dark, narrow street, where a group of people gathered around a small, shabby grave. The name on the headstone was his own. The crowd was indifferent, some even relieved, as if his passing was a release from a life of misery and greed.\n\nScrooge's heart pounded fiercely. \"Spirit,\" he cried, \"tell me if Tiny Tim will live!

He cared for Tiny Tim as if he were his own son, and the Cratchit family flourished under his benevolence.\n\nThe shadows of the future were dispelled by the light of his newfound compassion, and Christmas was celebrated with warmth and happiness in his heart forevermore."

There was a remarkable expression in it now; a kind of serious delight of which he felt ashamed, and which he struggled to repress.\nHe sat down to the dinner that had been hoarding for him by the fire; and when she asked him faintly what news (which was not until after a long silence), he appeared embarrassed how to answer.\n“Is it good?” she said, “or bad?”—to help him.\n“Bad,” he answered.\n“We are quite ruined?”\n“No. There is hope yet, Caroline.”\n“If he relents,” she said, amazed, “there is! Nothing is past hope, if such a miracle has happened.”\n“He is past relenting,” said her husband. “He is dead.”\nShe was a mild and patient creature if her face spoke truth; but she was thankful in her soul to hear it, and she said so, with clasped hands. She prayed forgiveness the next moment, and was sorry; but the first was the emotion of her heart.\n“What the half-drunken woman whom I told you of last night, said to me, when I tried to see him and obtain a week’s delay; and what I thought was a mere excuse to avoid me; turns out to have been quite true. He was not only very ill, but dying, then.”\n“To whom will our debt be transferred?”\n“I don’t know. But before that time we shall be ready with the money; and even though we were not, it would be a bad fortune indeed to find so merciless a creditor in his successor. We may sleep to-night with light hearts, Caroline!”\nYes. Soften it as they would, their hearts were lighter. The children’s faces, hushed and clustered round to hear what they so little understood, were brighter; and it was a happier house for this man’s death! The only emotion that the Ghost could show him, caused by the event, was one of pleasure.",

MISSING ELEMENTS:\n- Early in the passage, the mother’s specific behaviors indicating anxiety and anticipation are missing, such as her interactions with the environment and her attempts to occupy herself.\n- The moment of the long-expected knock and her hurried movement to the door are not described, which lessens the impact of the husband’s arrival.\n- The original’s depiction of the husband’s struggle with his emotions and the delay before the conversation about the news is shortened, losing the sense of awkward silence and emotional complexity.\n- The children’s reactions and their presence during the conversation are underdeveloped, with little detail about their behavior or the atmosphere in the room.\n\n3. INACCURATE ELEMENTS:\n- The completion introduces a direct question from the wife (“Is it true?”) that does not match the original sequence or phrasing, altering the flow of the conversation.\n- The husband’s responses are simplified and do not reflect the original’s nuanced exchange, including the order and manner in which hope and ruin are discussed.\n- The description of the wife’s character is moved to the beginning, rather than being revealed through her actions and reactions as in the original.\n- The summary of the man’s recounting of the creditor’s illness is less detailed and omits the context of the previous night’s events and the specific interaction with another character.\n- The ending generalizes the emotional outcome, rather than showing the gradual softening and the children’s specific reactions as in the original."

The children, rosy-cheeked and bright-eyed, were gathered around her, their laughter filling the room with a joyous melody. The eldest boy was reading aloud from a well-worn book, his voice animated and full of life, while the younger ones listened intently, their imaginations captured by the tale.\n\nAs the scene unfolded, the Phantom's voice echoed softly, \"This is the Cratchit family, humble yet rich in love and happiness. Though their means are modest, their hearts are generous and their spirits unbroken.\"\n\nScrooge watched intently, a pang of remorse stirring within him. He saw Bob Cratchit, the devoted father, working tirelessly to provide for his family despite the hardships they faced. Tiny Tim, the youngest son, sat quietly, his frail frame supported by a crutch, yet his eyes shone with hope and innocence.\n\nThe vision shifted, revealing moments of tenderness and resilience: Mrs. Cratchit preparing a simple but hearty meal, the children sharing stories and dreams, and Bob Cratchit expressing gratitude for the blessings they possessed. The warmth of their love contrasted starkly with the coldness that had gripped Scrooge's own heart for so many years.\n\nMoved by the scene, Scrooge felt a newfound compassion awaken within him. He realized that wealth and possessions were fleeting, but the bonds of family and kindness endured beyond measure. The Phantom's presence was a reminder of the consequences of his actions and the opportunity for redemption.\n\nAs the vision faded, Scrooge found himself back in his own chamber, the morning light streaming through the window. Determined to change his ways, he resolved to embrace generosity and goodwill, to cherish the people around him, and to honor the true spirit of Christmas. The journey ahead was uncertain, but for the first time in a long while, hope blossomed in his heart."

They entered poor Bob Cratchit’s house; the dwelling he had visited before; and found the mother and the children seated round the fire.\nQuiet. Very quiet. The noisy little Cratchits were as still as statues in one corner, and sat looking up at Peter, who had a book before him. The mother and her daughters were engaged in sewing. But surely they were very quiet!\n“ ‘And He took a child, and set him in the midst of them.’ ”\nWhere had Scrooge heard those words? He had not dreamed them. The boy must have read them out, as he and the Spirit crossed the threshold. Why did he not go on?\nThe mother laid her work upon the table, and put her hand up to her face.\n“The colour hurts my eyes,” she said.\nThe colour? Ah, poor Tiny Tim!\n“They’re better now again,” said Cratchit’s wife. “It makes them weak by candle-light; and I wouldn’t show weak eyes to your father when he comes home, for the world. It must be near his time.”\n“Past it rather,” Peter answered, shutting up his book. “But I think he has walked a little slower than he used, these few last evenings, mother.”\nThey were very quiet again. At last she said, and in a steady, cheerful voice, that only faltered once:\n“I have known him walk with—I have known him walk with Tiny Tim upon his shoulder, very fast indeed.”\n“And so have I,” cried Peter. “Often.”\n“And so have I,” exclaimed another. So had all.\n“But he was very light to carry,” she resumed, intent upon her work, “and his father loved him so, that it was no trouble: no trouble. And there is your father at the door!”\nShe hurried out to meet him; and little Bob in his comforter—he had need of it, poor fellow—came in. His tea was ready for him on the hob, and they all tried who should help him to it most. Then the two young Cratchits got upon his knees and laid, each child a little cheek, against his face, as if they said, “Don’t mind it, father. Don’t be grieved!”\nBob was very cheerful with them, and spoke pleasantly to all the family. He looked at the work upon the table, and praised the industry and speed of Mrs. Cratchit and the girls. They would be done long before Sunday, he said.\n“Sunday! You went to-day, then, Robert?” said his wife.\n“Yes, my dear,” returned Bob. “I wish you could have gone. It would have done you good to see how green a place it is. But you’ll see it often. I promised him that I would walk there on a Sunday. My little, little child!” cried Bob. “My little child!”\nHe broke down all at once. He couldn’t help it. If he could have helped it, he and his child would have been farther apart perhaps than they were.\nHe left the room, and went up-stairs into the room above, which was lighted cheerfully, and hung with Christmas. There was a chair set close beside the child, and there were signs of some one having been there, lately. Poor Bob sat down in it, and when he had thought a little and composed himself, he kissed the little face. He was reconciled to what had happened, and went down again quite happy.\nThey drew about the fire, and talked; the girls and mother working still. Bob told them of the extraordinary kindness of Mr. Scrooge’s nephew, whom he had scarcely seen but once, and who, meeting him in the street that day, and seeing that he looked a little—“just a little down you know,” said Bob, inquired what had happened to distress him. “On which,” said Bob, “for he is the pleasantest-spoken gentleman you ever heard, I told him. ‘I am heartily sorry for it, Mr. Cratchit,’ he said, ‘and heartily sorry for your good wife.’ By the bye, how he ever knew that, I don’t know.”\n“Knew what, my dear?”\n“Why, that you were a good wife,” replied Bob.\n“Everybody knows that!” said Peter.\n“Very well observed, my boy!” cried Bob. “I hope they do. ‘Heartily sorry,’ he said, ‘for your good wife. If I can be of service to you in any way,’ he said, giving me his card, ‘that’s where I live. Pray come to me.’ Now, it wasn’t,” cried Bob, “for the sake of anything he might be able to do for us, so much as for his kind way, that this was quite delightful. It really seemed as if he had known our Tiny Tim, and felt with us.”\n“I’m sure he’s a good soul!” said Mrs. Cratchit.\n“You would be surer of it, my dear,” returned Bob, “if you saw and spoke to him. I shouldn’t be at all surprised—mark what I say!—if he got Peter a better situation.”\n“Only hear that, Peter,” said Mrs. Cratchit.\n“And then,” cried one of the girls, “Peter will be keeping company with some one, and setting up for himself.”\n“Get along with you!” retorted Peter, grinning.\n“It’s just as likely as not,” said Bob, “one of these days; though there’s plenty of time for that, my dear. But however and whenever we part from one another, I am sure we shall none of us forget poor Tiny Tim—shall we—or this first parting that there was among us?”\n“Never, father!” cried they all.\n“And I know,” said Bob, “I know, my dears, that when we recollect how patient and how mild he was; although he was a little, little child; we shall not quarrel easily among ourselves, and forget poor Tiny Tim in doing it.”\n“No, never, father!” they all cried again.\n“I am very happy,” said little Bob, “I am very happy!”\nMrs. Cratchit kissed him, his daughters kissed him, the two young Cratchits kissed him, and Peter and himself shook hands.

He saw the young woman rise and approach a simple wooden box, which she opened to reveal a collection of letters and mementos. She spoke softly, recounting memories of the departed, her words filled with love and reverence.\n\nThe Spirit's voice broke the silence. \"This is the home of the Cratchit family, Ebenezer. Though they have little in wealth, their hearts are rich with kindness and affection. The death they mourn is that of Tiny Tim, a child whose spirit touched all who knew him.\"\n\nScrooge felt a pang of sorrow and regret. He had been blind to the struggles and joys of those around him, consumed by his own greed and isolation. Yet here, in this humble gathering, he saw the true meaning of life and death intertwined with love and compassion.\n\nThe scene shifted, and Scrooge found himself alone once more. The Spirit's form began to fade, but not before imparting a final message. \"Remember, Ebenezer, that it is not too late to change. The past, present, and future are yours to shape. Embrace the tenderness you have witnessed, and let it guide you to a better path.\"\n\nAs the first light of dawn crept through the window, Scrooge awoke with a start. The visions of the night lingered in his mind, filling him with a newfound resolve. He rose from his bed, determined to open his heart and share the warmth he had long denied.\n\nFrom that day forward, Ebenezer Scrooge became a man transformed. He sought out the Cratchit family, offering support and friendship. He extended kindness to all he met, spreading joy and generosity throughout the town.\n\nThe dark chamber of his past was replaced by the bright light of compassion, and in embracing tenderness connected with death, Scrooge found the true spirit of Christmas and the enduring power of love."

It was the ghost of Jacob Marley, his former business partner, who appeared to Ebenezer Scrooge on that cold Christmas Eve. Marley’s face was wrinkled and his eyes were sunken, but his expression was one of deep sorrow and warning. Chains clanked around his body, forged from the ledgers and cash boxes he had once treasured in life. Marley’s spirit told Scrooge that he was doomed to wander the earth in torment because of his greed and selfishness, and that Scrooge would share the same fate unless he changed his ways.\n\nMarley revealed that three spirits would visit Scrooge that night. The first, the Ghost of Christmas Past, would show him scenes from his own earlier life, reminding him of the joys and innocence he had lost. The second, the Ghost of Christmas Present, would reveal the happiness and hardships of those around him, including the Cratchit family, whose youngest son, Tiny Tim, was frail and in need of care. The third, the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come, would present a grim future if Scrooge continued on his current path.\n\nThrough these visions, Scrooge was transformed. He saw the error of his ways and awakened on Christmas morning with a heart full of generosity and kindness. He embraced the spirit of Christmas, helping those in need and becoming a beloved figure in his community. The finger that once pointed from the grave now symbolized a turning point—a chance for redemption and hope."

I know they will!”\nHis hands were busy with his garments all this time; turning them inside out, putting them on upside down, tearing them, mislaying them, making them parties to every kind of extravagance.\n“I don’t know what to do!” cried Scrooge, laughing and crying in the same breath; and making a perfect Laocoön of himself with his stockings. “I am as light as a feather, I am as happy as an angel, I am as merry as a schoolboy. I am as giddy as a drunken man. A merry Christmas to everybody! A happy New Year to all the world. Hallo here! Whoop! Hallo!”\nHe had frisked into the sitting-room, and was now standing there: perfectly winded.\n“There’s the saucepan that the gruel was in!” cried Scrooge, starting off again, and going round the fireplace. “There’s the door, by which the Ghost of Jacob Marley entered! There’s the corner where the Ghost of Christmas Present, sat! There’s the window where I saw the wandering Spirits! It’s all right, it’s all true, it all happened. Ha ha ha!”",

At last, summoning all his resolve, he raised his hand and rapped sharply on the weathered wood. The door creaked open, revealing a dimly lit room where a solitary figure sat by the fire. It was Ebenezer Scrooge, the miserly old man known throughout the town for his cold heart and bitter ways. The visitor stepped inside, the warmth of the hearth contrasting with the chill outside. \"Mr. Scrooge,\" he began, \"I have come to speak with you about the true spirit of Christmas.\" Scrooge's eyes narrowed, suspicion flickering across his face. \"Bah! Humbug!\" he exclaimed, dismissing the notion with a wave of his hand. But the visitor was undeterred. \"There is more to this season than coins and ledgers,\" he said gently. \"It is a time for kindness, for generosity, and for opening one's heart to others.\" As the night wore on, the visitor shared stories of joy and goodwill, slowly chipping away at Scrooge's hardened exterior. By dawn, the old man found himself transformed, his heart swelling with newfound warmth and compassion. From that day forward, Ebenezer Scrooge embraced the spirit of Christmas, spreading cheer and goodwill to all he met."
