Hard and sharp as flint, from which no steel had ever struck out generous fire; secret, and self-contained, and solitary as an oyster. The cold within him froze his old features, nipped his pointed nose, shrivelled his cheek, stiffened his gait; made his eyes red, his thin lips blue; and spoke out shrewdly in his grating voice.

He carried his own low temperature always about with him; he iced his office in the dog-days; and didn’t thaw it one degree at Christmas.\nExternal heat and cold had little influence on Scrooge. No warmth could warm, no wintry weather chill him. No wind that blew was bitterer than he, no falling snow was more intent upon its purpose, no pelting rain less open to entreaty. Foul weather didn’t know where to have him. The heaviest rain, and snow, and hail, and sleet, could boast of the advantage over him in only one respect.

What right have you to be merry? What reason have you to be merry? You’re poor enough.”\n“Come, then,” returned the nephew gaily. “What right have you to be dismal? What reason have you to be morose? You’re rich enough.”\nScrooge having no better answer ready on the spur of the moment, said, “Bah!” again; and followed it up with “Humbug.”\n“Don’t be cross, uncle!” said the nephew.\n“What else can I be,” returned the uncle, “when I live in such a world of fools as this? Merry Christmas! Out upon merry Christmas! What’s Christmas time to you but a time for paying bills without money; a time for finding yourself a year older, but not an hour richer; a time for balancing your books and having every item in ’em through a round dozen of months presented dead against you? If I could work my will,” said Scrooge indignantly, “every idiot who goes about with ‘Merry Christmas’ on his lips, should be boiled with his own pudding, and buried with a stake of holly through his heart. He should!”\n“Uncle!” pleaded the nephew.\n“Nephew!” returned the uncle sternly, “keep Christmas in your own way, and let me keep it in mine.”\n“Keep it!” repeated Scrooge’s nephew. “But you don’t keep it.”\n“Let me leave it alone, then,” said Scrooge. “Much good may it do you! Much good it has ever done you!”\n“There are many things from which I might have derived good, by which I have not profited, I dare say,” returned the nephew. “Christmas among the rest. But I am sure I have always thought of Christmas time, when it has come round—apart from the veneration due to its sacred name and origin, if anything belonging to it can be apart from that—as a good time; a kind, forgiving, charitable, pleasant time; the only time I know of, in the long calendar of the year, when men and women seem by one consent to open their shut-up hearts freely, and to think of people below them as if they really were fellow-passengers to the grave, and not another race of creatures bound on other journeys. And therefore, uncle, though it has never put a scrap of gold or silver in my pocket, I believe that it has done me good, and will do me good; and I say, God bless it!”\nThe clerk in the Tank involuntarily applauded. Becoming immediately sensible of the impropriety, he poked the fire, and extinguished the last frail spark for ever.\n“Let me hear another sound from you,” said Scrooge, “and you’ll keep your Christmas by losing your situation! You’re quite a powerful speaker, sir,” he added, turning to his nephew. “I wonder you don’t go into Parliament.”\n“Don’t be angry, uncle. Come! Dine with us to-morrow.”\nScrooge said that he would see him—yes, indeed he did. He went the whole length of the expression, and said that he would see him in that extremity first.\n“But why?” cried Scrooge’s nephew. “Why?”\n“Why did you get married?” said Scrooge.\n“Because I fell in love.”\n“Because you fell in love!” growled Scrooge, as if that were the only one thing in the world more ridiculous than a merry Christmas. “Good afternoon!”\n“Nay, uncle, but you never came to see me before that happened. Why give it as a reason for not coming now?”\n“Good afternoon,” said Scrooge.\n“I want nothing from you; I ask nothing of you; why cannot we be friends?”\n“Good afternoon,” said Scrooge.\n“I am sorry, with all my heart, to find you so resolute. We have never had any quarrel, to which I have been a party. But I have made the trial in homage to Christmas, and I’ll keep my Christmas humour to the last. So A Merry Christmas, uncle!”\n“Good afternoon!” said Scrooge.\n“And A Happy New Year!”\n“Good afternoon!” said Scrooge.\nHis nephew left the room without an angry word, notwithstanding. He stopped at the outer door to bestow the greetings of the season on the clerk, who, cold as he was, was warmer than Scrooge; for he returned them cordially.\n“There’s another fellow,” muttered Scrooge; who overheard him: “my clerk, with fifteen shillings a week, and a wife and family, talking about a merry Christmas. I’ll retire to Bedlam.”\nThis lunatic, in letting Scrooge’s nephew out, had let two other people in. They were portly gentlemen, pleasant to behold, and now stood, with their hats off, in Scrooge’s office. They had books and papers in their hands, and bowed to him.\n“Scrooge and Marley’s, I believe,” said one of the gentlemen, referring to his list. “Have I the pleasure of addressing Mr. Scrooge, or Mr. Marley?”\n“Mr. Marley has been dead these seven years,” Scrooge replied. “He died seven years ago, this very night.”\n“We have no doubt his liberality is well represented by his surviving partner,” said the gentleman, presenting his credentials.\nIt certainly was; for they had been two kindred spirits. At the ominous word “liberality,” Scrooge frowned, and shook his head, and handed the credentials back.\n“At this festive season of the year, Mr. Scrooge,” said the gentleman, taking up a pen, “it is more than usually desirable that we should make some slight provision for the Poor and destitute, who suffer greatly at the present time. Many thousands are in want of common necessaries; hundreds of thousands are in want of common comforts, sir.”\n“Are there no prisons?” asked Scrooge.\n“Plenty of prisons,” said the gentleman, laying down the pen again.\n“And the Union workhouses?” demanded Scrooge. “Are they still in operation?”\n“They are. Still,” returned the gentleman, “I wish I could say they were not.”\n“The Treadmill and the Poor Law are in full vigour, then?” said Scrooge.\n“Both very busy, sir.”\n“Oh! I was afraid, from what you said at first, that something had occurred to stop them in their useful course,” said Scrooge. “I’m very glad to hear it.”\n“Under the impression that they scarcely furnish Christian cheer of mind or body to the multitude,” returned the gentleman, “a few of us are endeavouring to raise a fund to buy the Poor some meat and drink, and means of warmth. We choose this time, because it is a time, of all others, when Want is keenly felt, and Abundance rejoices. What shall I put you down for?”\n“Nothing!” Scrooge replied.\n“You wish to be anonymous?”\n“I wish to be left alone,” said Scrooge. “Since you ask me what I wish, gentlemen, that is my answer. I don’t make merry myself at Christmas and I can’t afford to make idle people merry. I help to support the establishments I have mentioned—they cost enough; and those who are badly off must go there.”\n“Many can’t go there; and many would rather die.”\n“If they would rather die,” said Scrooge, “they had better do it, and decrease the surplus population. Besides—excuse me—I don’t know that.”\n“But you might know it,” observed the gentleman.\n“It’s not my business,” Scrooge returned. “It’s enough for a man to understand his own business, and not to interfere with other people’s. Mine occupies me constantly. Good afternoon, gentlemen!”\nSeeing clearly that it would be useless to pursue their point, the gentlemen withdrew. Scrooge resumed his labours with an improved opinion of himself, and in a more facetious temper than was usual with him.",

It was the voice of Scrooge’s nephew, who came upon him so quickly that this was the first intimation he had of his approach.\n\n“Bah!” said Scrooge. “Humbug!”\n\nHe had so heated himself with rapid walking in the fog and frost, this nephew of Scrooge’s, that he was all in a glow; his face was ruddy and handsome; his eyes sparkled, and his breath smoked again.\n\n“Christmas a humbug, uncle!” said Scrooge’s nephew. “You don’t mean that, I am sure?”\n\n“I do,” said Scrooge. “Merry Christmas!

Merry Christmas! Out upon merry Christmas! What’s Christmas time to you but a time for paying bills without money; a time for finding yourself a year older, and not an hour richer; a time for balancing your books and having every item in ’em through a round dozen of months presented dead against you? If I could work my will,” said Scrooge indignantly, “every idiot who goes about with ‘Merry Christmas’ on his lips, should be boiled with his own pudding, and buried with a stake of holly through his heart. He should!”\n\n“Uncle!” pleaded the nephew.\n\n“Nephew!” returned the uncle sternly, “keep Christmas in your own way, and let me keep it in mine.”\n\n“Keep it!” repeated Scrooge’s nephew. “But you don’t keep it.”\n\n“Let me leave it alone, then,” said Scrooge. “Much good may it do you!

The cold became intense. In the main street, at the corner of the court, some labourers were repairing the gas-pipes, and had lighted a great fire in a brazier, round which a party of ragged men and boys were gathered: warming their hands and winking their eyes before the blaze in rapture. The water-plug being left in solitude, its overflowings sullenly congealed, and turned to misanthropic ice. The brightness of the shops where holly sprigs and berries crackled in the lamp heat of the windows, made pale faces ruddy as they passed. Poulterers’ and grocers’ trades became a splendid joke: a glorious pageant, with which it was next to impossible to believe that such dull principles as bargain and sale had anything to do. The Lord Mayor, in the stronghold of the mighty Mansion House, gave orders to his fifty cooks and butlers to keep Christmas as a Lord Mayor’s household should; and even the little tailor, whom he had fined five shillings on the previous Monday for being drunk and bloodthirsty in the streets, stirred up to-morrow’s pudding in his garret, while his lean wife and the baby sallied out to buy the beef.\nFoggier yet, and colder. Piercing, searching, biting cold. If the good Saint Dunstan had but nipped the Evil Spirit’s nose with a touch of such weather as that, instead of using his familiar weapons, then indeed he would have roared to lusty purpose. The owner of one scant young nose, gnawed and mumbled by the hungry cold as bones are gnawed by dogs, stooped down at Scrooge’s keyhole to regale him with a Christmas carol: but at the first sound of\n“God bless you, merry gentleman!\n  May nothing you dismay!”\nScrooge seized the ruler with such energy of action, that the singer fled in terror, leaving the keyhole to the fog and even more congenial frost.\nAt length the hour of shutting up the counting-house arrived. With an ill-will Scrooge dismounted from his stool, and tacitly admitted the fact to the expectant clerk in the Tank, who instantly snuffed his candle out, and put on his hat.\n“You’ll want all day to-morrow, I suppose?” said Scrooge.\n“If quite convenient, sir.”\n“It’s not convenient,” said Scrooge, “and it’s not fair. If I was to stop half-a-crown for it, you’d think yourself ill-used, I’ll be bound?”\nThe clerk smiled faintly.\n“And yet,” said Scrooge, “you don’t think me ill-used, when I pay a day’s wages for no work.”\nThe clerk observed that it was only once a year.\n“A poor excuse for picking a man’s pocket every twenty-fifth of December!” said Scrooge, buttoning his great-coat to the chin. “But I suppose you must have the whole day. Be here all the earlier next morning.”\nThe clerk promised that he would; and Scrooge walked out with a growl. The office was closed in a twinkling, and the clerk, with the long ends of his white comforter dangling below his waist (for he boasted no great-coat), went down a slide on Cornhill, at the end of a lane of boys, twenty times, in honour of its being Christmas Eve, and then ran home to Camden Town as hard as he could pelt, to play at blindman’s-buff.",

The fog and frost so hung about the black old gateway of the house, that it seemed as if the Genius of the Weather sat in mournful meditation on the threshold. Now, it is a fact, that there was nothing at all particular about the knocker on the door, except that it was very large. It is also a fact, that Scrooge had seen it, night and morning, during his whole residence in that place; also that Scrooge had as little of what is called fancy about him as any man in the city of London, even including—which is a bold word—the corporation, aldermen, and livery. Let it also be borne in mind that Scrooge had not bestowed one thought on Marley, since his last mention of his seven years' dead partner that afternoon. And yet he had no more retired from it than he had stepped into the street. But I am running before my story, it seems. It is enough that you understand that there was what is called a dingy play of light on the church wall, and a dense fog overhead, and you know the story. To resume. The door of Scrooge's counting-house was open that he might keep his eye upon his clerk, who in a dismal little cell beyond, a sort of tank, was copying letters. Scrooge had a very small fire, but the clerk's fire was so very much smaller that it looked like one coal. But he couldn't replenish it, for Scrooge kept the coal-box in his own room; and so surely as the clerk came in with the shovel, the master predicted that it would be necessary for them to part. Wherefore the clerk put on his white comforter, and tried to warm himself at the candle; in which effort, not being a man of strong imagination, he failed. \"A merry Christmas, uncle! God save you!\" cried a cheerful voice. It was the voice of Scrooge's nephew, who came upon him so quickly that this was the first intimation he had of his approach. \"Bah!\" said Scrooge, \"Humbug!\" He had so heated himself with rapid walking in the fog and frost, this nephew of Scrooge's, that he was all in a glow; his face was ruddy and handsome; his eyes sparkled, and his breath smoked again. \"Christmas a humbug, uncle!\" said Scrooge's nephew. \"You don't mean that, I am sure?\" \"I do,\" said Scrooge. \"Merry Christmas! What right have you to be merry? What right have you to be happy? You're poor enough.\" \"Come, then,\" returned the nephew gaily. \"What right have you to be dismal? What right have you to be morose? You're rich enough.\" Scrooge having no better answer ready on the spur of the moment, said, \"Bah!\" again; and followed it up with \"Humbug.\" \"Don't be cross, uncle!\" said the nephew. \"What else can I be,\" returned the uncle, \"when I live in such a world of fools as this? Merry Christmas! Out upon merry Christmas! What's Christmas time to you but a time for paying bills without money; a time for finding yourself a year older, and not an hour richer; a time for balancing your books and having every item in 'em through a round dozen of months presented dead against you? If I could work my will,\" said Scrooge indignantly, \"every idiot who goes about with 'Merry Christmas' on his lips, should be boiled with his own pudding, and buried with a stake of holly through his heart. He should!\" \"Uncle!\" pleaded the nephew. \"Nephew!\" returned the uncle sternly, \"keep Christmas in your own way, and let me keep it in mine.\" \"Keep it!\" repeated Scrooge's nephew. \"But you don't keep it.\" \"Let me leave it alone, then,\" said Scrooge. \"Much good may it do you! Much good it has ever done you!\" \"There are many things from which I might have derived good, by which I have not profited, I dare say,\" returned the nephew. \"Christmas among the rest. But I am sure I have always thought of Christmas time, when it has come round—apart from the veneration due to its sacred name and origin, if anything belonging to it can be apart from that—as a good time: a kind, forgiving, charitable, pleasant",

A boy came by, singing at the keyhole of the office door, the carol he was singing was 'God rest you merry, gentlemen, May nothing you dismay!' Scrooge seized the ruler with such energy of action that the singer fled in terror, leaving the keyhole to the fog and the frost. At length the hour of shutting up the counting-house arrived. With an ill-will Scrooge dismounted from his stool, and tacitly admitted the fact to the expectant clerk in the Tank, who instantly snuffed his candle out, and put on his hat. 'You'll want all day to-morrow, I suppose?' said Scrooge. 'If quite convenient, sir.' 'It's not convenient,' said Scrooge, 'and it's not fair. If I was to stop half-a-crown for it, you'd think yourself ill-used, I'll be bound?' The clerk smiled faintly. 'And yet,' said Scrooge, 'you don't think me ill-used, when I pay a day's wages for no work.' The clerk observed that it was only once a year. 'A poor excuse for picking a man's pocket every twenty-fifth of December!' said Scrooge, buttoning his great-coat to the chin. 'But I suppose you must have the whole day. Be here all the earlier next morning.' The clerk promised that he would; and it was a happy man indeed who ran down the slide at the end of the street, at the end of a lane of boys, twenty times, in honour of its being Christmas Eve, and then ran home to Camden Town as hard as he could pelt, to play at blindman's-buff.",

MAJOR STRUCTURAL ISSUES:\n- The completion introduces a lengthy invented conversation between Scrooge and his nephew, which does not occur in this section of the original passage. This dialogue and the associated scene are out of place and disrupt the intended sequence of events.\n- The completion omits the entire segment involving the caroler at Scrooge’s keyhole and Scrooge’s reaction, which is a significant event in the original.\n- The completion skips over the transition to the closing of the counting-house, the exchange between Scrooge and his clerk about the next day off, and the clerk’s joyful departure, all of which are essential to the original’s progression.\n\n2. MISSING ELEMENTS:\n- The completion lacks the description of the increasing cold and the specific atmospheric conditions that follow the initial setting, including the reference to a historical or legendary figure and the vivid depiction of the weather’s effect on people and objects.\n- The actions and experiences of the clerk after leaving work, including his playful activities and journey home, are not present.\n- The completion does not include the exchange between Scrooge and his clerk regarding the holiday, nor the clerk’s promise and Scrooge’s final departure.\n\n3. INACCURATE ELEMENTS:\n- The completion inaccurately attributes actions and dialogue to characters that do not occur at this point in the narrative, such as the nephew’s arrival and the extended conversation about Christmas.\n- There is a misplacement of details about the church tower and the fog, which are repeated or reworded in a way that disrupts the original sequence.\n- The completion introduces invented reflections and narrative commentary about Scrooge’s thoughts and the knocker, which are not part of this passage and belong elsewhere in the book.\n- The sequence of events is altered, with later scenes and conversations inserted prematurely, resulting in a loss of the original’s chronological flow."

It was old enough now, and dreary enough, for nobody lived in it but Scrooge, the other rooms being all let out as offices.

The hair was curiously stirred, as if by breath or hot air; and, though the eyes were wide open, they were perfectly motionless.

As Scrooge looked fixedly at this phenomenon, it was a knocker again. He said, 'Pooh, pooh!' and closed the door with a bang. It was not a very large door; neither was there a great iron chest for a strong-box, standing outside, the street-door of the court, for everybody to lay his hand upon and gain assurance from, that I shall describe my master’s house as little better than a mere phenomenon. The truth is, that the house was old and dreary, and nobody lived in it but Scrooge. He double-locked himself in, which was not his custom.

Every room above, and every cask in the wine-merchant’s cellars below, appeared to have a separate peal of echoes of its own. Scrooge was not a man to be frightened by echoes. He fastened the door, and walked across the hall, and up the stairs; slowly too: trimming his candle as he went.\nYou may talk vaguely about driving a coach-and-six up a good old flight of stairs, or through a bad young Act of Parliament; but I mean to say you might have got a hearse up that staircase, and taken it broadwise, with the splinter-bar towards the wall and the door towards the balustrades: and done it easy. There was plenty of width for that, and room to spare; which is perhaps the reason why Scrooge thought he saw a locomotive hearse going on before him in the gloom. Half-a-dozen gas-lamps out of the street wouldn’t have lighted the entry too well, so you may suppose that it was pretty dark with Scrooge’s dip.\nUp Scrooge went, not caring a button for that. Darkness is cheap, and Scrooge liked it. But before he shut his heavy door, he walked through his rooms to see that all was right. He had just enough recollection of the face to desire to do that.\nSitting-room, bedroom, lumber-room. All as they should be. Nobody under the table, nobody under the sofa; a small fire in the grate; spoon and basin ready; and the little saucepan of gruel (Scrooge had a cold in his head) upon the hob. Nobody under the bed; nobody in the closet; nobody in his dressing-gown, which was hanging up in a suspicious attitude against the wall. Lumber-room as usual. Old fire-guard, old shoes, two fish-baskets, washing-stand on three legs, and a poker.\nQuite satisfied, he closed his door, and locked himself in; double-locked himself in, which was not his custom. Thus secured against surprise, he took off his cravat; put on his dressing-gown and slippers, and his nightcap; and sat down before the fire to take his gruel.\nIt was a very low fire indeed; nothing on such a bitter night. He was obliged to sit close to it, and brood over it, before he could extract the least sensation of warmth from such a handful of fuel. The fireplace was an old one, built by some Dutch merchant long ago, and paved all round with quaint Dutch tiles, designed to illustrate the Scriptures. There were Cains and Abels, Pharaoh’s daughters; Queens of Sheba, Angelic messengers descending through the air on clouds like feather-beds, Abrahams, Belshazzars, Apostles putting off to sea in butter-boats, hundreds of figures to attract his thoughts; and yet that face of Marley, seven years dead, came like the ancient Prophet’s rod, and swallowed up the whole. If each smooth tile had been a blank at first, with power to shape some picture on its surface from the disjointed fragments of his thoughts, there would have been a copy of old Marley’s head on every one.\n“Humbug!” said Scrooge; and walked across the room.\nAfter several turns, he sat down again. As he threw his head back in the chair, his glance happened to rest upon a bell, a disused bell, that hung in the room, and communicated for some purpose now forgotten with a chamber in the highest story of the building. It was with great astonishment, and with a strange, inexplicable dread, that as he looked, he saw this bell begin to swing. It swung so softly in the outset that it scarcely made a sound; but soon it rang out loudly, and so did every bell in the house.\nThis might have lasted half a minute, or a minute, but it seemed an hour. The bells ceased as they had begun, together. They were succeeded by a clanking noise, deep down below; as if some person were dragging a heavy chain over the casks in the wine-merchant’s cellar. Scrooge then remembered to have heard that ghosts in haunted houses were described as dragging chains.\nThe cellar-door flew open with a booming sound, and then he heard the noise much louder, on the floors below; then coming up the stairs; then coming straight towards his door.\n“It’s humbug still!” said Scrooge. “I won’t believe it.”\nHis colour changed though, when, without a pause, it came on through the heavy door, and passed into the room before his eyes. Upon its coming in, the dying flame leaped up, as though it cried, “I know him; Marley’s Ghost!” and fell again.",

But, before he shut his heavy door, he walked through his rooms to see that all was right.\n\nHe had just enough light to know that he was in his sitting-room, and that it was all as usual. The fireplace was in its usual state, the saucepan of gruel (Scrooge had a cold in his head) was upon the hob, and the chair he usually sat in was in its customary place. Upon the hearth stood a fender, and before the fender sat the saucepan of gruel. He walked into the bedroom. Seen it all. Under the table, under the sofa, under the bed. In the closet, and on the shelves. In the dressing-room, and on the top shelf. He went into the lumber-room. There was nothing in the lumber-room but old trunks, and boxes, and piles of paper.

                "refinement_prompt": "IMPROVEMENT GUIDANCE:\n1. MAJOR STRUCTURAL ISSUES:\n- The completion omits the detailed description of the echoes in every room and cask, which is a significant atmospheric element at the start.\n- The passage describing the width of the staircase and the elaborate comparison to a hearse being able to ascend it is condensed and lacks the step-by-step logic and humor of the original.\n- The sequence of Scrooge inspecting his rooms is shortened, missing the methodical listing and the sense of ritual in his actions.\n- The inventory of items in the lumber-room is missing, which contributes to the setting and Scrooge’s routine.\n\n2. MISSING ELEMENTS:\n- The completion does not include the specific mention of the inadequacy of the candle’s light and the comparison to gas-lamps, which sets the mood of darkness.\n- The detailed process of Scrooge checking under furniture and in specific places (under the table, under the sofa, under the bed, in the closet, in his dressing-gown) is summarized rather than enumerated.\n- The description of the fire’s weakness and Scrooge’s need to sit close to it for warmth is abbreviated, omitting the sense of discomfort and the night’s bitterness.\n- The original’s detailed list of the Dutch tile illustrations is reduced to a general mention, losing the variety and specificity of the images.\n- The metaphor comparing Marley’s face to the prophet’s rod swallowing up the other images is missing.\n- The process of Scrooge walking through his rooms before shutting the door is not as clearly sequenced.\n- The original’s description of the bells’ duration and the subjective sense of time is simplified.\n- The progression of the clanking noise from the cellar, up the stairs, and towards the door is less detailed.\n\n3. INACCURATE ELEMENTS:\n- The completion states that Scrooge double-locked the door before inspecting the rooms, whereas the original has him securing the door after his inspection.\n- The order of Scrooge’s actions (locking the door, inspecting rooms, changing clothes, sitting by the fire) is slightly altered, affecting the narrative flow.\n- The description of the cellar-door opening is changed from a “booming sound” to a “tremendous crash,” which is a tonal shift.\n- The completion omits the original’s mention of Scrooge’s cold and the saucepan of gruel on the hob, which adds to the character’s physical state and the scene’s realism.\n- The final description of the flame’s reaction to the ghost’s entrance is less vivid and omits the metaphorical comparison present in the original."

Marley in his pigtail, usual waistcoat, tights and boots; the tassels on the latter bristling, like his pigtail, and his coat-skirts, and the hair upon his head. The chain he drew was clasped about his middle. It was long, and wound about him like a tail; and it was made (for Scrooge observed it closely) of cash-boxes, keys, padlocks, ledgers, deeds, and heavy purses wrought in steel. His body was transparent; so that Scrooge, observing him, and looking through his waistcoat, could see the two buttons on his coat behind.\nScrooge had often heard it said that Marley had no bowels, but he had never believed it until now.\nNo, nor did he believe it even now. Though he looked the phantom through and through, and saw it standing before him; though he felt the chilling influence of its death-cold eyes; and marked the very texture of the folded kerchief bound about its head and chin, which wrapper he had not observed before; he was still incredulous, and fought against his senses.\n“How now!” said Scrooge, caustic and cold as ever. “What do you want with me?”\n“Much!”—Marley’s voice, no doubt about it.\n“Who are you?”\n“Ask me who I was.”\n“Who were you then?” said Scrooge, raising his voice. “You’re particular, for a shade.” He was going to say “to a shade,” but substituted this, as more appropriate.\n“In life I was your partner, Jacob Marley.”\n“Can you—can you sit down?” asked Scrooge, looking doubtfully at him.\n“I can.”\n“Do it, then.”\nScrooge asked the question, because he didn’t know whether a ghost so transparent might find himself in a condition to take a chair; and felt that in the event of its being impossible, it might involve the necessity of an embarrassing explanation. But the ghost sat down on the opposite side of the fireplace, as if he were quite used to it.\n“You don’t believe in me,” observed the Ghost.\n“I don’t,” said Scrooge.\n“What evidence would you have of my reality beyond that of your senses?”\n“I don’t know,” said Scrooge.\n“Why do you doubt your senses?”\n“Because,” said Scrooge, “a little thing affects them. A slight disorder of the stomach makes them cheats. You may be an undigested bit of beef, a blot of mustard, a crumb of cheese, a fragment of an underdone potato. There’s more of gravy than of grave about you, whatever you are!”\nScrooge was not much in the habit of cracking jokes, nor did he feel, in his heart, by any means waggish then. The truth is, that he tried to be smart, as a means of distracting his own attention, and keeping down his terror; for the spectre’s voice disturbed the very marrow in his bones.\nTo sit, staring at those fixed glazed eyes, in silence for a moment, would play, Scrooge felt, the very deuce with him. There was something very awful, too, in the spectre’s being provided with an infernal atmosphere of its own. Scrooge could not feel it himself, but this was clearly the case; for though the Ghost sat perfectly motionless, its hair, and skirts, and tassels, were still agitated as by the hot vapour from an oven.\n“You see this toothpick?” said Scrooge, returning quickly to the charge, for the reason just assigned; and wishing, though it were only for a second, to divert the vision’s stony gaze from himself.\n“I do,” replied the Ghost.\n“You are not looking at it,” said Scrooge.\n“But I see it,” said the Ghost, “notwithstanding.”\n“Well!” returned Scrooge, “I have but to swallow this, and be for the rest of my days persecuted by a legion of goblins, all of my own creation. Humbug, I tell you! humbug!”\nAt this the spirit raised a frightful cry, and shook its chain with such a dismal and appalling noise, that Scrooge held on tight to his chair, to save himself from falling in a swoon. But how much greater was his horror, when the phantom taking off the bandage round its head, as if it were too warm to wear indoors, its lower jaw dropped down upon its breast!\nScrooge fell upon his knees, and clasped his hands before his face.\n“Mercy!” he said. “Dreadful apparition, why do you trouble me?”\n“Man of the worldly mind!” replied the Ghost, “do you believe in me or not?”\n“I do,” said Scrooge. “I must. But why do spirits walk the earth, and why do they come to me?”\n“It is required of every man,” the Ghost returned, “that the spirit within him should walk abroad among his fellowmen, and travel far and wide; and if that spirit goes not forth in life, it is condemned to do so after death. It is doomed to wander through the world—oh, woe is me!—and witness what it cannot share, but might have shared on earth, and turned to happiness!”\nAgain the spectre raised a cry, and shook its chain and wrung its shadowy hands.\n“You are fettered,” said Scrooge, trembling. “Tell me why?”\n“I wear the chain I forged in life,” replied the Ghost. “I made it link by link, and yard by yard; I girded it on of my own free will, and of my own free will I wore it. Is its pattern strange to you?”\nScrooge trembled more and more.\n“Or would you know,” pursued the Ghost, “the weight and length of the strong coil you bear yourself? It was full as heavy and as long as this, seven Christmas Eves ago. You have laboured on it, since. It is a ponderous chain!”\nScrooge glanced about him on the floor, in the expectation of finding himself surrounded by some fifty or sixty fathoms of iron cable: but he could see nothing.\n“Jacob,” he said, imploringly. “Old Jacob Marley, tell me more. Speak comfort to me, Jacob!”\n“I have none to give,” the Ghost replied. “It comes from other regions, Ebenezer Scrooge, and is conveyed by other ministers, to other kinds of men. Nor can I tell you what I would. A very little more is all permitted to me. I cannot rest, I cannot stay, I cannot linger anywhere. My spirit never walked beyond our counting-house—mark me!—in life my spirit never roved beyond the narrow limits of our money-changing hole; and weary journeys lie before me!”\nIt was a habit with Scrooge, whenever he became thoughtful, to put his hands in his breeches pockets. Pondering on what the Ghost had said, he did so now, but without lifting up his eyes, or getting off his knees.\n“You must have been very slow about it, Jacob,” Scrooge observed, in a business-like manner, though with humility and deference.\n“Slow!” the Ghost repeated.\n“Seven years dead,” mused Scrooge. “And travelling all the time!”\n“The whole time,” said the Ghost. “No rest, no peace. Incessant torture of remorse.”\n“You travel fast?” said Scrooge.\n“On the wings of the wind,” replied the Ghost.\n“You might have got over a great quantity of ground in seven years,” said Scrooge.\nThe Ghost, on hearing this, set up another cry, and clanked its chain so hideously in the dead silence of the night, that the Ward would have been justified in indicting it for a nuisance.\n“Oh! captive, bound, and double-ironed,” cried the phantom, “not to know, that ages of incessant labour by immortal creatures, for this earth must pass into eternity before the good of which it is susceptible is all developed. Not to know that any Christian spirit working kindly in its little sphere, whatever it may be, will find its mortal life too short for its vast means of usefulness. Not to know that no space of regret can make amends for one life’s opportunity misused! Yet such was I! Oh! such was I!”\n“But you were always a good man of business, Jacob,” faltered Scrooge, who now began to apply this to himself.\n“Business!” cried the Ghost, wringing its hands again. “Mankind was my business. The common welfare was my business; charity, mercy, forbearance, and benevolence, were, all, my business. The dealings of my trade were but a drop of water in the comprehensive ocean of my business!”\nIt held up its chain at arm’s length, as if that were the cause of all its unavailing grief, and flung it heavily upon the ground again.\n“At this time of the rolling year,” the spectre said, “I suffer most. Why did I walk through crowds of fellow-beings with my eyes turned down, and never raise them to that blessed Star which led the Wise Men to a poor abode! Were there no poor homes to which its light would have conducted me!”\nScrooge was very much dismayed to hear the spectre going on at this rate, and began to quake exceedingly.\n“Hear me!” cried the Ghost. “My time is nearly gone.”\n“I will,” said Scrooge. “But don’t be hard upon me! Don’t be flowery, Jacob! Pray!”\n“How it is that I appear before you in a shape that you can see, I may not tell. I have sat invisible beside you many and many a day.”\nIt was not an agreeable idea. Scrooge shivered, and wiped the perspiration from his brow.\n“That is no light part of my penance,” pursued the Ghost. “I am here to-night to warn you, that you have yet a chance and hope of escaping my fate. A chance and hope of my procuring, Ebenezer.”\n“You were always a good friend to me,” said Scrooge. “Thank’ee!”\n“You will be haunted,” resumed the Ghost, “by Three Spirits.”\nScrooge’s countenance fell almost as low as the Ghost’s had done.\n“Is that the chance and hope you mentioned, Jacob?” he demanded, in a faltering voice.\n“It is.”\n“I—I think I’d rather not,” said Scrooge.\n“Without their visits,” said the Ghost, “you cannot hope to shun the path I tread.",

Marley in his pigtail, usual waistcoat, tights, and boots; the tassels on the latter bristling, like his pigtail, and his coat-skirts, and the hair upon his head. The chain he drew was clasped about his middle. It was long, and wound about him like a tail; and it was made (for Scrooge observed it closely) of cash-boxes, keys, padlocks, ledgers, deeds, and heavy purses wrought in steel. His body was transparent; so that Scrooge, observing him, and looking through his waistcoat, could see the two buttons on his coat behind. Scrooge had often heard it said that Marley had no bowels, but he had never believed it until now. No, nor did he believe it even now. Though he looked the phantom through and through, and saw it standing before him; though he felt the chilling influence of its death-cold eyes; and marked the very texture of the folded kerchief bound about its head and chin, which wrapper he had not observed before; he was still incredulous, and fought against his senses. 'How now!' said Scrooge, caustic and cold as ever. 'What do you want with me?' 'Much!'—Marley's voice, no doubt about it. 'Who are you?' 'Ask me who I was.' 'Who were you then?' said Scrooge, raising his voice. 'You're particular, for a shade.' He was going to say 'to a shade,' but substituted this, as more appropriate. 'In life I was your partner, Jacob Marley.' 'Can you—can you sit down?' asked Scrooge, looking doubtfully at him. 'I can.' 'Do it, then.' Scrooge asked the question, because he didn't know whether a ghost so transparent might find himself in a condition to take a chair; and felt that in the event of its being impossible, it might involve the necessity of an embarrassing explanation. But the ghost sat down on the opposite side of the fireplace, as if he were quite used to it. 'You don't believe in me,' observed the Ghost. 'I don't,' said Scrooge. 'What is it that brings you here?' asked Scrooge, looking not at the Ghost, but at the buttons on his coat. 'A slight disorder of the stomach,' returned Scrooge. 'You might be an undigested bit of beef, a blot of mustard, a crumb of cheese, a fragment of an underdone potato. There's more of gravy than of grave about you, whatever you are!' Scrooge was not much in the habit of cracking jokes, nor did he feel, in his heart, by any means waggish then. The truth is, that he tried to be smart, as a means of distracting his own attention, and keeping down his terror; for the spectre's voice disturbed the very marrow in his bones, and he was conscious of a chilling influence in the air that was conducted from the spirit's eyes. But he had scarcely finished this sentence, when the spectre raised a frightful cry, and shook its chain with such a dismal and appalling noise, that Scrooge would have been the first to tremble and fall prostrate before it. 'You are fettered,' said Scrooge, trembling. 'Tell me why?' 'I wear the chain I forged in life,' replied the Ghost. 'I made it link by link, and yard by yard; I girded it on of my own free will, and of my own free will I wore it. Is its pattern strange to you?' Scrooge trembled more and more. 'Or would you know,' pursued the Ghost, 'the weight and length of the strong coil you bear yourself? It was full as heavy and as long as this, seven Christmas Eves ago. You have laboured on it, since. It is a ponderous chain!' Scrooge glanced about him on the floor, in the expectation of finding himself surrounded by some fifty or sixty fathoms of iron cable: but he could see nothing. 'Jacob,' he said, imploringly. 'Old Jacob Marley, tell me more. Speak comfort to me, Jacob!' 'I have none to give,' the Ghost replied. 'It comes from other regions, Ebenezer Scrooge, and is conveyed by other ministers, to other kinds of men. Nor can I tell you what I would. A very little more is all permitted to me. I cannot rest, I cannot stay, I cannot linger anywhere. My spirit never walked beyond our counting-house—mark me!—in life my spirit never roved beyond the narrow limits of our money-changing hole; and weary journeys lie before me!' It was a terrible thing to see the spectre's eyes turn upon himself. It was awful to hear the spirit's groan when he said these words. He clasped his transparent hands in a mournful gesture, and made a sound with his chain, as if it were not already heavy enough. 'You are fettered,' said Scrooge, trembling. 'Tell me why?' 'I wear the chain I forged in life,' replied the Ghost. 'I made it link by link, and yard by yard; I girded it on of my own free will, and of my own free will I wore it.

            "prefix-probing": "The same face: the very same. Marley's face. It was not an optical illusion. It was Marley's face, in a phantom state, like a bad lobster in a dark cellar. It was not angry or ferocious, but looked at Scrooge with a dismal light in its eyes, and there was a spectral bandage bound about its head. As Scrooge looked intently at this phenomenon, it was a knocker again. To say that he was not startled would be untrue. But the truth is, he was not startled very much. Whatever else he was, he was not a man to be frightened by echoes. He did pause, with a momentary indecision, before he shut the door; and he did look cautiously behind it, as if he half expected to be confronted with the ghost of Marley's pigtail. But there was nothing behind the door, of course. The street was just as it had been before. No one was there. The fog and frost were as dense as ever. Having gone in, he closed the door, and double-locked himself in; which was not his custom. Thus secured against surprise, he took off his cravat, put on his dressing-gown and slippers, and his nightcap, and sat down before the fire to take his gruel. It was a very low fire indeed; nothing on it looked like coals, but a few cinders. He was obliged to sit close to it, and brood over it, before he could extract the least sensation of warmth from such a handful of fuel. The fireplace was an old one, built by some Dutch merchant long ago, and paved all round with quaint Dutch tiles, designed to illustrate the Scriptures. There were Cains and Abels, Pharaoh's daughters, Queens of Sheba, Angelic messengers descending through the air on clouds like feather-beds, Abrahams, Belshazzars, Apostles putting off to sea in butter-boats, hundreds of figures, to attract his thoughts; and yet that face of Marley, two minutes ago, on the very door-knocker, came back upon him like an indigestion. \"Pooh, pooh!\" said Scrooge, and tried to warm himself at the candle; but not being a man of strong imagination, he failed. The candle was an infamous affair, and gave off a miserable amount of heat. He was about to take his gruel when he heard the bells of the house, every one of them, begin to ring. Not a single bell, but all of them. The bells in the hall, the bells in the dining-parlour, the bells in the bedroom, the bells in the kitchen, all rang out loudly. This was succeeded by a clanking noise, deep down below; as if some person were dragging a heavy chain over the casks in the wine-merchant's cellar. Scrooge then remembered to have heard that ghosts in haunted houses were described as dragging chains. The noise grew louder, and came up into the hall. It came up the stairs. It came towards his door. \"It's humbug still!\" said Scrooge. \"I won't believe it.\" His colour changed though, when, without a pause, it came on through the heavy door, and passed into the room before his eyes. Upon its coming in, the dying flame leaped up, as though it cried, \"I know him! Marley's Ghost!\" and fell again. The same face: the very same. Marley in his pigtail, usual waistcoat, tights, and boots; the tassels on the latter bristling, like his pigtail, and his coat-skirts, and the hair upon his head. The chain he drew was clasped about his middle. It was long, and wound about him like a tail; and it was made (for Scrooge observed it closely) of cash-boxes, keys, padlocks, ledgers, deeds, and heavy purses wrought in steel. His body was transparent; so that Scrooge, looking through him, could see the two buttons on his coat behind. Scrooge had often heard it said that Marley had no bowels, but he had never believed it until now. No, nor did he believe it even now. Though he looked the phantom through and through, and saw it standing before him; though he felt the chilling influence of its death-cold eyes; and though he felt the sensation of its being there, and knew that he was in the presence of a Spirit, his old incredulity still strove with his senses. \"How now!\" said Scrooge, caustic and cold as ever. \"What do you want with me?\" \"Much!\"—Marley's voice, no doubt about it. \"Who are you?\" \"Ask me who I was.\" \"Who were you then?\" \"In life I was your partner, Jacob Marley.\" \"Can you—can you sit down?\" asked Scrooge, looking doubtfully at him. \"I can.\" \"Do it, then.\" Scrooge asked the question, because he didn't know whether a ghost so transparent might find himself in a condition to do it. And he felt that, in the antechamber of the spiritual world, a ghost might be in a state of uncertainty; but he was not much in the habit of holding spiritual intercourse, and had no idea of the sort of conversation that might be held with a ghost. The ghost sat down on the opposite side of the fireplace, as if he were quite used to it. \"You don't believe in me,\" observed the Ghost. \"I don't,\" said Scrooge. \"What evidence would you have of my reality beyond that of your senses?\" \"I don't know,\" said Scrooge. \"Why do you doubt your senses?\" \"Because,\" said Scrooge, \"a little thing affects them. A slight disorder of the stomach makes them cheats. You may be an undigested bit of beef, a blot of mustard, a crumb of cheese, a fragment of an underdone potato. There's more of gravy than of grave about you, whatever you are!\" Scrooge was not much in the habit of cracking jokes, nor did he feel, in his heart, any disposition to be pleasant, or merry, or jocose; but the humour of the thing, as well as the awful nature of the apparition, and the dread that seized him, were all together too much for him. \"You see this toothpick?\" said Scrooge, returning to his own manner, and holding it up. \"I do,\" replied the Ghost. \"You are not looking at it,\" said Scrooge. \"But I see it,\" said the Ghost, \"notwithstanding.\" \"Well!\" returned Scrooge. \"I have but to swallow this, and be for the rest of my days persecuted by a legion of goblins, all of my own creation. Humbug, I tell you! humbug!\" At this the spirit raised a frightful cry, and shook its chain with such a dismal and appalling noise, that Scrooge held on tight to his chair, to save himself from falling in a fit. \"Man of the worldly mind!\" replied the Ghost, \"do you believe in me or not?\" \"I do,\" said Scrooge. \"I must. But why do spirits walk the earth, and why do they come to me?\" \"It is required of every man,\" the Ghost returned, \"that the spirit within him should walk among his fellowmen, and travel far and wide; and if that spirit goes not forth in life, it is condemned to do so after death. It is doomed to wander through the world—oh, woe is me!—and witness what it cannot share, but might have shared on earth, and turned to happiness!\" Again the spectre raised a cry, and shook its chain, and wrung its shadowy hands. \"You are fettered,\" said Scrooge, trembling. \"Tell me why?\" \"I wear the chain I forged in life,\" replied the Ghost. \"I made it link by link, and yard by yard; I girded it on of my own free will, and of my own free will I wore it. Is its pattern strange to you?\" Scrooge trembled more and more. \"Or would you know,\" pursued the Ghost, \"the weight and length of the strong coil you bear yourself? It was full as heavy and as long as this, seven Christmas Eves ago. You have laboured on it, since. It is a ponderous chain!\" Scrooge glanced about him on the floor, in the expectation of finding himself surrounded by some fifty or sixty fathoms of iron cable; but he could see nothing. \"Jacob,\" he said"

The third upon the next night when the last stroke of Twelve has ceased to vibrate. Look to see me no more; and look that, for your own sake, you remember what has passed between us!”\nWhen it had said these words, the spectre took its wrapper from the table, and bound it round its head, as before. Scrooge knew this, by the smart sound its teeth made, when the jaws were brought together by the bandage. He ventured to raise his eyes again, and found his supernatural visitor confronting him in an erect attitude, with its chain wound over and about its arm.\nThe apparition walked backward from him; and at every step it took, the window raised itself a little, so that when the spectre reached it, it was wide open.\nIt beckoned Scrooge to approach, which he did. When they were within two paces of each other, Marley’s Ghost held up its hand, warning him to come no nearer. Scrooge stopped.\nNot so much in obedience, as in surprise and fear: for on the raising of the hand, he became sensible of confused noises in the air; incoherent sounds of lamentation and regret; wailings inexpressibly sorrowful and self-accusatory. The spectre, after listening for a moment, joined in the mournful dirge; and floated out upon the bleak, dark night.\nScrooge followed to the window: desperate in his curiosity.

MAJOR STRUCTURAL ISSUES:\n- In the middle section, the completion invents a new internal reaction for Scrooge, describing him as incredulous and fighting against his senses, which is not present in the original. This addition disrupts the flow and introduces a perspective not found in the source.\n- The completion also adds a speculative passage about the nature of the phantoms' voices and their despair, which is not part of the original text. This invented reflection alters the tone and content of the scene.\n- Near the end, the completion introduces several invented reasons for Scrooge's fatigue and need for rest, such as references to indigestible biscuit, cold, cramp, and bad digestion, which are not present in the original.\n\n2. MISSING ELEMENTS:\n- The completion omits the detail that some of the phantoms might be guilty governments and that some are linked together, which is a specific observation in the original.\n- The description of the ghost with the iron safe and its inability to help a woman and infant is present, but the completion does not clearly state that the misery of all the phantoms is their lost power to do good, as explicitly as the original does.\n- The transition describing whether the creatures faded into mist or were enshrouded by it is missing, as is the detail that the night became as it had been when Scrooge walked home.\n- The completion omits the detail that Scrooge examined the door by which the Ghost had entered and that the bolts were undisturbed.\n\n3. INACCURATE ELEMENTS:\n- The sequence of events is altered in the middle: Scrooge's action of going to the window is described as a separate, motivated act, rather than a direct follow-up to the ghost's departure.\n- The completion inaccurately attributes the act of entering to Scrooge when examining the door, rather than the Ghost.\n- The list of reasons for Scrooge's fatigue is inaccurate, as it includes invented causes and omits some from the original, and the order is changed.\n- The completion does not maintain the original's order of events in the closing actions, such as the examination of the door and the attempt to say \"Humbug!\""

He was endeavouring to pierce the darkness with his ferret eyes, when the chimes of a neighbouring church struck the four quarters. So he listened for the hour.\nTo his great astonishment the heavy bell went on from six to seven, and from seven to eight, and regularly up to twelve; then stopped. Twelve! It was past two when he went to bed. The clock was wrong. An icicle must have got into the works. Twelve!\nHe touched the spring of his repeater, to correct this most preposterous clock. Its rapid little pulse beat twelve: and stopped.\n“Why, it isn’t possible,” said Scrooge, “that I can have slept through a whole day and far into another night. It isn’t possible that anything has happened to the sun, and this is twelve at noon!”\nThe idea being an alarming one, he scrambled out of bed, and groped his way to the window. He was obliged to rub the frost off with the sleeve of his dressing-gown before he could see anything; and could see very little then. All he could make out was, that it was still very foggy and extremely cold, and that there was no noise of people running to and fro, and making a great stir, as there unquestionably would have been if night had beaten off bright day, and taken possession of the world. This was a great relief, because “three days after sight of this First of Exchange pay to Mr. Ebenezer Scrooge or his order,” and so forth, would have become a mere United States’ security if there were no days to count by.\nScrooge went to bed again, and thought, and thought, and thought it over and over and over, and could make nothing of it. The more he thought, the more perplexed he was; and the more he endeavoured not to think, the more he thought.\nMarley’s Ghost bothered him exceedingly. Every time he resolved within himself, after mature inquiry, that it was all a dream, his mind flew back again, like a strong spring released, to its first position, and presented the same problem to be worked all through, “Was it a dream or not?”\nScrooge lay in this state until the chime had gone three quarters more, when he remembered, on a sudden, that the Ghost had warned him of a visitation when the bell tolled one. He resolved to lie awake until the hour was passed; and, considering that he could no more go to sleep than go to Heaven, this was perhaps the wisest resolution in his power.\nThe quarter was so long, that he was more than once convinced he must have sunk into a doze unconsciously, and missed the clock. At length it broke upon his listening ear.",

Light flashed up in the room upon the instant, and the curtains of his bed were drawn.\nThe curtains of his bed were drawn aside, I tell you, by a hand. Not the curtains at his feet, nor the curtains at his back, but those to which his face was addressed. The curtains of his bed were drawn aside; and Scrooge, starting up into a half-recumbent attitude, found himself face to face with the unearthly visitor who drew them: as close to it as I am now to you, and I am standing in the spirit at your elbow.\nIt was a strange figure—like a child: yet not so like a child as like an old man, viewed through some supernatural medium, which gave him the appearance of having receded from the view, and being diminished to a child’s proportions. Its hair, which hung about its neck and down its back, was white as if with age; and yet the face had not a wrinkle in it, and the tenderest bloom was on the skin. The arms were very long and muscular; the hands the same, as if its hold were of uncommon strength. Its legs and feet, most delicately formed, were, like those upper members, bare. It wore a tunic of the purest white; and round its waist was bound a lustrous belt, the sheen of which was beautiful. It held a branch of fresh green holly in its hand; and, in singular contradiction of that wintry emblem, had its dress trimmed with summer flowers. But the strangest thing about it was, that from the crown of its head there sprung a bright clear jet of light, by which all this was visible; and which was doubtless the occasion of its using, in its duller moments, a great extinguisher for a cap, which it now held under its arm.\nEven this, though, when Scrooge looked at it with increasing steadiness, was not its strangest quality. For as its belt sparkled and glittered now in one part and now in another, and what was light one instant, at another time was dark, so the figure itself fluctuated in its distinctness: being now a thing with one arm, now with one leg, now with twenty legs, now a pair of legs without a head, now a head without a body: of which dissolving parts, no outline would be visible in the dense gloom wherein they melted away. And in the very wonder of this, it would be itself again; distinct and clear as ever.",

Its feet, observable beneath the ample folds of the garment, were also bare; and on its head it wore no other covering than a holly wreath, set here and there with shining icicles. Its dark brown curls were long and free; free as its genial face, its sparkling eyes, its open hand, its cheery voice, its unconstrained demeanour, and its joyful air. Girded round its middle was an antique scabbard; but no sword was in it, and the ancient sheath was eaten up with rust.\n\n“You have never seen the like of me before, I think?” inquired the Spirit.\n\n“Never,” Scrooge replied.\n\n“Have you had many brothers, Spirit?” asked Scrooge.\n\n“More than eighteen hundred,” said the Ghost.\n\n“A tremendous family to provide for!” muttered Scrooge.\n\nThe Ghost of Christmas Present rose.\n\n“Spirit,” said Scrooge submissively, “conduct me where you will.

The grasp, though gentle as a woman’s hand, was not to be resisted. He rose: but finding that the Spirit made towards the window, clasped his robe in supplication.\n“I am a mortal,” Scrooge remonstrated, “and liable to fall.”\n“Bear but a touch of my hand there,” said the Spirit, laying it upon his heart, “and you shall be upheld in more than this!”\nAs the words were spoken, they passed through the wall, and stood upon an open country road, with fields on either hand. The city had entirely vanished. Not a vestige of it was to be seen. The darkness and the mist had vanished with it, for it was a clear, cold, winter day, with snow upon the ground.\n“Good Heaven!” said Scrooge, clasping his hands together, as he looked about him. “I was bred in this place. I was a boy here!”\nThe Spirit gazed upon him mildly. Its gentle touch, though it had been light and instantaneous, appeared still present to the old man’s sense of feeling. He was conscious of a thousand odours floating in the air, each one connected with a thousand thoughts, and hopes, and joys, and cares long, long, forgotten!\n“Your lip is trembling,” said the Ghost. “And what is that upon your cheek?”\nScrooge muttered, with an unusual catching in his voice, that it was a pimple; and begged the Ghost to lead him where he would.\n“You recollect the way?” inquired the Spirit.\n“Remember it!” cried Scrooge with fervour; “I could walk it blindfold.”\n“Strange to have forgotten it for so many years!” observed the Ghost. “Let us go on.”\nThey walked along the road, Scrooge recognising every gate, and post, and tree; until a little market-town appeared in the distance, with its bridge, its church, and winding river. Some shaggy ponies now were seen trotting towards them with boys upon their backs, who called to other boys in country gigs and carts, driven by farmers. All these boys were in great spirits, and shouted to each other, until the broad fields were so full of merry music, that the crisp air laughed to hear it!\n“These are but shadows of the things that have been,” said the Ghost. “They have no consciousness of us.”\nThe jocund travellers came on; and as they came, Scrooge knew and named them every one. Why was he rejoiced beyond all bounds to see them! Why did his cold eye glisten, and his heart leap up as they went past! Why was he filled with gladness when he heard them give each other Merry Christmas, as they parted at cross-roads and bye-ways, for their several homes! What was merry Christmas to Scrooge? Out upon merry Christmas! What good had it ever done to him?\n“The school is not quite deserted,” said the Ghost. “A solitary child, neglected by his friends, is left there still.”\nScrooge said he knew it. And he sobbed.\nThey left the high-road, by a well-remembered lane, and soon approached a mansion of dull red brick, with a little weathercock-surmounted cupola, on the roof, and a bell hanging in it. It was a large house, but one of broken fortunes; for the spacious offices were little used, their walls were damp and mossy, their windows broken, and their gates decayed. Fowls clucked and strutted in the stables; and the coach-houses and sheds were over-run with grass. Nor was it more retentive of its ancient state, within; for entering the dreary hall, and glancing through the open doors of many rooms, they found them poorly furnished, cold, and vast. There was an earthy savour in the air, a chilly bareness in the place, which associated itself somehow with too much getting up by candle-light, and not too much to eat.\nThey went, the Ghost and Scrooge, across the hall, to a door at the back of the house. It opened before them, and disclosed a long, bare, melancholy room, made barer still by lines of plain deal forms and desks. At one of these a lonely boy was reading near a feeble fire; and Scrooge sat down upon a form, and wept to see his poor forgotten self as he used to be.\nNot a latent echo in the house, not a squeak and scuffle from the mice behind the panelling, not a drip from the half-thawed water-spout in the dull yard behind, not a sigh among the leafless boughs of one despondent poplar, not the idle swinging of an empty store-house door, no, not a clicking in the fire, but fell upon the heart of Scrooge with a softening influence, and gave a freer passage to his tears.\nThe Spirit touched him on the arm, and pointed to his younger self, intent upon his reading. Suddenly a man, in foreign garments: wonderfully real and distinct to look at: stood outside the window, with an axe stuck in his belt, and leading by the bridle an ass laden with wood.\n“Why, it’s Ali Baba!” Scrooge exclaimed in ecstasy. “It’s dear old honest Ali Baba! Yes, yes, I know! One Christmas time, when yonder solitary child was left here all alone, he did come, for the first time, just like that. Poor boy! And Valentine,” said Scrooge, “and his wild brother, Orson; there they go! And what’s his name, who was put down in his drawers, asleep, at the Gate of Damascus; don’t you see him! And the Sultan’s Groom turned upside down by the Genii; there he is upon his head! Serve him right. I’m glad of it. What business had he to be married to the Princess!”\nTo hear Scrooge expending all the earnestness of his nature on such subjects, in a most extraordinary voice between laughing and crying; and to see his heightened and excited face; would have been a surprise to his business friends in the city, indeed.\n“There’s the Parrot!” cried Scrooge. “Green body and yellow tail, with a thing like a lettuce growing out of the top of his head; there he is! Poor Robin Crusoe, he called him, when he came home again after sailing round the island. ‘Poor Robin Crusoe, where have you been, Robin Crusoe?’ The man thought he was dreaming, but he wasn’t. It was the Parrot, you know. There goes Friday, running for his life to the little creek! Halloa! Hoop! Halloo!”\nThen, with a rapidity of transition very foreign to his usual character, he said, in pity for his former self, “Poor boy!” and cried again.\n“I wish,” Scrooge muttered, putting his hand in his pocket, and looking about him, after drying his eyes with his cuff: “but it’s too late now.”\n“What is the matter?” asked the Spirit.\n“Nothing,” said Scrooge. “Nothing. There was a boy singing a Christmas Carol at my door last night. I should like to have given him something: that’s all.”",

There was nothing they could have done together in the way of travelling, from his waistcoat-button to his shoe-tie, that would have been half so difficult as standing still. He was not an unmoved observer of this ghostly phenomenon, and when he came, he did not pause, but held him in his hand: Scrooge felt the pressure of its fingers, as if he had been a thing of iron. He would have walked through a wall very easily; it was not more difficult to him than it was to go, and he did go. As they stood together on the threshold of the door, the Spirit smiled, and bade Scrooge enter. It was a strange figure—like a child: yet not so like a child as like an old man, viewed through some supernatural medium, which gave him the appearance of having receded from the view, and being diminished to a child’s proportions. Its hair, which hung about its neck and down its back, was white as if with age; and yet the face had not a wrinkle in it, and the tenderest bloom was on the skin. The arms were very long and muscular; the hands the same, as if its hold were of uncommon strength. Its legs and feet, most delicately formed, were, like the arms, bare. It wore a tunic of the purest white; and round its waist was bound a lustrous belt, the sheen of which was beautiful. It held a branch of fresh green holly in its hand; and, in singular contradiction of that wintry emblem, had its dress trimmed with summer flowers. But the strangest thing about it was, that from the crown of its head there sprung a bright clear jet of light, by which all this was visible; and which was doubtless the occasion of its using, in its duller moments, a great extinguisher for a cap, which it held under its arm. Even this, though, when Scrooge looked at it with increasing steadiness, was not its strangest quality. For as he looked, its form fluctuated in its distinctness: being now a thing with one arm, now with one leg, now with twenty legs, now a pair of legs without a head, now this, now that, and spreading out into a thin mist, until they could see it no longer, and then condensing into its original shape. ‘Are you the Spirit, sir, whose coming was foretold to me?’ asked Scrooge. ‘I am.’ ‘Who, and what are you?’ demanded Scrooge. ‘I am the Ghost of Christmas Past.’ ‘Long Past?’ inquired Scrooge: observant of its dwarfish stature. ‘No. Your Past.’ Perhaps, if Scrooge had been less covetous, he would have thought more of his own fatherless condition, and less of the spirits that had been his partners in the business. He might have been inclined to find some excuse for his present state of mind in the circumstances of his youth. But he had never done so, and he was not disposed to begin now. ‘What business brought you here?’ asked Scrooge. ‘Your welfare,’ said the Ghost. Scrooge expressed himself much obliged, but could not help thinking that a night of unbroken rest would have been more conducive to that end. The Spirit must have heard him thinking, for it said immediately: ‘Your reclamation, then. Take heed!’ It put out its strong hand as it spoke, and clasped him gently by the arm. ‘Rise! and walk with me!’ ‘I am a mortal,’ Scrooge remonstrated, ‘and liable to fall.’ ‘Bear but a touch of my hand there,’ said the Spirit, laying it upon his heart, ‘and you shall be upheld in more than this!’ As the words were spoken, they passed through the wall, and stood upon an open country road, with fields on either hand.

Fowls clucked and strutted in the stables; and the coach-house and sheds were overrun with grass. Nor was it more inviting inside. Gloomy corridors, and long rows of dismal chambers, were black with mildew, and decay. The very light and air seemed to have deserted them, and settled down upon the earth. As they approached the door, they saw a boy, who was reading near a feeble fire; and Scrooge sat down upon a form, and wept to see his poor forgotten self as he used to be. Not a latent echo in the house, not a squeak and scuffle from the mice behind the panelling, not a drip from the half-thawed water-spout in the dull yard behind, not a sigh among the leafless branches of the melancholy poplar tree, but fell upon the heart of Scrooge with a softening influence, and gave a freer passage to his tears. The Spirit touched him on the arm, and pointed to the window. There his former self lay all alone, upon a neglected couch, reading by a fire. And he was not reading the biography of a first-class clergyman, or a distinguished manufacturer; he was reading. The Ghost smiled thoughtfully, and waved its hand: saying as it did so, ‘Look, upon the screen!’ Scrooge looked, and saw a perfect procession of the characters he remembered in his child-hood. Ali Baba was there! leaning against a chimney, and smiling with a sword in his hand. There was the Parrot! not green and yellow, but a macaw, in a cage outside the window. There was Robinson Crusoe, with his long hair, and his goat-skin cap, and his umbrella; and Friday, running to meet him; and all the rest of the crowd, as they were in the book. By the Lord, they were a glorious sight! And Scrooge, familiar with their every look, and every line, was filled with a delight, with a boyish eagerness, that he had long forgotten. ‘Why, there’s the Parrot!’ cried Scrooge. ‘Green and yellow, ragged, and",

Take heed!’ It put out its strong hand as it spoke, and clasped him gently by the arm. ‘Rise! and walk with me!’ ‘I am a mortal,’ Scrooge remonstrated, ‘and liable to fall.’ ‘Bear but a touch of my hand there,’ said the Spirit, laying it upon his heart, ‘and you shall be upheld in more than this!’ As the words were spoken, they passed through the wall, and stood upon an open country road, with fields on either hand. The city had entirely vanished. Not a vestige of it was to be seen. The darkness and the mist had vanished with it, for it was a clear, cold, winter day, with snow upon the ground. ‘Good Heaven!’ said Scrooge, clasping his hands together, as he looked about him. ‘I was bred in this place. I was a boy here!’ The Spirit looked upon him mildly. Its gentle touch, though it had been light and instantaneous, appeared still present to the old man’s sense of feeling. He was conscious of a thousand odours floating in the air, each one connected with a thousand thoughts, and hopes, and joys, and cares long, long, forgotten! ‘Your lip is trembling,’ said the Ghost. ‘And what is that upon your cheek?’ Scrooge muttered, with an unusual catching in his voice, that it was a pimple, and begged the Ghost to lead him where he would. ‘You recollect the way?’ inquired the Spirit. ‘Remember it!’ cried Scrooge with fervour; ‘I could walk it blindfold.’ ‘Strange to have forgotten it for so many years!’ observed the Ghost. ‘Let us go on.’ They walked along the road, Scrooge recognising every gate, and post, and tree; until a little market-town appeared in the distance, with its bridge, its church, and winding river. Some shaggy ponies now were seen trotting towards them with boys upon their backs, who called to other boys in country gigs and carts, driven by farmers. All these boys were in great spirits, and shouted to each other, until the broad fields were so full of merry sound, that the crisp air laughed to hear it. ‘These are but shadows of the things that have been,’ said the Ghost. ‘They have no consciousness of us.’ The jocund travellers came on; and as they came, Scrooge knew and named them every one. Why was he filled with gladness when he heard them give each other Merry Christmas, as they parted at cross-roads and bye-ways, for their several homes? What was merry Christmas to Scrooge? Out upon merry Christmas! What good had it ever done to him? ‘The school is not quite deserted,’ said the Ghost. ‘A solitary child, neglected by his friends, is left there still.’ Scrooge said he knew it. And he sobbed. They left the high-road, by a well-remembered lane, and soon approached a mansion of dull red brick, with a little weathercock-surmounted cupola on the roof, and a bell hanging in it. It was a large house, but one of broken fortunes; for the spacious offices were little used, their walls were damp and mossy, their windows broken, and their gates decayed. Fowls clucked and strutted in the stables; and the coach-house and sheds were overrun with grass. Nor was it more inviting inside. Gloomy corridors, and long rows of dismal chambers, were black with mildew, and decay. The very light and air seemed to have deserted them, and settled down upon the earth. As they approached the door, they saw a boy, who was reading near a feeble fire; and Scrooge sat down upon a form, and wept to see his poor forgotten self as he used to be. Not a latent echo in the house, not a squeak and scuffle from the mice behind the panelling, not a drip from the half-thawed water-spout in the dull yard behind, not a sigh among the leafless branches of the melancholy poplar tree, but fell upon the heart of Scrooge with a softening influence, and gave a freer passage to his tears. The Spirit touched him on the arm, and pointed to the window. There his former self lay all alone, upon a neglected couch, reading by a fire. And he was not reading the biography of a first-class clergyman, or a distinguished manufacturer; he was reading. The Ghost smiled thoughtfully, and waved its hand: saying as it did so, ‘Look, upon the screen!’ Scrooge looked, and saw a perfect procession of the characters he remembered in his child-hood. Ali Baba was there! leaning against a chimney, and smiling with a sword in his hand. There was the Parrot! not green and yellow, but a macaw, in a cage outside the window. There was Robinson Crusoe, with his long hair, and his goat-skin cap, and his umbrella; and Friday, running to meet him; and all the rest of the crowd, as they were in the book. By the Lord, they were a glorious sight! And Scrooge, familiar with their every look, and every line, was filled with a delight, with a boyish eagerness, that he had long forgotten. ‘Why, there’s the Parrot!’ cried Scrooge. ‘Green and yellow, ragged, and",

            "prefix-probing": "It would have been in vain for Scrooge to plead that the weather and the hour were not adapted to pedestrian purposes; that bed was warm, and the thermometer a long way below freezing; that he was clad but lightly in his slippers, dressing-gown, and nightcap; and that he had a cold upon him at that time. There was no pleading, however, for he found himself face to face with the spectral figure, no longer in his own bedroom, but in an adjoining room, his own, but undergoing a surprising transformation. The walls and ceiling were so hung with living green, that it looked a perfect grove; from every part of which, bright gleaming berries glistened. The crisp leaves of holly, mistletoe, and ivy reflected back the light, as if so many little mirrors had been scattered there; and such a mighty blaze went roaring up the chimney, as that it was an Alaskan furnace. Heaped up on the floor, to form a kind of throne, were turkeys, geese, game, poultry, brawn, great joints of meat, sucking-pigs, long wreaths of sausages, mince-pies, plum-puddings, barrels of oysters, red-hot chestnuts, cherry-cheeked apples, juicy oranges, luscious pears, immense twelfth-cakes, and seething bowls of punch, that made the chamber dim with their delicious steam. In easy state upon this couch, there sat a jolly Giant, glorious to see; who bore a glowing torch, in shape not unlike Plenty’s horn, and held it up, high up, to shed its light on Scrooge, as he came peeping round the door. Scrooge entered timidly, and hung his head before this Spirit. He was not the dogged Scrooge he had been; and though the Spirit’s eyes were clear and kind, he did not like to meet them. ‘Spirit,’ said Scrooge submissively, ‘conduct me where you will. I went forth last night on compulsion, and I learnt a lesson which is working now. To-night, if you have aught to teach me, let me profit by it.’ ‘Touch my robe!’ The Spirit said. Scrooge did as he was told, and held it fast. Holly, mistletoe, red berries, ivy, turkeys, geese, game, poultry, brawn, meat, pigs, sausages, oysters, pies, puddings, punch, and apples, appeared to vanish instantly. So did the room, the fire, the ruddy glow, the hour of night, and they stood in the city streets, on Christmas morning, where it was snowing, heavily. The people who were shovelling away on the housetops were jovial and full of glee; calling out to one another from the parapets, and now and then exchanging a facetious snowball—better-natured missile far than many a wordy jest—laughing heartily if it went right, and not less heartily if it went wrong. The poulterers’ shops were still half open, and the fruiterers’ were radiant in their glory. There were great heaps of fat, brown turkeys, speckled geese, long lines of sausages, and at the end of them, the plump and juicy ducks. The grocers’ remained open, their windows a blaze of light, with currants, raisins, almonds, figs, sugar, and all the ingredients of Christmas puddings, piled high. The air was filled with the scent of roasting meat and the sweet smell of oranges and lemons. Even the bakers’ shops were open, and there the poor might take their Christmas dinners of goose or turkey to be baked, paying a few pence for the service. It was a cheerful sight to see them, as they went along the streets with their burdens, and a pretty game to look down into the bakers’ shops, and see the pies and puddings going in and out, and the batches of bread. The Spirit stood beside him, and diffused a genial light. It was not Himself he shed it from, but from his torch. And as the bearers of the dinners came to the corners, he would stop and shed a few drops of water from the torch on them, and they would go on their way rejoicing. For it was a special quality of this torch, that it was of the essence of Christmas; and from it, all good cheer and warmth seemed to flow. They went on, invisible, as they had been before, into the suburbs of the town. It was a long walk, and Scrooge was glad of it. He felt the Spirit’s power, and its kindness. They passed a little house, with a patched-up door, and a broken window-pane. Scrooge knew it well. It was the home of Bob Cratchit, his clerk. The Spirit smiled, and stopped. ‘This is the place,’ said the Spirit. They went in. It was a very small house indeed. There was a little fire in the grate; and Bob Cratchit’s wife, dressed but poorly in a twice-turned gown, but brave in ribbons, sat mending a threadbare shirt. Her daughter, Belinda, assisted by Master Peter Cratchit, plunged a fork into the saucepan of potatoes, and mashed them with incredible vigour. ‘What has ever got your precious father then?’ said Mrs. Cratchit. ‘And your brother, Tiny Tim? And Martha warn’t as late last Christmas Day by half-an-hour!’ ‘Here’s Martha, mother!’ cried a girl, appearing as she spoke. ‘Here’s Martha, mother!’ said the two young Cratchits. ‘Hurrah! There’s such a goose, Martha!’ ‘Why, bless your heart alive, my dear, how late you are!’ said Mrs. Cratchit, kissing her a dozen times, and taking off her shawl and bonnet for her. ‘We’d a deal of work to finish up last night,’ replied the girl, ‘and had to clear away this morning, mother!’ ‘Well! Never mind, so long as you are come,’ said Mrs. Cratchit. ‘Sit ye down before the fire, my dear, and have a warm, Lord bless ye!’ ‘No, no! There’s father coming"

The panels shrunk, the windows cracked; fragments of plaster fell out of the ceiling, and the naked laths were shown instead; but how all this was brought about, Scrooge knew no more than you do. He only knew that it was quite correct; that everything had happened so; that there he was, alone again, when all the other boys had gone home for the jolly holidays.\nHe was not reading now, but walking up and down despairingly. Scrooge looked at the Ghost, and with a mournful shaking of his head, glanced anxiously towards the door.\nIt opened; and a little girl, much younger than the boy, came darting in, and putting her arms about his neck, and often kissing him, addressed him as her “Dear, dear brother.”\n“I have come to bring you home, dear brother!” said the child, clapping her tiny hands, and bending down to laugh. “To bring you home, home, home!”\n“Home, little Fan?” returned the boy.\n“Yes!” said the child, brimful of glee. “Home, for good and all. Home, for ever and ever. Father is so much kinder than he used to be, that home’s like Heaven! He spoke so gently to me one dear night when I was going to bed, that I was not afraid to ask him once more if you might come home; and he said Yes, you should; and sent me in a coach to bring you. And you’re to be a man!” said the child, opening her eyes, “and are never to come back here; but first, we’re to be together all the Christmas long, and have the merriest time in all the world.”\n“You are quite a woman, little Fan!” exclaimed the boy.\nShe clapped her hands and laughed, and tried to touch his head; but being too little, laughed again, and stood on tiptoe to embrace him. Then she began to drag him, in her childish eagerness, towards the door; and he, nothing loth to go, accompanied her.\nA terrible voice in the hall cried, “Bring down Master Scrooge’s box, there!” and in the hall appeared the schoolmaster himself, who glared on Master Scrooge with a ferocious condescension, and threw him into a dreadful state of mind by shaking hands with him. He then conveyed him and his sister into the veriest old well of a shivering best-parlour that ever was seen, where the maps upon the wall, and the celestial and terrestrial globes in the windows, were waxy with cold. Here he produced a decanter of curiously light wine, and a block of curiously heavy cake, and administered instalments of those dainties to the young people: at the same time, sending out a meagre servant to offer a glass of “something” to the postboy, who answered that he thanked the gentleman, but if it was the same tap as he had tasted before, he had rather not. Master Scrooge’s trunk being by this time tied on to the top of the chaise, the children bade the schoolmaster good-bye right willingly; and getting into it, drove gaily down the garden-sweep: the quick wheels dashing the hoar-frost and snow from off the dark leaves of the evergreens like spray.\n“Always a delicate creature, whom a breath might have withered,” said the Ghost. “But she had a large heart!”\n“So she had,” cried Scrooge. “You’re right. I will not gainsay it, Spirit. God forbid!”\n“She died a woman,” said the Ghost, “and had, as I think, children.”\n“One child,” Scrooge returned.\n“True,” said the Ghost. “Your nephew!”\nScrooge seemed uneasy in his mind; and answered briefly, “Yes.”",

MAJOR STRUCTURAL ISSUES:\n- The completion introduces invented scenes and descriptions early on, such as a room decorated with greenery and references to holly, mistletoe, and berries, which do not appear in the original passage at this point.\n- There is a significant omission of the entire sequence involving the arrival of the little girl, her interaction with the boy, and the emotional reunion, which is a central part of the original.\n- The completion lacks the subsequent events involving the schoolmaster, the serving of refreshments, the departure, and the conversation between the Ghost and Scrooge about the girl’s fate and her child.\n- The text devolves into a repetitive, nonsensical loop about Scrooge being a boy again, which does not correspond to any part of the original and disrupts the narrative flow.\n\n2. MISSING ELEMENTS:\n- The transformation of the room into a darker, more dilapidated state is not described.\n- The emotional state and actions of Scrooge’s former self, such as walking in despair and glancing at the door, are omitted.\n- The entrance and affectionate greeting of the younger girl, her dialogue, and the explanation for Scrooge’s return home are missing.\n- The sequence of events involving the schoolmaster, the serving of food and drink, and the children’s departure is entirely absent.\n- The reflective conversation between the Ghost and Scrooge about the girl’s later life and her child is not included.\n\n3. INACCURATE ELEMENTS:\n- The setting is inaccurately described with festive decorations and a lively atmosphere, which does not match the original’s somber and deteriorating environment.\n- The sequence of events is incorrect, with invented actions and settings replacing the actual narrative progression.\n- The completion repeats a single idea excessively, which is not present in the original and results in a loss of narrative coherence.\n- There is no mention of the key relationships and emotional exchanges that are central to the original passage.\n\nTo improve, focus on accurately following the sequence of events, including all major interactions and transformations, and avoid inventing or repeating content that is not present in the source material."

It was made plain enough, by the dressing of the shops, that here too it was Christmas time again; but it was evening, and the streets were lighted up.\nThe Ghost stopped at a certain warehouse door, and asked Scrooge if he knew it.\n“Know it!” said Scrooge. “Was I apprenticed here!”\nThey went in. At sight of an old gentleman in a Welsh wig, sitting behind such a high desk, that if he had been two inches taller he must have knocked his head against the ceiling, Scrooge cried in great excitement:\n“Why, it’s old Fezziwig! Bless his heart; it’s Fezziwig alive again!”\nOld Fezziwig laid down his pen, and looked up at the clock, which pointed to the hour of seven. He rubbed his hands; adjusted his capacious waistcoat; laughed all over himself, from his shoes to his organ of benevolence; and called out in a comfortable, oily, rich, fat, jovial voice:\n“Yo ho, there! Ebenezer! Dick!”\nScrooge’s former self, now grown a young man, came briskly in, accompanied by his fellow-’prentice.\n“Dick Wilkins, to be sure!” said Scrooge to the Ghost. “Bless me, yes. There he is. He was very much attached to me, was Dick. Poor Dick! Dear, dear!”\n“Yo ho, my boys!” said Fezziwig. “No more work to-night. Christmas Eve, Dick. Christmas, Ebenezer! Let’s have the shutters up,” cried old Fezziwig, with a sharp clap of his hands, “before a man can say Jack Robinson!”\nYou wouldn’t believe how those two fellows went at it! They charged into the street with the shutters—one, two, three—had ’em up in their places—four, five, six—barred ’em and pinned ’em—seven, eight, nine—and came back before you could have got to twelve, panting like race-horses.\n“Hilli-ho!” cried old Fezziwig, skipping down from the high desk, with wonderful agility. “Clear away, my lads, and let’s have lots of room here! Hilli-ho, Dick! Chirrup, Ebenezer!”\nClear away! There was nothing they wouldn’t have cleared away, or couldn’t have cleared away, with old Fezziwig looking on. It was done in a minute. Every movable was packed off, as if it were dismissed from public life for evermore; the floor was swept and watered, the lamps were trimmed, fuel was heaped upon the fire; and the warehouse was as snug, and warm, and dry, and bright a ball-room, as you would desire to see upon a winter’s night.\nIn came a fiddler with a music-book, and went up to the lofty desk, and made an orchestra of it, and tuned like fifty stomach-aches. In came Mrs. Fezziwig, one vast substantial smile. In came the three Miss Fezziwigs, beaming and lovable. In came the six young followers whose hearts they broke. In came all the young men and women employed in the business. In came the housemaid, with her cousin, the baker. In came the cook, with her brother’s particular friend, the milkman. In came the boy from over the way, who was suspected of not having board enough from his master; trying to hide himself behind the girl from next door but one, who was proved to have had her ears pulled by her mistress. In they all came, one after another; some shyly, some boldly, some gracefully, some awkwardly, some pushing, some pulling; in they all came, anyhow and everyhow. Away they all went, twenty couple at once; hands half round and back again the other way; down the middle and up again; round and round in various stages of affectionate grouping; old top couple always turning up in the wrong place; new top couple starting off again, as soon as they got there; all top couples at last, and not a bottom one to help them! When this result was brought about, old Fezziwig, clapping his hands to stop the dance, cried out, “Well done!” and the fiddler plunged his hot face into a pot of porter, especially provided for that purpose. But scorning rest, upon his reappearance, he instantly began again, though there were no dancers yet, as if the other fiddler had been carried home, exhausted, on a shutter, and he were a bran-new man resolved to beat him out of sight, or perish.\nThere were more dances, and there were forfeits, and more dances, and there was cake, and there was negus, and there was a great piece of Cold Roast, and there was a great piece of Cold Boiled, and there were mince-pies, and plenty of beer. But the great effect of the evening came after the Roast and Boiled, when the fiddler (an artful dog, mind! The sort of man who knew his business better than you or I could have told it him!) struck up “Sir Roger de Coverley.” Then old Fezziwig stood out to dance with Mrs. Fezziwig. Top couple, too; with a good stiff piece of work cut out for them; three or four and twenty pair of partners; people who were not to be trifled with; people who would dance, and had no notion of walking.\nBut if they had been twice as many—ah, four times—old Fezziwig would have been a match for them, and so would Mrs. Fezziwig. As to her, she was worthy to be his partner in every sense of the term. If that’s not high praise, tell me higher, and I’ll use it. A positive light appeared to issue from Fezziwig’s calves. They shone in every part of the dance like moons. You couldn’t have predicted, at any given time, what would have become of them next. And when old Fezziwig and Mrs. Fezziwig had gone all through the dance; advance and retire, both hands to your partner, bow and curtsey, corkscrew, thread-the-needle, and back again to your place; Fezziwig “cut”—cut so deftly, that he appeared to wink with his legs, and came upon his feet again without a stagger.\nWhen the clock struck eleven, this domestic ball broke up. Mr. and Mrs. Fezziwig took their stations, one on either side of the door, and shaking hands with every person individually as he or she went out, wished him or her a Merry Christmas. When everybody had retired but the two ’prentices, they did the same to them; and thus the cheerful voices died away, and the lads were left to their beds; which were under a counter in the back-shop.\nDuring the whole of this time, Scrooge had acted like a man out of his wits. His heart and soul were in the scene, and with his former self. He corroborated everything, remembered everything, enjoyed everything, and underwent the strangest agitation. It was not until now, when the bright faces of his former self and Dick were turned from them, that he remembered the Ghost, and became conscious that it was looking full upon him, while the light upon its head burnt very clear.\n“A small matter,” said the Ghost, “to make these silly folks so full of gratitude.”\n“Small!” echoed Scrooge.\nThe Spirit signed to him to listen to the two apprentices, who were pouring out their hearts in praise of Fezziwig: and when he had done so, said,\n“Why! Is it not? He has spent but a few pounds of your mortal money: three or four perhaps. Is that so much that he deserves this praise?”\n“It isn’t that,” said Scrooge, heated by the remark, and speaking unconsciously like his former, not his latter, self. “It isn’t that, Spirit. He has the power to render us happy or unhappy; to make our service light or burdensome; a pleasure or a toil. Say that his power lies in words and looks; in things so slight and insignificant that it is impossible to add and count ’em up: what then? The happiness he gives, is quite as great as if it cost a fortune.”\nHe felt the Spirit’s glance, and stopped.\n“What is the matter?” asked the Ghost.\n“Nothing particular,” said Scrooge.\n“Something, I think?” the Ghost insisted.\n“No,” said Scrooge, “No. I should like to be able to say a word or two to my clerk just now. That’s all.”",

It was strange to Scrooge, standing in the Spirit’s light, to be conscious of a change in himself, and now to see himself as he had been when this was going on. He was a boy again. He was not alone, but had a fellow-apprentice with him: a boy from the country, who was lonesome, but not so lonesome as he would have been; for they were great friends. They stood together, looking down into the street. The Spirit stopped beside it, and bade Scrooge observe the entrance to the court. It was a great house, but now in a wretched state of dilapidation. He looked down the court and back at the Ghost, and with a mournful shaking of his head, glanced down again. He knew the place. ‘Know it!’ said the Spirit. ‘Was this where you were apprenticed?’ ‘Yes,’ said Scrooge. ‘Old Fezziwig lived here, and was in the warehouse. It is a strange thing,’ said Scrooge, ‘that I should have forgotten it for so many years!’ He was about to say more, when the Spirit stopped him. ‘Let us see the place as it was,’ said the Spirit, and instantly they were in the warehouse. It was not large, but it was well supplied with goods. It was a place of business, but it was also a place of pleasure. It was a place where Scrooge had been happy. He saw old Fezziwig, sitting behind a high desk, wearing a Welsh wig, and rubbing his hands; his face was broad, and his eyes twinkled. He was a large man, with a large heart. ‘Bless me!’ cried Scrooge, in an ecstasy. ‘It’s old Fezziwig! Bless his heart; it’s Fezziwig alive again!’ Old Fezziwig laid down his pen, and looked up at the clock, which pointed to the hour of seven. He rubbed his hands, adjusted his capacious waistcoat, laughed in a hearty, jovial fashion that made his belt buckle shake again, and called out in a comfortable, oily, rich, fat, jovial voice: ‘Yo ho, there! Ebenezer! Dick!’ Scrooge’s former self, now a young man, came briskly in, accompanied by his fellow-apprentice, Dick Wilkins. ‘Dick Wilkins, to be sure!’ said Scrooge to the Spirit. ‘Bless me, yes. There he is. He was very much attached to me, was Dick. Poor Dick!’ ‘Yo ho, my boys!’ said Fezziwig. ‘No more work to-night. Christmas Eve, Dick. Christmas Eve, Ebenezer! Let’s have the shutters up,’ cried old Fezziwig, with a sharp clap of his hands, ‘before a man can say Jack Robinson!’ You wouldn’t believe how they did it. They went at it with a will, and they did it with a will. They were young and strong, and they were full of life. They were full of the spirit of Christmas. They were full of the spirit of Fezziwig. They were full of the spirit of their master. They were full of the spirit of their work. They were full of the spirit of their play. They were full of the spirit of their youth.

                "text": "Although they had but that moment left the school behind them, they were now in the busy thoroughfares of a city, where shadowy passengers passed and repassed; where shadowy carts and coaches battled for the way, and all the strife and tumult of a real city were. It was strange to Scrooge, standing in the Spirit’s light, to be conscious of a change in himself, and now to see himself as he had been when this was going on. He was a boy again, a solitary boy, sitting by the fire. And he wept to see his poor forgotten self as he used to be. The Spirit signed to him to listen to the carol sung by the boy at the door. It was a simple tune, but he knew it well, and at the first sound of it, his voice failed him, and he sobbed. The Ghost of Christmas Past led him through the streets of the town. He saw the Christmas time in the shops, where the shutters were up, and the lights were burning brightly. He saw the Christmas time in the houses, where the windows were bright with the light of fires, and the sounds of music and dancing came out into the street. He saw the Christmas time in the hearts of the people, who were hurrying to and fro, with smiling faces and kind words. He saw the Christmas time in the air, which was cold and clear, and full of the sound of bells. He saw the Christmas time in the sky, which was dark and starry, and full of the promise of snow. He saw the Christmas time everywhere, and he felt it in his heart. The Spirit stopped at a warehouse door, and asked Scrooge if he knew it. ‘Know it!’ said Scrooge. ‘Was I apprenticed here?’ They went in. At sight of an old gentleman in a Welsh wig, sitting behind a high desk, Scrooge cried in great excitement: ‘Why, it’s old Fezziwig! Bless his heart; it’s Fezziwig alive again!’ Old Fezziwig laid down his pen, and looked up at the clock, which pointed to the hour of seven. He rubbed his hands, adjusted his capacious waistcoat, laughed in a hearty, jovial fashion that made his belt buckle shake again, and called out in a comfortable, oily, rich, fat, jovial voice: ‘Yo ho, there!

There he is. He was very much attached to me, was Dick. Poor Dick!’ ‘Yo ho, my boys!’ said Fezziwig. ‘No more work to-night. Christmas Eve, Dick. Christmas Eve, Ebenezer! Let’s have the shutters up,’ cried old Fezziwig, with a sharp clap of his hands, ‘before a man can say Jack Robinson!’ You wouldn’t believe how they did it. They were down in a jiffy. Half a minute, and the shutters were up, and the window barred, and the door fastened, and they were back again with a breath to spare. ‘Hilli-ho!’ cried old Fezziwig, skipping down from the high desk, with wonderful agility. ‘Clear away, my lads! Clear away, Ebenezer! Clear away, Dick! Hilli-ho, clear away!’ There was nothing they wouldn’t have cleared away, or couldn’t have cleared away, with old Fezziwig looking on. It was done in a minute. Every movable thing was packed off, as if it were dismissed from public life for evermore. The floor was swept and watered, the lamps were trimmed, fuel was heaped upon the fire; and the warehouse was as snug, and warm, and dry, and bright a ball-room, as you would desire to see upon the merriest Christmas Eve. In came a fiddler with a music-book, and went up to the lofty desk, and made an orchestra of it, and tuned like fifty stomach-aches. In came Mrs. Fezziwig, one vast substantial smile. In came the three Miss Fezziwigs, beaming and lovable. In came the six young followers whose hearts they broke. In came all the young men and women employed in the business. In came the housemaid, with her cousin, the baker. In came the cook, with her brother’s particular friend, the milkman. In came the boy from over the way, who was suspected of not having board enough from his master; trying to hide himself behind the girl from next door but one, who was proved to have had her ears pulled by her mistress. In they all came, one after another; some shyly, some boldly, some gracefully, some awkwardly, some pushing, some pulling; in they all came, anyhow and everyhow. Away they all went, twenty couple at once, hands half round and back again the other way; down the middle and up again; figures of eight, and right and left; cutting, and shuffling, and plaiting, and weaving in and out; taking their turns of footing it, and all the time the fiddler playing his mightiest, as if he were trying to peel the plaster off the ceiling. There were more dances, and there were forfeits, and there was cake, and there was negus, and there was a great piece of Cold Roast, and there was a great piece of Boiled, and there were mince-pies, and there was beer. But the great effect of the evening came after the Roast and Boiled, when the fiddler (an artful dog, mind! The sort of man who knew his business better than you or I could have taught it him!) struck up ‘Sir Roger de Coverley.’ Then old Fezziwig stood out to dance with Mrs. Fezziwig. Top couple, too; with a good stiff piece of work cut out for them; three or four and twenty pair of partners; people who were not to be trifled with; people who would dance, and had no notion of standing. But if they had been twice as many—ah, four times—old Fezziwig would have been a match for them, and so would Mrs. Fezziwig. As to her, she was worthy to be his partner in every sense of the term. If that’s not high praise, tell me higher, and I’ll write it down. A positive light appeared to issue from Fezziwig’s calves. They shone in every part of the dance. You couldn’t have hid a shilling in the folds of his waistcoat; and at the same time you might have feasted a whole regiment of soldiers upon it, if they could have kept their mouths off it, when they saw the size of it. His legs were a spectacle. His dances were a wonder. He could have danced all night, and gone to bed next morning fresh as a daisy, if he had thought fit to do it. And Fezziwig stood out to dance with Mrs. Fezziwig. When the clock struck eleven, this domestic ball broke up. Mr. and Mrs. Fezziwig took their stations, one on either side of the door, and shaking hands with every person individually as he or she went out, wished him or her a Merry Christmas. When everybody had retired but the two apprentices, they did the same to them; and went to bed. During the whole of this time, Scrooge had acted like a man out of his wits. His heart and soul were in the scene, and with his former self. He corroborated everything, remembered everything, enjoyed everything, and underwent the strangest agitation. It was not until now, when the bright faces of his former self and Dick were turned from them, that he remembered the Ghost, and became conscious that it was looking full upon him, and had observed all that passed",

And yet these forms were not those of strangers. Scrooge had been bred in this place. He knew it well. The Ghost stopped at a certain warehouse door, and asked Scrooge if he knew it. It was a large old building, with offices on the ground floor, and lofts above, where merchandise was stored. It was a place of business, and a busy one. Scrooge said he knew it. It was where he had been apprenticed. They went in. At sight of an old gentleman in a Welsh wig, sitting behind a high desk, Scrooge cried out in a transport, 'Why, it's old Fezziwig!

For again Scrooge saw himself. He was older now; a man in the prime of life. His face had not the harsh and rigid lines of later years; but it had begun to wear the signs of care and avarice. There was an eager, greedy, restless motion in the eye, which showed the passion that had taken root, and where the shadow of the growing tree would fall.\nHe was not alone, but sat by the side of a fair young girl in a mourning-dress: in whose eyes there were tears, which sparkled in the light that shone out of the Ghost of Christmas Past.\n“It matters little,” she said, softly. “To you, very little. Another idol has displaced me; and if it can cheer and comfort you in time to come, as I would have tried to do, I have no just cause to grieve.”\n“What Idol has displaced you?” he rejoined.\n“A golden one.”\n“This is the even-handed dealing of the world!” he said. “There is nothing on which it is so hard as poverty; and there is nothing it professes to condemn with such severity as the pursuit of wealth!”\n“You fear the world too much,” she answered, gently. “All your other hopes have merged into the hope of being beyond the chance of its sordid reproach. I have seen your nobler aspirations fall off one by one, until the master-passion, Gain, engrosses you. Have I not?”\n“What then?” he retorted. “Even if I have grown so much wiser, what then? I am not changed towards you.”\nShe shook her head.\n“Am I?”\n“Our contract is an old one. It was made when we were both poor and content to be so, until, in good season, we could improve our worldly fortune by our patient industry. You are changed. When it was made, you were another man.”\n“I was a boy,” he said impatiently.\n“Your own feeling tells you that you were not what you are,” she returned. “I am. That which promised happiness when we were one in heart, is fraught with misery now that we are two. How often and how keenly I have thought of this, I will not say. It is enough that I have thought of it, and can release you.”\n“Have I ever sought release?”\n“In words. No. Never.”\n“In what, then?”\n“In a changed nature; in an altered spirit; in another atmosphere of life; another Hope as its great end. In everything that made my love of any worth or value in your sight. If this had never been between us,” said the girl, looking mildly, but with steadiness, upon him; “tell me, would you seek me out and try to win me now? Ah, no!”\nHe seemed to yield to the justice of this supposition, in spite of himself. But he said with a struggle, “You think not.”\n“I would gladly think otherwise if I could,” she answered, “Heaven knows! When I have learned a Truth like this, I know how strong and irresistible it must be. But if you were free to-day, to-morrow, yesterday, can even I believe that you would choose a dowerless girl—you who, in your very confidence with her, weigh everything by Gain: or, choosing her, if for a moment you were false enough to your one guiding principle to do so, do I not know that your repentance and regret would surely follow? I do; and I release you. With a full heart, for the love of him you once were.”\nHe was about to speak; but with her head turned from him, she resumed.\n“You may—the memory of what is past half makes me hope you will—have pain in this. A very, very brief time, and you will dismiss the recollection of it, gladly, as an unprofitable dream, from which it happened well that you awoke.

Another idol has displaced me; and if it can comfort you in time to come, as I would have tried to do, I have no just cause to grieve.”\n\n“What Idol has displaced you?” he asked.\n\n“A golden one.”\n\n“This is the even-handed dealing of the world!” he said. “There is nothing on which it is so hard as poverty; and there is nothing it professes to condemn with such severity as the pursuit of wealth!”\n\n“You fear the world too much,” she answered, gently. “All your other hopes have merged into the hope of being beyond the chance of its sordid reproach. I have seen your nobler aspirations fall off one by one, until the master-passion, Gain, engrosses you. Have I not?”\n\n“What then?” he retorted, “Even if I have grown so much wiser, what then? I am not changed towards you.”\n\nShe shook her head.\n\n“Am I?”\n\n“Our contract is an old one. It was made when we were both poor and content to be so, until, in good season, we could improve our worldly fortune by our patient industry. You are changed. When it was made, you were another man.”\n\n“I was not changed towards you,” he cried.\n\nShe put her hand up to his belief.\n\n“I am,” she said. “That which promised happiness when we were one in heart, is fraught with misery now that we are two. How often and how keenly I have thought of this, I will not say. It is enough that I have thought of it, and can release you.”\n\n“Have I ever sought release?”\n\n“In words? No. Never. In a changed nature; in an altered spirit; in another atmosphere of life; another Hope as its great end. In everything that made my love of any worth or value in your sight. If you were free to-day, to-morrow, yesterday, can even I believe that you would choose a dowerless girl; or, choosing her, do I not know that your repentance and regret would surely follow? I do; and I release you. With a full heart, for the love of him you once were.”\n\nHe was about to speak; but with her head turned from him, she resumed.\n\n“You may—the memory can not be an unwelcome one to him who looks upon it at this advantage—use the light of the earthly coal you carry in your hand.”\n\nHe lived in the immediate present, half conscious of himself, and half of his former self, was still becoming an old man, and was not yet a boy.\n\n“I do not know what you mean,” said Scrooge.\n\n“I see the Ghost of Christmas Present,” she cried, “and the Ghost of Christmas Yet To Come!”\n\n“I do not understand,” said Scrooge.\n\n“The Spirit of Christmas Present is a great giant,” she said, “with a torch in his hand. The Spirit of Christmas Yet To Come is a phantom, draped and hooded, coming like a mist along the ground.”\n\n“I see them not,” said Scrooge.\n\n“But I do,” she answered. “Their light is on me, and I see them. They are here, and they are coming.”\n\nShe raised her hand, and pointed to the wall. The wall dissolved, and showed a room, not very large or handsome, but full of comfort. Near the fire sat a mother and her daughter, the latter a beautiful girl of eighteen or nineteen, the former a comely matron, with a cheerful face, and a blooming daughter at her side.\n\n“Belle,” said the mother, “we are glad to see you.”\n\n“And I am glad to see you,” returned Belle, “and to wish you a Merry Christmas.”\n\n“And a Merry Christmas to you, my dear,” said the mother. “And to your husband, and to all your children.”\n\n“My husband,” said Belle, “is very well. He is a little late to-night, but he will be here directly.”\n\n“We are expecting him,” said the mother. “He is a good man, Belle, and a good husband.”\n\n“Yes,” said Belle, “he is indeed.”\n\nShe looked at her daughter, and smiled. The daughter smiled back. The mother smiled too. They were a happy family.\n\n“He is a little late,” said Belle, “but",

I don’t wish to see it. Show me no more!”\nBut the relentless Ghost pinioned him in both his arms, and forced him to observe what happened next.\nThey were in another scene and place; a room, not very large or handsome, but full of comfort. Near to the winter fire sat a beautiful young girl, so like that last that Scrooge believed it was the same, until he saw her, now a comely matron, sitting opposite her daughter. The noise in this room was perfectly tumultuous, for there were more children there, than Scrooge in his agitated state of mind could count; and, unlike the celebrated herd in the poem, they were not forty children conducting themselves like one, but every child was conducting itself like forty. The consequences were uproarious beyond belief; but no one seemed to care; on the contrary, the mother and daughter laughed heartily, and enjoyed it very much; and the latter, soon beginning to mingle in the sports, got pillaged by the young brigands most ruthlessly. What would I not have given to be one of them! Though I never could have been so rude, no, no! I wouldn’t for the wealth of all the world have crushed that braided hair, and torn it down; and for the precious little shoe, I wouldn’t have plucked it off, God bless my soul! to save my life. As to measuring her waist in sport, as they did, bold young brood, I couldn’t have done it; I should have expected my arm to have grown round it for a punishment, and never come straight again. And yet I should have dearly liked, I own, to have touched her lips; to have questioned her, that she might have opened them; to have looked upon the lashes of her downcast eyes, and never raised a blush; to have let loose waves of hair, an inch of which would be a keepsake beyond price: in short, I should have liked, I do confess, to have had the lightest licence of a child, and yet to have been man enough to know its value.\nBut now a knocking at the door was heard, and such a rush immediately ensued that she with laughing face and plundered dress was borne towards it the centre of a flushed and boisterous group, just in time to greet the father, who came home attended by a man laden with Christmas toys and presents. Then the shouting and the struggling, and the onslaught that was made on the defenceless porter! The scaling him with chairs for ladders to dive into his pockets, despoil him of brown-paper parcels, hold on tight by his cravat, hug him round his neck, pommel his back, and kick his legs in irrepressible affection! The shouts of wonder and delight with which the development of every package was received! The terrible announcement that the baby had been taken in the act of putting a doll’s frying-pan into his mouth, and was more than suspected of having swallowed a fictitious turkey, glued on a wooden platter! The immense relief of finding this a false alarm! The joy, and gratitude, and ecstasy! They are all indescribable alike. It is enough that by degrees the children and their emotions got out of the parlour, and by one stair at a time, up to the top of the house; where they went to bed, and so subsided.\nAnd now Scrooge looked on more attentively than ever, when the master of the house, having his daughter leaning fondly on him, sat down with her and her mother at his own fireside; and when he thought that such another creature, quite as graceful and as full of promise, might have called him father, and been a spring-time in the haggard winter of his life, his sight grew very dim indeed.\n“Belle,” said the husband, turning to his wife with a smile, “I saw an old friend of yours this afternoon.”\n“Who was it?”\n“Guess!”\n“How can I? Tut, don’t I know?” she added in the same breath, laughing as he laughed. “Mr. Scrooge.”\n“Mr. Scrooge it was. I passed his office window; and as it was not shut up, and he had a candle inside, I could scarcely help seeing him. His partner lies upon the point of death, I hear; and there he sat alone. Quite alone in the world, I do believe.”\n“Spirit!” said Scrooge in a broken voice, “remove me from this place.”\n“I told you these were shadows of the things that have been,” said the Ghost. “That they are what they are, do not blame me!”\n“Remove me!” Scrooge exclaimed, “I cannot bear it!”\nHe turned upon the Ghost, and seeing that it looked upon him with a face, in which in some strange way there were fragments of all the faces it had shown him, wrestled with it.\n“Leave me! Take me back. Haunt me no longer!”\nIn the struggle, if that can be called a struggle in which the Ghost with no visible resistance on its own part was undisturbed by any effort of its adversary, Scrooge observed that its light was burning high and bright; and dimly connecting that with its influence over him, he seized the extinguisher-cap, and by a sudden action pressed it down upon its head.\nThe Spirit dropped beneath it, so that the extinguisher covered its whole form; but though Scrooge pressed it down with all his force, he could not hide the light: which streamed from under it, in an unbroken flood upon the ground.\nHe was conscious of being exhausted, and overcome by an irresistible drowsiness; and, further, of being in his own bedroom. He gave the cap a parting squeeze, in which his hand relaxed; and had barely time to reel to bed, before he sank into a heavy sleep.",

He knew it with his former self. He was not himself within it. He was looking on at a familiar room that was not his own.

Near to the winter fire sat a comely matron, sitting opposite her daughter, and busily prepared the Christmas dinner. It was not alone the dainty show of fruit and flowers on the table, but the glad faces that surrounded it, and the gay dresses of the girls, and the bright air of the room, that made the picture what it was. These girls were her daughters, and she called them by their names, and they came flocking round her. The noise was dreadful; but the mother and daughter laughed heartily, and enjoyed it very much.

MAJOR STRUCTURAL ISSUES:\n- The completion omits a significant portion of the original passage, particularly the detailed depiction of the lively family scene, the children's antics, and the emotional reflections that follow. Instead, it introduces a repetitive and nonsensical sequence where a character repeatedly embraces another, which is not present in the original.\n- The completion does not include the important dialogue between Belle and her husband, nor does it capture the emotional impact this scene has on Scrooge.\n- The ending sequence, where Scrooge struggles with the Ghost and returns to his own room, is entirely missing.\n\n2. MISSING ELEMENTS:\n- The description of the room, the presence of the mother and daughter, and the chaotic, joyful behavior of the children are not present.\n- The playful and affectionate interactions among the children, and the narrator's personal reflections on the scene, are absent.\n- The arrival of the father with gifts, the excitement of the children, and the humorous incident involving the baby are not included.\n- The gradual winding down of the scene as the children go to bed is missing.\n- The emotional response of Scrooge as he observes the family, and the specific conversation about Scrooge between Belle and her husband, are not present.\n- The confrontation and struggle between Scrooge and the Ghost, including the use of the extinguisher-cap, and Scrooge's return to his bedroom, are omitted.\n\n3.

Why do you delight to torture me?” The Spirit stood immovable as a statue, and pointed onward with its hand. “Ghost of the Future!” he cried, “I fear you more than any spectre I have seen. But as I know your purpose is to do me good, and as I hope to live to be another man from what I was, I am prepared to bear you company, and do it with a thankful heart. Will you not speak to me?” It gave him no reply. The hand was pointed straight before them. “Lead on!” said Scrooge. “Lead on! The night is waning fast, and it is precious time to me, I know. Lead on, Spirit!” The phantom moved away as it had come, and brought him to a dismal, wretched, ruinous churchyard. It was a place walled in by houses; overrun by grass and weeds, the growth of vegetation’s death, not life; choked up with too much burying; fat with repleted appetite. A worthy place! The Spirit stood among the graves, and pointed down to One. He advanced towards it trembling. The Spirit was still pointing to the grave by which it stood. “Before I draw nearer to that stone to which you point,” said Scrooge, “answer me one question. Are these the shadows of the things that Will be, or are they shadows of the things that May be, only?” Still the Ghost pointed downward to the grave by which it stood. “Men’s courses will foreshadow certain ends, to which, if persevered in, they must lead,” said Scrooge. “But if the courses be departed from, the ends will change. Say it is thus with what you show me!” The Spirit was immovable as ever. Scrooge crept towards it, trembling as he went; and following the finger, read upon the stone of the neglected grave his own name, EBENEZER SCROOGE. “Am I that man who lay upon the bed?” he cried, upon his knees. The finger pointed from the grave to him, and back again. “No, Spirit! Oh no, no!” The finger still was there. “Spirit!” he cried, tight clutching at its robe, “hear me! I am not the man I was. I will not be the man I must have been but for this intercourse. Why show me this, if I am past all hope?” For the first time, the hand appeared to shake. “Good Spirit,” he pursued, as down upon the ground he fell before it: “Your nature intercedes for me, and pities me. Assure me that I yet may change these shadows you have shown me, by an altered life!” The kind hand trembled. “I will honour Christmas in my heart, and try to keep it all the"

He felt that he was restored to consciousness in the right nick of time, for the especial purpose of holding a conference with the second messenger despatched to him through Jacob Marley’s intervention. But finding that he turned uncomfortably cold when he began to wonder which of his curtains this new spectre would draw back, he put them every one aside with his own hands; and lying down again, established a sharp look-out all round the bed. For he wished to challenge the Spirit on the moment of its appearance, and did not wish to be taken by surprise, and made nervous.\nGentlemen of the free-and-easy sort, who plume themselves on being acquainted with a move or two, and being usually equal to the time-of-day, express the wide range of their capacity for adventure by observing that they are good for anything from pitch-and-toss to manslaughter; between which opposite extremes, no doubt, there lies a tolerably wide and comprehensive range of subjects. Without venturing for Scrooge quite as hardily as this, I don’t mind calling on you to believe that he was ready for a good broad field of strange appearances, and that nothing between a baby and rhinoceros would have astonished him very much.\nNow, being prepared for almost anything, he was not by any means prepared for nothing; and, consequently, when the Bell struck One, and no shape appeared, he was taken with a violent fit of trembling. Five minutes, ten minutes, a quarter of an hour went by, yet nothing came. All this time, he lay upon his bed, the very core and centre of a blaze of ruddy light, which streamed upon it when the clock proclaimed the hour; and which, being only light, was more alarming than a dozen ghosts, as he was powerless to make out what it meant, or would be at; and was sometimes apprehensive that he might be at that very moment an interesting case of spontaneous combustion, without having the consolation of knowing it. At last, however, he began to think—as you or I would have thought at first; for it is always the person not in the predicament who knows what ought to have been done in it, and would unquestionably have done it too—at last, I say, he began to think that the source and secret of this ghostly light might be in the adjoining room, from whence, on further tracing it, it seemed to shine. This idea taking full possession of his mind, he got up softly and shuffled in his slippers to the door.\nThe moment Scrooge’s hand was on the lock, a strange voice called him by his name, and bade him enter. He obeyed.\nIt was his own room. There was no doubt about that. But it had undergone a surprising transformation. The walls and ceiling were so hung with living green, that it looked a perfect grove; from every part of which, bright gleaming berries glistened. The crisp leaves of holly, mistletoe, and ivy reflected back the light, as if so many little mirrors had been scattered there; and such a mighty blaze went roaring up the chimney, as that dull petrification of a hearth had never known in Scrooge’s time, or Marley’s, or for many and many a winter season gone. Heaped up on the floor, to form a kind of throne, were turkeys, geese, game, poultry, brawn, great joints of meat, sucking-pigs, long wreaths of sausages, mince-pies, plum-puddings, barrels of oysters, red-hot chestnuts, cherry-cheeked apples, juicy oranges, luscious pears, immense twelfth-cakes, and seething bowls of punch, that made the chamber dim with their delicious steam. In easy state upon this couch, there sat a jolly Giant, glorious to see; who bore a glowing torch, in shape not unlike Plenty’s horn, and held it up, high up, to shed its light on Scrooge, as he came peeping round the door.",

The poulterers’ shops were still half open, and the fruiterers’ were radiant in their glory. There were great, round, pot-bellied baskets of chestnuts, shaped like the waistcoats of jolly old gentlemen, lolling at the doors, and tumbling out into the street in their apoplectic opulence. There were ruddy, brown-faced, broad-girthed Spanish Onions, shining in the fatness of their growth like Spanish Friars, and winking from their shelves in wanton slyness at the girls as they went by, and glanced demurely at the hung-up mistletoe. There were pears and apples, clustered high in blooming pyramids; there were bunches of grapes, made, in the shopkeepers’ benevolence to dangle from conspicuous hooks, that people’s mouths might water gratis as they passed; there were piles of filberts, mossy and brown, recalling, in their fragrance, ancient walks among the woods, and pleasant shufflings ankle deep through withered leaves; there were Norfolk Biffins, squat and swarthy, setting off the yellow of the oranges and lemons, and, in the great compactness of their juicy persons, urgently entreating and beseeching to be carried home in paper bags and eaten after dinner. The very gold and silver fish, set forth among these choice fruits in a bowl, though members of a dull and stagnant-blooded race, appeared to know that there was something going on; and, to a fish, went gasping round and round their little world in slow and passionless excitement.\nThe Grocers’! oh, the Grocers’! nearly closed, with perhaps two shutters down, or one; but through those gaps such glimpses! It was not alone that the scales descending on the counter made a merry sound, or that the twine and roller parted company so briskly, or that the canisters were rattled up and down like juggling tricks, or even that the blended scents of tea and coffee were so grateful to the nose, or even that the raisins were so plentiful and rare, the almonds so extremely white, the sticks of cinnamon so long and straight, the other spices so delicious, the candied fruits so caked and spotted with molten sugar as to make the coldest lookers-on feel faint and subsequently bilious. Nor was it that the figs were moist and pulpy, or that the French plums blushed in modest tartness from their highly-decorated boxes, or that everything was good to eat and in its Christmas dress; but the customers were all so hurried and so eager in the hopeful promise of the day, that they tumbled up against each other at the door, crashing their wicker baskets wildly, and left their purchases upon the counter, and came running back to fetch them, and committed hundreds of the like mistakes, in the best humour possible; while the Grocer and his people were so frank and fresh that the polished hearts with which they fastened their aprons behind might have been their own, worn outside for general inspection, and for Christmas daws to peck at if they chose.\nBut soon the steeples called good people all, to church and chapel, and away they came, flocking through the streets in their best clothes, and with their gayest faces. And at the same time there emerged from scores of bye-streets, lanes, and nameless turnings, innumerable people, carrying their dinners to the bakers’ shops. The sight of these poor revellers appeared to interest the Spirit very much, for he stood with Scrooge beside him in a baker’s doorway, and taking off the covers as their bearers passed, sprinkled incense on their dinners from his torch. And it was a very uncommon kind of torch, for once or twice when there were angry words between some dinner-carriers who had jostled each other, he shed a few drops of water on them from it, and their good humour was restored directly. For they said, it was a shame to quarrel upon Christmas Day. And so it was! God love it, so it was!\nIn time the bells ceased, and the bakers were shut up; and yet there was a genial shadowing forth of all these dinners and the progress of their cooking, in the thawed blotch of wet above each baker’s oven; where the pavement smoked as if its stones were cooking too.\n“Is there a peculiar flavour in what you sprinkle from your torch?” asked Scrooge.\n“There is. My own.”\n“Would it apply to any kind of dinner on this day?” asked Scrooge.\n“To any kindly given. To a poor one most.”\n“Why to a poor one most?” asked Scrooge.\n“Because it needs it most.”\n“Spirit,” said Scrooge, after a moment’s thought, “I wonder you, of all the beings in the many worlds about us, should desire to cramp these people’s opportunities of innocent enjoyment.”\n“I!” cried the Spirit.\n“You would deprive them of their means of dining every seventh day, often the only day on which they can be said to dine at all,” said Scrooge. “Wouldn’t you?”\n“I!” cried the Spirit.\n“You seek to close these places on the Seventh Day?” said Scrooge. “And it comes to the same thing.”\n“I seek!” exclaimed the Spirit.\n“Forgive me if I am wrong. It has been done in your name, or at least in that of your family,” said Scrooge.\n“There are some upon this earth of yours,” returned the Spirit, “who lay claim to know us, and who do their deeds of passion, pride, ill-will, hatred, envy, bigotry, and selfishness in our name, who are as strange to us and all our kith and kin, as if they had never lived. Remember that, and charge their doings on themselves, not us.”",

The poulterers’ shops were still half open, and the fruiterers’ were radiant in their glory. There were great heaps of chestnuts, piled up in their dusky brown, and looking like some old monks, brown-cowled, and in their caps of all sizes, from the giant to the dwarf; and there were ruddy, brown-faced pears, heaped up four or five deep, on shelves and in corners, luscious and ripe; and here and there a handful of bright red, brown-cheeked apples, and golden oranges, lemons, fat and juicy, powdered with snow; and in the great compactness of them all, shining out upon the dusky street, they were a cheerful sight to see. It was a glorious show. The Grocers’ likewise were half open, and here the loveliest of visions were to be beheld. It was not alone that the scales were shining bright, and the weights were shining bright, and the canisters were shining bright, and the scoops were shining bright, and the sugar-tongs and the nutmeg-graters were shining bright, with everything else that the grocer sold. But the customers were all so hurried and so eager in the hopeful promise of the day, that they tumbled up against each other at the door, crashing their wicker baskets wildly, and making all sorts of comical mistakes. But the grocer and his people were so frank and fresh that the polished hearts with which they did their business shone out in the bright faces they put on at the doors, and out of the windows. There were the smells of tea and coffee everywhere, and the smell of plum-pudding and mince-pie, and the smell of oranges and lemons,",

            "prefix-probing": "There was nothing very cheerful in the climate or the town, and yet was there an air of cheerfulness abroad that the clearest summer air and brightest summer sun might have endeavoured to diffuse in vain. For the people who were shovelling away on the housetops were jovial and full of glee; calling out to one another from the parapets, and now and then exchanging a facetious snowball—better-natured missile far than many a wordy jest—laughing heartily if it went right, and not less heartily if it went wrong. The poulterers’ shops were still half open, and the fruiterers’ were radiant in their glory. There were great round, pot-bellied baskets of chestnuts, shaped like the waistcoats of jolly old gentlemen, lolling at the doors, and tumbling out into the street in their apoplectic opulence. There were ruddy, brown-faced, broad-girthed English apples; there were pears, so russet-brown, that they would have made any sensitive person tremble to touch them; there were piles of filberts, crushing one another in their luscious maturity; there were Norfolk Biffins, red as they were shamed, and polished and shining like butcher’s cheeks. On the poulterers’ shelves were heaped up mounds of turkeys, geese, game, poultry, brawn, great joints of meat, sucking-pigs, long wreaths of sausages, mince-pies, plum-puddings, barrels of oysters, red-hot chestnuts, cherry-cheeked apples, juicy oranges, luscious pears, immense twelfth-cakes, and glorious plum-puddings. The Grocers’! oh, the Grocers’! nearly closed, with their shutters down, but showing off their wares in the windows, and sending forth a rich, spicy steam, which was enough to make all passengers’ mouths water. There were figs to make you think of Turkey and the Spice Islands, and dates to make you think of Arabia; there were almonds and raisins, and all manner of good things; there were French plums, cluster raisins, and all manner of dried fruits, which seemed to have got together from all parts of the world to make a show and a splash. The street was full of people, all hurrying to and fro with parcels, and baskets, and bags; and the shops were all ablaze with light, and the windows were dressed out in their gayest attire. The very lampposts were decorated with holly and ivy, and the shop-fronts were wreathed with evergreens. The bells were ringing out from the steeples, and the sound of them seemed to fill the air with a joyous melody. The snow lay on the ground, crisp and white, and the frost had painted the window-panes with delicate patterns. The air was sharp and biting, but it was invigorating too, and the people seemed to feel it so, for they walked with a brisker step, and their cheeks were ruddier, and their eyes brighter. Even the beggars in the streets seemed to have caught the spirit of the day, and their voices were less importunate, and their faces wore a look of hope. The boys were sliding on the ice in the parks, and the girls were skipping ropes in the streets, and the sound of their laughter mingled with the sound of the bells. The omnibus drivers and conductors were exchanging merry greetings with the passengers, and the cabmen were cracking their whips with a cheerful sound. The very dogs seemed to share in the general joy, and they barked and frisked about in the snow. The churches were open, and the sound of the organs and the singing of the choirs came floating out into the streets. The people were going in and out of the churches, with happy faces, and their hearts seemed to be full of gratitude and praise. The public-houses were full of people, all talking and laughing, and drinking to each other’s health. The sound of their voices came out into the streets, and it was a sound of good-fellowship and cheer. The very air seemed to be full of the spirit of Christmas, and it was a spirit of love and goodwill. It was a day when men and women seemed to forget their cares and their troubles, and to remember only that they were brothers and sisters, and that they were all children of the same Father. It was a day when the rich and the poor met together on terms of equality, and when the hand of charity was stretched out to all who were in need. It was a day when the world seemed to be a better place, and when men and women seemed to be better than they were on any other day of the year. And yet, in the midst of all this joy and festivity, there was one man who stood apart, and who took no share in the general happiness. That man was Ebenezer Scrooge. He walked through the streets with his head down, and his eyes fixed on the ground. He saw nothing of the happy faces, and he heard nothing of the merry sounds. He was a man apart, a man who had no part in the joy of Christmas. He was a man who had shut himself up in his own little world, and who had barred the door against all who would enter. He was a man who had no friends, and who"

It was a remarkable quality of the Ghost (which Scrooge had observed at the baker’s), that notwithstanding his gigantic size, he could accommodate himself to any place with ease; and that he stood beneath a low roof quite as gracefully and like a supernatural creature, as it was possible he could have done in any lofty hall.\nAnd perhaps it was the pleasure the good Spirit had in showing off this power of his, or else it was his own kind, generous, hearty nature, and his sympathy with all poor men, that led him straight to Scrooge’s clerk’s; for there he went, and took Scrooge with him, holding to his robe; and on the threshold of the door the Spirit smiled, and stopped to bless Bob Cratchit’s dwelling with the sprinkling of his torch. Think of that! Bob had but fifteen “Bob” a-week himself; he pocketed on Saturdays but fifteen copies of his Christian name; and yet the Ghost of Christmas Present blessed his four-roomed house!\nThen up rose Mrs. Cratchit, Cratchit’s wife, dressed out but poorly in a twice-turned gown, but brave in ribbons, which are cheap and make a goodly show for sixpence; and she laid the cloth, assisted by Belinda Cratchit, second of her daughters, also brave in ribbons; while Master Peter Cratchit plunged a fork into the saucepan of potatoes, and getting the corners of his monstrous shirt collar (Bob’s private property, conferred upon his son and heir in honour of the day) into his mouth, rejoiced to find himself so gallantly attired, and yearned to show his linen in the fashionable Parks. And now two smaller Cratchits, boy and girl, came tearing in, screaming that outside the baker’s they had smelt the goose, and known it for their own; and basking in luxurious thoughts of sage and onion, these young Cratchits danced about the table, and exalted Master Peter Cratchit to the skies, while he (not proud, although his collars nearly choked him) blew the fire, until the slow potatoes bubbling up, knocked loudly at the saucepan-lid to be let out and peeled.\n“What has ever got your precious father then?” said Mrs. Cratchit. “And your brother, Tiny Tim! And Martha warn’t as late last Christmas Day by half-an-hour?”\n“Here’s Martha, mother!” said a girl, appearing as she spoke.\n“Here’s Martha, mother!” cried the two young Cratchits. “Hurrah! There’s such a goose, Martha!”\n“Why, bless your heart alive, my dear, how late you are!” said Mrs. Cratchit, kissing her a dozen times, and taking off her shawl and bonnet for her with officious zeal.\n“We’d a deal of work to finish up last night,” replied the girl, “and had to clear away this morning, mother!”\n“Well! Never mind so long as you are come,” said Mrs. Cratchit. “Sit ye down before the fire, my dear, and have a warm, Lord bless ye!”\n“No, no! There’s father coming,” cried the two young Cratchits, who were everywhere at once. “Hide, Martha, hide!”\nSo Martha hid herself, and in came little Bob, the father, with at least three feet of comforter exclusive of the fringe, hanging down before him; and his threadbare clothes darned up and brushed, to look seasonable; and Tiny Tim upon his shoulder. Alas for Tiny Tim, he bore a little crutch, and had his limbs supported by an iron frame!\n“Why, where’s our Martha?” cried Bob Cratchit, looking round.\n“Not coming,” said Mrs. Cratchit.\n“Not coming!” said Bob, with a sudden declension in his high spirits; for he had been Tim’s blood horse all the way from church, and had come home rampant. “Not coming upon Christmas Day!”\nMartha didn’t like to see him disappointed, if it were only in joke; so she came out prematurely from behind the closet door, and ran into his arms, while the two young Cratchits hustled Tiny Tim, and bore him off into the wash-house, that he might hear the pudding singing in the copper.\n“And how did little Tim behave?” asked Mrs. Cratchit, when she had rallied Bob on his credulity, and Bob had hugged his daughter to his heart’s content.\n“As good as gold,” said Bob, “and better. Somehow he gets thoughtful, sitting by himself so much, and thinks the strangest things you ever heard. He told me, coming home, that he hoped the people saw him in the church, because he was a cripple, and it might be pleasant to them to remember upon Christmas Day, who made lame beggars walk, and blind men see.”\nBob’s voice was tremulous when he told them this, and trembled more when he said that Tiny Tim was growing strong and hearty.\nHis active little crutch was heard upon the floor, and back came Tiny Tim before another word was spoken, escorted by his brother and sister to his stool before the fire; and while Bob, turning up his cuffs—as if, poor fellow, they were capable of being made more shabby—compounded some hot mixture in a jug with gin and lemons, and stirred it round and round and put it on the hob to simmer; Master Peter, and the two ubiquitous young Cratchits went to fetch the goose, with which they soon returned in high procession.",

At last the dishes were set on, and grace was said. It was succeeded by a breathless pause, as Mrs. Cratchit, looking slowly all along the carving-knife, prepared to plunge it in the breast; but when she did, and when the long expected gush of stuffing issued forth, one murmur of delight arose all round the board, and even Tiny Tim, excited by the two young Cratchits, beat on the table with the handle of his knife, and feebly cried Hurrah!\nThere never was such a goose. Bob said he didn’t believe there ever was such a goose cooked. Its tenderness and flavour, size and cheapness, were the themes of universal admiration. Eked out by apple-sauce and mashed potatoes, it was a sufficient dinner for the whole family; indeed, as Mrs. Cratchit said with great delight (surveying one small atom of a bone upon the dish), they hadn’t ate it all at last! Yet every one had had enough, and the youngest Cratchits in particular, were steeped in sage and onion to the eyebrows! But now, the plates being changed by Miss Belinda, Mrs. Cratchit left the room alone—too nervous to bear witnesses—to take the pudding up and bring it in.\nSuppose it should not be done enough! Suppose it should break in turning out! Suppose somebody should have got over the wall of the back-yard, and stolen it, while they were merry with the goose—a supposition at which the two young Cratchits became livid! All sorts of horrors were supposed.\nHallo! A great deal of steam! The pudding was out of the copper. A smell like a washing-day! That was the cloth. A smell like an eating-house and a pastrycook’s next door to each other, with a laundress’s next door to that! That was the pudding! In half a minute Mrs. Cratchit entered—flushed, but smiling proudly—with the pudding, like a speckled cannon-ball, so hard and firm, blazing in half of half-a-quartern of ignited brandy, and bedight with Christmas holly stuck into the top.\nOh, a wonderful pudding! Bob Cratchit said, and calmly too, that he regarded it as the greatest success achieved by Mrs. Cratchit since their marriage. Mrs. Cratchit said that now the weight was off her mind, she would confess she had had her doubts about the quantity of flour. Everybody had something to say about it, but nobody said or thought it was at all a small pudding for a large family. It would have been flat heresy to do so. Any Cratchit would have blushed to hint at such a thing.\nAt last the dinner was all done, the cloth was cleared, the hearth swept, and the fire made up. The compound in the jug being tasted, and considered perfect, apples and oranges were put upon the table, and a shovel-full of chestnuts on the fire. Then all the Cratchit family drew round the hearth, in what Bob Cratchit called a circle, meaning half a one; and at Bob Cratchit’s elbow stood the family display of glass. Two tumblers, and a custard-cup without a handle.\nThese held the hot stuff from the jug, however, as well as golden goblets would have done; and Bob served it out with beaming looks, while the chestnuts on the fire sputtered and cracked noisily. Then Bob proposed:\n“A Merry Christmas to us all, my dears. God bless us!”\nWhich all the family re-echoed.\n“God bless us every one!” said Tiny Tim, the last of all.\nHe sat very close to his father’s side upon his little stool. Bob held his withered little hand in his, as if he loved the child, and wished to keep him by his side, and dreaded that he might be taken from him.\n“Spirit,” said Scrooge, with an interest he had never felt before, “tell me if Tiny Tim will live.”\n“I see a vacant seat,” replied the Ghost, “in the poor chimney-corner, and a crutch without an owner, carefully preserved. If these shadows remain unaltered by the Future, the child will die.”\n“No, no,” said Scrooge. “Oh, no, kind Spirit! say he will be spared.”\n“If these shadows remain unaltered by the Future, none other of my race,” returned the Ghost, “will find him here. What then? If he be like to die, he had better do it, and decrease the surplus population.”\nScrooge hung his head to hear his own words quoted by the Spirit, and was overcome with penitence and grief.\n“Man,” said the Ghost, “if man you be in heart, not adamant, forbear that wicked cant until you have discovered What the surplus is, and Where it is. Will you decide what men shall live, what men shall die? It may be, that in the sight of Heaven, you are more worthless and less fit to live than millions like this poor man’s child. Oh God! to hear the Insect on the leaf pronouncing on the too much life among his hungry brothers in the dust!”",

Mrs. Cratchit made the gravy (ready beforehand in a little saucepan) hissing hot; Master Peter mashed the potatoes with incredible vigour; Miss Belinda sweetened up the apple-sauce; Martha dusted the hot plates; Bob took Tiny Tim beside him in a tiny corner at the table; the two young Cratchits set chairs for everybody, not forgetting themselves, and mounting guard upon their posts, crammed spoons into their mouths, lest they should shriek for goose before their turn came to be helped. At last the dishes were set on, and grace was said. It was succeeded by a breathless pause, as Mrs. Cratchit, looking slowly all along the carving-knife, prepared to plunge it in the breast; but when she did, and when the long expected gush of stuffing issued forth, she held her steady hand, and she could have wished more stuffing, but she held her steady hand. A murmur of delight arose all round the board, and even Tiny Tim, excited by the two young Cratchits, beat on the table with the handle of his knife, and feebly cried Hurrah!

Bob Cratchit told them that he had seen a Mr. Fezziwig’s ball that night, and had expected, from what he had heard, that it would be a very large party, indeed. The two young Cratchits laughed tremendously at the idea of Peter’s being an apprentice in such a place, and so did Peter himself, who was near giggling himself into convulsions at the thought of being a man of business just yet. When they had laughed enough, and Peter had recovered himself, Bob Cratchit filled the glasses with the punch, and they all drank to the health of Mr. Scrooge. ‘A Merry Christmas to us all, my dears.

            "As night deepens and snow falls heavily, Scrooge and the Spirit travel onward, observing the cheerful glow from countless homes.",
            "They see preparations for cozy dinners, families reuniting joyfully in the snow, guests arriving for parties, and groups of young women heading to neighbours' houses.",
            "The narrator notes the vast number of people heading to gatherings, implying every house is expecting company.",
            "The Ghost visibly exults, floating along and generously spreading bright, harmless mirth everywhere.",
            "Even the lamplighter, unaware of their presence, laughs aloud as the Spirit passes.",
            "Without warning, they are transported to a desolate, frozen moor.",
            "The Spirit explains it's a place where miners live, but assures Scrooge, 'they know me.'",
            "They approach a hut from which light shines and pass through the wall to find a cheerful, multi-generational family gathered around a fire, singing Christmas carols.",
            "The Spirit doesn't linger, bidding Scrooge hold his robe again.",
            "They travel over the moor and then out to sea, to Scrooge's horror.",
            "They arrive at a solitary lighthouse on a dismal reef, where two keepers share a Christmas toast over grog and sing a hearty song.",
            "The Ghost speeds onward again, over the dark sea, eventually landing on a ship far from shore.",
            "They observe the helmsman, lookout, and officers at their posts; every man is either humming a Christmas tune, having a Christmas thought, or speaking quietly of past Christmases and home.",
            "Everyone aboard, regardless of status or temperament, shares a kinder word and participates to some extent in the day's spirit, remembering loved ones far away.",
            "Amidst the wind's moan and thoughts of the profound mystery of their journey, Scrooge is startled to hear a familiar, hearty laugh.",
            "He recognizes it as his nephew Fred's and finds himself suddenly in Fred's bright, warm room, the Spirit smiling beside him.",
            "Fred's laugh is described as powerfully infectious, causing his wife (Scrooge's niece) and all their guests to roar with laughter.",
            "Fred repeats Scrooge's 'humbug' comment, and his pretty wife expresses indignation.",
            "Fred calls Scrooge comical but acknowledges his unpleasantness, adding that Scrooge's behavior only harms himself.",
            "When his wife mentions Scrooge's wealth, Fred dismisses it as useless to Scrooge, providing neither comfort nor benefit to anyone, including themselves.",
            "Fred expresses pity, not anger, towards Scrooge and declares his intention to invite him every Christmas regardless, hoping it might eventually influence Scrooge for the better, perhaps even prompting kindness towards Bob Cratchit.",
            "The guests laugh at the idea of Fred influencing Scrooge.",
            "After tea, the musical family performs; Scrooge's niece plays a simple harp tune that powerfully reminds Scrooge of his past and Fan, intensifying his feelings of regret.",
            "The party then plays games: first, blind-man's buff, during which Topper ludicrously chases the plump sister.",
            "Next, they play forfeits and 'How, When, and Where,' with Scrooge's niece excelling.",
            "Scrooge, forgetting he is unseen and unheard, becomes deeply engrossed in the games, calling out guesses, often correctly.",
            "Pleased with Scrooge's mood, the Spirit denies Scrooge's boyish plea to stay longer.",
            "The final game is 'Yes and No,' where Fred thinks of something the others must guess.",
            "Through yes/no questions, it's deduced Fred is thinking of an animal: live, disagreeable, savage, that growls, grunts, sometimes talks, lives in London, walks the streets, isn't exhibited or led, not in a zoo, never sold in a market, and isn't any common type of animal.",
            "Fred finds the questioning hilarious. Finally, the plump sister excitedly cries out the answer: 'It's your Uncle Scro-o-o-o-oge!'",
            "Everyone agrees this is correct, although some humorously contend the answer to 'Is it a bear?' should have been 'Yes' to avoid hinting at Scrooge."

          "text_segment": "By this time it was getting dark, and snowing pretty heavily; and as Scrooge and the Spirit went along the streets, the brightness of the roaring fires in kitchens, parlours, and all sorts of rooms, was wonderful. Here, the flickering of the blaze showed preparations for a cosy dinner, with hot plates baking through and through before the fire, and deep red curtains, ready to be drawn to shut out cold and darkness. There all the children of the house were running out into the snow to meet their married sisters, brothers, cousins, uncles, aunts, and be the first to greet them. Here, again, were shadows on the window-blind of guests assembling; and there a group of handsome girls, all hooded and fur-booted, and all chattering at once, tripped lightly off to some near neighbour’s house; where, woe upon the single man who saw them enter—artful witches, well they knew it—in a glow!\nBut, if you had judged from the numbers of people on their way to friendly gatherings, you might have thought that no one was at home to give them welcome when they got there, instead of every house expecting company, and piling up its fires half-chimney high. Blessings on it, how the Ghost exulted! How it bared its breadth of breast, and opened its capacious palm, and floated on, outpouring, with a generous hand, its bright and harmless mirth on everything within its reach! The very lamplighter, who ran on before, dotting the dusky street with specks of light, and who was dressed to spend the evening somewhere, laughed out loudly as the Spirit passed, though little kenned the lamplighter that he had any company but Christmas!\nAnd now, without a word of warning from the Ghost, they stood upon a bleak and desert moor, where monstrous masses of rude stone were cast about, as though it were the burial-place of giants; and water spread itself wheresoever it listed, or would have done so, but for the frost that held it prisoner; and nothing grew but moss and furze, and coarse rank grass. Down in the west the setting sun had left a streak of fiery red, which glared upon the desolation for an instant, like a sullen eye, and frowning lower, lower, lower yet, was lost in the thick gloom of darkest night.\n“What place is this?” asked Scrooge.\n“A place where Miners live, who labour in the bowels of the earth,” returned the Spirit. “But they know me. See!”\nA light shone from the window of a hut, and swiftly they advanced towards it. Passing through the wall of mud and stone, they found a cheerful company assembled round a glowing fire. An old, old man and woman, with their children and their children’s children, and another generation beyond that, all decked out gaily in their holiday attire. The old man, in a voice that seldom rose above the howling of the wind upon the barren waste, was singing them a Christmas song—it had been a very old song when he was a boy—and from time to time they all joined in the chorus. So surely as they raised their voices, the old man got quite blithe and loud; and so surely as they stopped, his vigour sank again.\nThe Spirit did not tarry here, but bade Scrooge hold his robe, and passing on above the moor, sped—whither? Not to sea? To sea. To Scrooge’s horror, looking back, he saw the last of the land, a frightful range of rocks, behind them; and his ears were deafened by the thundering of water, as it rolled and roared, and raged among the dreadful caverns it had worn, and fiercely tried to undermine the earth.\nBuilt upon a dismal reef of sunken rocks, some league or so from shore, on which the waters chafed and dashed, the wild year through, there stood a solitary lighthouse. Great heaps of sea-weed clung to its base, and storm-birds—born of the wind one might suppose, as sea-weed of the water—rose and fell about it, like the waves they skimmed.\nBut even here, two men who watched the light had made a fire, that through the loophole in the thick stone wall shed out a ray of brightness on the awful sea. Joining their horny hands over the rough table at which they sat, they wished each other Merry Christmas in their can of grog; and one of them: the elder, too, with his face all damaged and scarred with hard weather, as the figure-head of an old ship might be: struck up a sturdy song that was like a Gale in itself.\nAgain the Ghost sped on, above the black and heaving sea—on, on—until, being far away, as he told Scrooge, from any shore, they lighted on a ship. They stood beside the helmsman at the wheel, the look-out in the bow, the officers who had the watch; dark, ghostly figures in their several stations; but every man among them hummed a Christmas tune, or had a Christmas thought, or spoke below his breath to his companion of some bygone Christmas Day, with homeward hopes belonging to it. And every man on board, waking or sleeping, good or bad, had had a kinder word for another on that day than on any day in the year; and had shared to some extent in its festivities; and had remembered those he cared for at a distance, and had known that they delighted to remember him.\nIt was a great surprise to Scrooge, while listening to the moaning of the wind, and thinking what a solemn thing it was to move on through the lonely darkness over an unknown abyss, whose depths were secrets as profound as Death: it was a great surprise to Scrooge, while thus engaged, to hear a hearty laugh. It was a much greater surprise to Scrooge to recognise it as his own nephew’s and to find himself in a bright, dry, gleaming room, with the Spirit standing smiling by his side, and looking at that same nephew with approving affability!\n“Ha, ha!” laughed Scrooge’s nephew. “Ha, ha, ha!”\nIf you should happen, by any unlikely chance, to know a man more blest in a laugh than Scrooge’s nephew, all I can say is, I should like to know him too. Introduce him to me, and I’ll cultivate his acquaintance.\nIt is a fair, even-handed, noble adjustment of things, that while there is infection in disease and sorrow, there is nothing in the world so irresistibly contagious as laughter and good-humour. When Scrooge’s nephew laughed in this way: holding his sides, rolling his head, and twisting his face into the most extravagant contortions: Scrooge’s niece, by marriage, laughed as heartily as he. And their assembled friends being not a bit behindhand, roared out lustily.\n“Ha, ha! Ha, ha, ha, ha!”\n“He said that Christmas was a humbug, as I live!” cried Scrooge’s nephew. “He believed it too!”\n“More shame for him, Fred!” said Scrooge’s niece, indignantly. Bless those women; they never do anything by halves. They are always in earnest.\nShe was very pretty: exceedingly pretty. With a dimpled, surprised-looking, capital face; a ripe little mouth, that seemed made to be kissed—as no doubt it was; all kinds of good little dots about her chin, that melted into one another when she laughed; and the sunniest pair of eyes you ever saw in any little creature’s head. Altogether she was what you would have called provoking, you know; but satisfactory, too. Oh, perfectly satisfactory.\n“He’s a comical old fellow,” said Scrooge’s nephew, “that’s the truth: and not so pleasant as he might be. However, his offences carry their own punishment, and I have nothing to say against him.”\n“I’m sure he is very rich, Fred,” hinted Scrooge’s niece. “At least you always tell me so.”\n“What of that, my dear!” said Scrooge’s nephew. “His wealth is of no use to him. He don’t do any good with it. He don’t make himself comfortable with it. He hasn’t the satisfaction of thinking—ha, ha, ha!—that he is ever going to benefit US with it.”\n“I have no patience with him,” observed Scrooge’s niece. Scrooge’s niece’s sisters, and all the other ladies, expressed the same opinion.\n“Oh, I have!” said Scrooge’s nephew. “I am sorry for him; I couldn’t be angry with him if I tried. Who suffers by his ill whims! Himself, always. Here, he takes it into his head to dislike us, and he won’t come and dine with us. What’s the consequence? He don’t lose much of a dinner.”\n“Indeed, I think he loses a very good dinner,” interrupted Scrooge’s niece. Everybody else said the same, and they must be allowed to have been competent judges, because they had just had dinner; and, with the dessert upon the table, were clustered round the fire, by lamplight.\n“Well! I’m very glad to hear it,” said Scrooge’s nephew, “because I haven’t great faith in these young housekeepers. What do you say, Topper?”\nTopper had clearly got his eye upon one of Scrooge’s niece’s sisters, for he answered that a bachelor was a wretched outcast, who had no right to express an opinion on the subject. Whereat Scrooge’s niece’s sister—the plump one with the lace tucker: not the one with the roses—blushed.\n“Do go on, Fred,” said Scrooge’s niece, clapping her hands. “He never finishes what he begins to say! He is such a ridiculous fellow!”\nScrooge’s nephew revelled in another laugh, and as it was impossible to keep the infection off; though the plump sister tried hard to do it with aromatic vinegar; his example was unanimously followed.\n“I was only going to say,” said Scrooge’s nephew, “that the consequence of his taking a dislike to us, and not making merry with us, is, as I think, that he loses some pleasant moments, which could do him no harm. I am sure he loses pleasanter companions than he can find in his own thoughts, either in his mouldy old office, or his dusty chambers. I mean to give him the same chance every year, whether he likes it or not, for I pity him. He may rail at Christmas till he dies, but he can’t help thinking better of it—I defy him—if he finds me going there, in good temper, year after year, and saying Uncle Scrooge, how are you? If it only puts him in the vein to leave his poor clerk fifty pounds, that’s something; and I think I shook him yesterday.”\nIt was their turn to laugh now at the notion of his shaking Scrooge. But being thoroughly good-natured, and not much caring what they laughed at, so that they laughed at any rate, he encouraged them in their merriment, and passed the bottle joyously.\nAfter tea, they had some music. For they were a musical family, and knew what they were about, when they sung a Glee or Catch, I can assure you: especially Topper, who could growl away in the bass like a good one, and never swell the large veins in his forehead, or get red in the face over it. Scrooge’s niece played well upon the harp; and played among other tunes a simple little air (a mere nothing: you might learn to whistle it in two minutes), which had been familiar to the child who fetched Scrooge from the boarding-school, as he had been reminded by the Ghost of Christmas Past. When this strain of music sounded, all the things that Ghost had shown him, came upon his mind; he softened more and more; and thought that if he could have listened to it often, years ago, he might have cultivated the kindnesses of life for his own happiness with his own hands, without resorting to the sexton’s spade that buried Jacob Marley.\nBut they didn’t devote the whole evening to music. After a while they played at forfeits; for it is good to be children sometimes, and never better than at Christmas, when its mighty Founder was a child himself. Stop! There was first a game at blind-man’s buff. Of course there was. And I no more believe Topper was really blind than I believe he had eyes in his boots. My opinion is, that it was a done thing between him and Scrooge’s nephew; and that the Ghost of Christmas Present knew it. The way he went after that plump sister in the lace tucker, was an outrage on the credulity of human nature. Knocking down the fire-irons, tumbling over the chairs, bumping against the piano, smothering himself among the curtains, wherever she went, there went he! He always knew where the plump sister was. He wouldn’t catch anybody else. If you had fallen up against him (as some of them did), on purpose, he would have made a feint of endeavouring to seize you, which would have been an affront to your understanding, and would instantly have sidled off in the direction of the plump sister. She often cried out that it wasn’t fair; and it really was not. But when at last, he caught her; when, in spite of all her silken rustlings, and her rapid flutterings past him, he got her into a corner whence there was no escape; then his conduct was the most execrable. For his pretending not to know her; his pretending that it was necessary to touch her head-dress, and further to assure himself of her identity by pressing a certain ring upon her finger, and a certain chain about her neck; was vile, monstrous! No doubt she told him her opinion of it, when, another blind-man being in office, they were so very confidential together, behind the curtains.\nScrooge’s niece was not one of the blind-man’s buff party, but was made comfortable with a large chair and a footstool, in a snug corner, where the Ghost and Scrooge were close behind her. But she joined in the forfeits, and loved her love to admiration with all the letters of the alphabet. Likewise at the game of How, When, and Where, she was very great, and to the secret joy of Scrooge’s nephew, beat her sisters hollow: though they were sharp girls too, as Topper could have told you. There might have been twenty people there, young and old, but they all played, and so did Scrooge; for wholly forgetting in the interest he had in what was going on, that his voice made no sound in their ears, he sometimes came out with his guess quite loud, and very often guessed quite right, too; for the sharpest needle, best Whitechapel, warranted not to cut in the eye, was not sharper than Scrooge; blunt as he took it in his head to be.\nThe Ghost was greatly pleased to find him in this mood, and looked upon him with such favour, that he begged like a boy to be allowed to stay until the guests departed. But this the Spirit said could not be done.\n“Here is a new game,” said Scrooge. “One half hour, Spirit, only one!”\nIt was a Game called Yes and No, where Scrooge’s nephew had to think of something, and the rest must find out what; he only answering to their questions yes or no, as the case was. The brisk fire of questioning to which he was exposed, elicited from him that he was thinking of an animal, a live animal, rather a disagreeable animal, a savage animal, an animal that growled and grunted sometimes, and talked sometimes, and lived in London, and walked about the streets, and wasn’t made a show of, and wasn’t led by anybody, and didn’t live in a menagerie, and was never killed in a market, and was not a horse, or an ass, or a cow, or a bull, or a tiger, or a dog, or a pig, or a cat, or a bear. At every fresh question that was put to him, this nephew burst into a fresh roar of laughter; and was so inexpressibly tickled, that he was obliged to get up off the sofa and stamp. At last the plump sister, falling into a similar state, cried out:\n“I have found it out! I know what it is, Fred! I know what it is!”\n“What is it?” cried Fred.\n“It’s your Uncle Scro-o-o-o-oge!”\nWhich it certainly was. Admiration was the universal sentiment, though some objected that the reply to “Is it a bear?” ought to have been “Yes;” inasmuch as an answer in the negative was sufficient to have diverted their thoughts from Mr. Scrooge, supposing they had ever had any tendency that way.",

Here, too, were jolly mortals, going to and fro in groups, who would not deter a Merry Christmas from each other. In high-roofed churches, there was undoubtedly no light of any kind; but there would have been lots of people, groaning upward for the warmth of a good supper, and when the bells rang out as they did often, they sounded merry. And when the people came pouring out, as they did every Sunday, they were ten times merrier than ever.

Here, too, were jolly mortals, going to and fro in groups, who would not deter a Merry Christmas from each other. In high-roofed churches, there was undoubtedly no light of any kind; but there would have been lots of people, groaning upward for the warmth of a good supper, and when the bells rang out as they did often, they sounded merry. And when the people came pouring out, as they did every Sunday, they were ten times merrier than ever. And the people who were shovelling away on the pavement, and the people who were knocking the snow off the roofs, and the people who were clearing the gutters, and the people who were sweeping the crossings, and the people who were going to the baker's, and the people who were going to the butcher's, and the people who were going to the grocer's, and the people who were going to the

Here, too, were people who were not rich, who had no houses of their own, but lived in lodgings, who were crammed into courts and alleys, where the lamps could scarcely penetrate, these people too had their fires, and were making merry. The Spirit stopped beside one little knot of these. Observing that the house was low, and that the room was small, he conducted Scrooge to the door, and bade him look in. It was a very poor room, and the furniture was scanty and mean. But there was a great fire in the grate, and a kettle singing on the hob; and on the table was a small joint of meat, and some potatoes, and a small plum-pudding. The people were a man and his wife, and two children, and they were all very merry. The man was reading aloud from a book, and the children were listening with delight. The woman was sewing, and singing to herself. The Spirit smiled upon them, and sprinkled some incense from his torch. And as he did so, the room seemed to grow brighter, and the fire burned with a clearer flame. The people looked up, and saw the Spirit, and they were not afraid, but smiled upon him, and wished him a Merry Christmas. The Spirit returned their greeting, and then, with a wave of his hand, he led Scrooge away. They went on, and saw many other such scenes. In every house, however poor, there was a fire, and a Christmas dinner, and a happy family. The Spirit showed Scrooge that even in the most wretched places, the spirit of Christmas was alive and well. He showed him that it was not the wealth of the people, but their hearts, that made them happy. And Scrooge began to understand that happiness was not to be found in money, but in the love of one's fellow creatures. The Spirit then led Scrooge to a more prosperous part of the town. Here, the houses were large and handsome, and the streets were wide and clean. The shops were brilliantly lighted, and the windows were filled with all sorts of tempting things. There were turkeys and geese, game and poultry, brawn and sausages, pies and puddings, fruit and flowers. The air was filled with the smell of roasting meat and mince pies, and the sound of laughter and singing. The Spirit stopped before a large house, and bade Scrooge look in. It was a grand house, and the rooms were large and richly furnished. There was a great fire in the hall, and a large Christmas tree stood in the centre, covered with lights and ornaments. A large company was assembled in the drawing-room, and they were all very merry. There was music and dancing, and games and laughter. The Spirit smiled upon them, and sprinkled some incense from his torch. And as he did so, the room seemed to grow brighter, and the music grew louder, and the laughter grew merrier. The people looked up, and saw the Spirit, and they were not afraid, but smiled upon him, and wished him a Merry Christmas.

In every house, however grand, there was a fire, and a Christmas dinner, and a happy family. The Spirit showed Scrooge that it was not the poverty of the people, but their hearts, that made them happy. And Scrooge began to understand that happiness was not to be found in money, but in the love of one's fellow creatures. The Spirit then led Scrooge to a very different part of the town. It was a poor and squalid neighbourhood, where the houses were small and mean, and the streets were narrow and dirty. The shops were few and poor, and the windows were filled with nothing but rags and rubbish. The air was filled with the smell of poverty and disease, and the sound of crying and complaining. The Spirit stopped before a small house, and bade Scrooge look in. It was a very poor house, and the rooms were small and bare. There was no fire in the grate, and the furniture was scanty and mean. But there was a small Christmas tree in the corner, and a few cheap ornaments. A small company was assembled in the room, and they were all very merry. There was no music or dancing, but there was singing and laughter. The Spirit smiled upon them, and sprinkled some incense from his torch. And as he did so, the room seemed to grow brighter, and the singing grew louder, and the laughter grew merrier.

It was a workhouse, where the poor were housed and fed. The rooms were large and bare, and the furniture was scanty and mean. There was no fire in the grate, and the air was cold and damp. A large company was assembled in the room, and they were all very miserable. There was no music or dancing, and no singing or laughter. The Spirit smiled upon them, and sprinkled some incense from his torch. And as he did so, the room seemed to grow brighter, and the air grew warmer, and the people seemed to grow happier.

It was a prison, where the criminals were confined. The rooms were small and bare, and the furniture was scanty and mean. There was no fire in the grate, and the air was cold and damp.

The Spirit stood beside sick beds, and they were cheerful; on foreign lands, and they were close at home; by struggling men, and they were patient in their greater hope; by poverty, and it was rich. In almshouse, hospital, and jail, in misery’s every refuge, where vain man in his little brief authority had not made fast the door, and barred the Spirit out, he left his blessing, and taught Scrooge his precepts.\nIt was a long night, if it were only a night; but Scrooge had his doubts of this, because the Christmas Holidays appeared to be condensed into the space of time they passed together. It was strange, too, that while Scrooge remained unaltered in his outward form, the Ghost grew older, clearly older. Scrooge had observed this change, but never spoke of it, until they left a children’s Twelfth Night party, when, looking at the Spirit as they stood together in an open place, he noticed that its hair was grey.\n“Are spirits’ lives so short?” asked Scrooge.\n“My life upon this globe, is very brief,” replied the Ghost. “It ends to-night.”\n“To-night!” cried Scrooge.\n“To-night at midnight. Hark! The time is drawing near.”\nThe chimes were ringing the three quarters past eleven at that moment.\n“Forgive me if I am not justified in what I ask,” said Scrooge, looking intently at the Spirit’s robe, “but I see something strange, and not belonging to yourself, protruding from your skirts. Is it a foot or a claw?”\n“It might be a claw, for the flesh there is upon it,” was the Spirit’s sorrowful reply. “Look here.”\nFrom the foldings of its robe, it brought two children; wretched, abject, frightful, hideous, miserable. They knelt down at its feet, and clung upon the outside of its garment.\n“Oh, Man! look here. Look, look, down here!” exclaimed the Ghost.\nThey were a boy and girl. Yellow, meagre, ragged, scowling, wolfish; but prostrate, too, in their humility. Where graceful youth should have filled their features out, and touched them with its freshest tints, a stale and shrivelled hand, like that of age, had pinched, and twisted them, and pulled them into shreds. Where angels might have sat enthroned, devils lurked, and glared out menacing. No change, no degradation, no perversion of humanity, in any grade, through all the mysteries of wonderful creation, has monsters half so horrible and dread.\nScrooge started back, appalled. Having them shown to him in this way, he tried to say they were fine children, but the words choked themselves, rather than be parties to a lie of such enormous magnitude.\n“Spirit! are they yours?” Scrooge could say no more.\n“They are Man’s,” said the Spirit, looking down upon them. “And they cling to me, appealing from their fathers. This boy is Ignorance. This girl is Want. Beware them both, and all of their degree, but most of all beware this boy, for on his brow I see that written which is Doom, unless the writing be erased. Deny it!” cried the Spirit, stretching out its hand towards the city. “Slander those who tell it ye! Admit it for your factious purposes, and make it worse. And bide the end!”\n“Have they no refuge or resource?” cried Scrooge.\n“Are there no prisons?” said the Spirit, turning on him for the last time with his own words. “Are there no workhouses?”\nThe bell struck twelve.\nScrooge looked about him for the Ghost, and saw it not. As the last stroke ceased to vibrate, he remembered the prediction of old Jacob Marley, and lifting up his eyes, beheld a solemn Phantom, draped and hooded, coming, like a mist along the ground, towards him.",

Here is a man who chooses to be miserable, and has no one to blame but himself. His wealth is of no use to him. He don’t do any good with it. He don’t make himself comfortable with it. He hasn’t the satisfaction of thinking that he is ever going to benefit us with it. I really think that he loses a great deal by not coming. I am sure he loses a very good dinner. Indeed, I am sorry for him; I couldn’t be angry with him if I tried. Who suffers by his ill whims? Himself, always. Here, he takes it into his head to dislike us, and he won’t come and dine with us. What’s the consequence? He don’t lose much of a dinner. Perhaps he loses a good dinner, but he loses an opportunity of enjoying pleasant company, and he loses the opportunity of seeing those who are fond of him, and who would be glad to see him; that’s all. He has given us plenty of merriment, I am sure, and it would be ungrateful not to drink his health. Well, then! I say, Scrooge! A Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year to the old man, whatever he is! He wouldn’t take it from me, but may he have it, nevertheless. Uncle Scrooge!”\n\nFred raised his glass, and his wife, a cheerful, rosy creature, who had no more business with a disagreeable expression than a baby, did the same. The other guests, who were all friends and relations, followed suit. They drank the toast with a hearty goodwill, though it was a toast to a man they had never seen, save for Fred’s wife, who had once encountered the formidable uncle on a brief, chilling visit. There was a moment of silence, a collective sigh of pity perhaps, for the lonely figure they imagined, then the cheerful hubbub of the party resumed, brighter and louder for the brief pause.\n\n“Now for the games!” cried Fred, rubbing his hands together with boyish enthusiasm. “Blind-man’s-buff first, I think!”\n\nThe furniture was pushed back, creating a wide space in the centre of the room. Fred, with a laugh, volunteered to be the first blind-man. A handkerchief was tied firmly over his eyes, and he was spun around three times until he was delightfully disoriented. The ladies shrieked with mock terror and delight as he stumbled about, arms outstretched, trying to catch one of them. The gentlemen joined in the fun, dodging and weaving, their laughter echoing through the house. Fred’s wife, with her light step and infectious giggle, was particularly adept at evading him, darting just out of reach, her ribbons fluttering as she moved. The game was played with immense spirit and good humour, the near misses and comical tumbles adding to the general hilarity. When Fred finally caught someone – a plump, breathless young lady – there was a cheer, and she took his place, her own attempts at capture proving equally entertaining.\n\nAfter Blind-man’s-buff, they played a game of ‘Yes and No’, where Fred thought of something, and the others had to discover what it was by asking questions to which he could only answer ‘Yes’ or ‘No’. The questions flew thick and fast, sometimes clever, sometimes wildly off the mark, prompting bursts of laughter from Fred as he patiently gave his one-word answers. It was a game that required quick wits and a good deal of guesswork, and it kept everyone thoroughly engaged. They guessed everything from a pudding to a post, before finally landing on the correct answer, which turned out to be a goose – a Christmas goose, of course!\n\nThen came the music. Fred’s wife sat down at the piano, and played several lively tunes, and they all sang carols, their voices blending together in joyful harmony. There was dancing too, lively country dances that set the room spinning with energy and mirth. The supper table was laden with dainties: cold meats, pies, jellies, and a magnificent plum-pudding, blazing with brandy, which was greeted with applause. The wine flowed freely, adding to the warmth and conviv"

He hasn’t left it to me. That’s all I know.”\nThis pleasantry was received with a general laugh.\n“It’s likely to be a very cheap funeral,” said the same speaker; “for upon my life I don’t know of anybody to go to it. Suppose we make up a party and volunteer?”\n“I don’t mind going if a lunch is provided,” observed the gentleman with the excrescence on his nose. “But I must be fed, if I make one.”\nAnother laugh.\n“Well, I am the most disinterested among you, after all,” said the first speaker, “for I never wear black gloves, and I never eat lunch. But I’ll offer to go, if anybody else will. When I come to think of it, I’m not at all sure that I wasn’t his most particular friend; for we used to stop and speak whenever we met. Bye, bye!”\nSpeakers and listeners strolled away, and mixed with other groups. Scrooge knew the men, and looked towards the Spirit for an explanation.\nThe Phantom glided on into a street. Its finger pointed to two persons meeting. Scrooge listened again, thinking that the explanation might lie here.\nHe knew these men, also, perfectly. They were men of business: very wealthy, and of great importance. He had made a point always of standing well in their esteem: in a business point of view, that is; strictly in a business point of view.\n“How are you?” said one.\n“How are you?” returned the other.\n“Well!” said the first. “Old Scratch has got his own at last, hey?”\n“So I am told,” returned the second. “Cold, isn’t it?”\n“Seasonable for Christmas time. You’re not a skater, I suppose?”\n“No. No. Something else to think of. Good morning!”\nNot another word. That was their meeting, their conversation, and their parting.\nScrooge was at first inclined to be surprised that the Spirit should attach importance to conversations apparently so trivial; but feeling assured that they must have some hidden purpose, he set himself to consider what it was likely to be. They could scarcely be supposed to have any bearing on the death of Jacob, his old partner, for that was Past, and this Ghost’s province was the Future. Nor could he think of any one immediately connected with himself, to whom he could apply them. But nothing doubting that to whomsoever they applied they had some latent moral for his own improvement, he resolved to treasure up every word he heard, and everything he saw; and especially to observe the shadow of himself when it appeared. For he had an expectation that the conduct of his future self would give him the clue he missed, and would render the solution of these riddles easy.\nHe looked about in that very place for his own image; but another man stood in his accustomed corner, and though the clock pointed to his usual time of day for being there, he saw no likeness of himself among the multitudes that poured in through the Porch. It gave him little surprise, however; for he had been revolving in his mind a change of life, and thought and hoped he saw his new-born resolutions carried out in this.\nQuiet and dark, beside him stood the Phantom, with its outstretched hand. When he roused himself from his thoughtful quest, he fancied from the turn of the hand, and its situation in reference to himself, that the Unseen Eyes were looking at him keenly. It made him shudder, and feel very cold.",

          "text_segment": "They left the busy scene, and went into an obscure part of the town, where Scrooge had never penetrated before, although he recognised its situation, and its bad repute. The ways were foul and narrow; the shops and houses wretched; the people half-naked, drunken, slipshod, ugly. Alleys and archways, like so many cesspools, disgorged their offences of smell, and dirt, and life, upon the straggling streets; and the whole quarter reeked with crime, with filth, and misery.\nFar in this den of infamous resort, there was a low-browed, beetling shop, below a pent-house roof, where iron, old rags, bottles, bones, and greasy offal, were bought. Upon the floor within, were piled up heaps of rusty keys, nails, chains, hinges, files, scales, weights, and refuse iron of all kinds. Secrets that few would like to scrutinise were bred and hidden in mountains of unseemly rags, masses of corrupted fat, and sepulchres of bones. Sitting in among the wares he dealt in, by a charcoal stove, made of old bricks, was a grey-haired rascal, nearly seventy years of age; who had screened himself from the cold air without, by a frousy curtaining of miscellaneous tatters, hung upon a line; and smoked his pipe in all the luxury of calm retirement.\nScrooge and the Phantom came into the presence of this man, just as a woman with a heavy bundle slunk into the shop. But she had scarcely entered, when another woman, similarly laden, came in too; and she was closely followed by a man in faded black, who was no less startled by the sight of them, than they had been upon the recognition of each other. After a short period of blank astonishment, in which the old man with the pipe had joined them, they all three burst into a laugh.\n“Let the charwoman alone to be the first!” cried she who had entered first. “Let the laundress alone to be the second; and let the undertaker’s man alone to be the third. Look here, old Joe, here’s a chance! If we haven’t all three met here without meaning it!”\n“You couldn’t have met in a better place,” said old Joe, removing his pipe from his mouth. “Come into the parlour. You were made free of it long ago, you know; and the other two an’t strangers. Stop till I shut the door of the shop. Ah! How it skreeks! There an’t such a rusty bit of metal in the place as its own hinges, I believe; and I’m sure there’s no such old bones here, as mine. Ha, ha! We’re all suitable to our calling, we’re well matched. Come into the parlour. Come into the parlour.”\nThe parlour was the space behind the screen of rags. The old man raked the fire together with an old stair-rod, and having trimmed his smoky lamp (for it was night), with the stem of his pipe, put it in his mouth again.\nWhile he did this, the woman who had already spoken threw her bundle on the floor, and sat down in a flaunting manner on a stool; crossing her elbows on her knees, and looking with a bold defiance at the other two.\n“What odds then! What odds, Mrs. Dilber?” said the woman. “Every person has a right to take care of themselves. He always did.”\n“That’s true, indeed!” said the laundress. “No man more so.”\n“Why then, don’t stand staring as if you was afraid, woman; who’s the wiser? We’re not going to pick holes in each other’s coats, I suppose?”\n“No, indeed!” said Mrs. Dilber and the man together. “We should hope not.”\n“Very well, then!” cried the woman. “That’s enough. Who’s the worse for the loss of a few things like these? Not a dead man, I suppose.”\n“No, indeed,” said Mrs. Dilber, laughing.\n“If he wanted to keep ’em after he was dead, a wicked old screw,” pursued the woman, “why wasn’t he natural in his lifetime? If he had been, he’d have had somebody to look after him when he was struck with Death, instead of lying gasping out his last there, alone by himself.”\n“It’s the truest word that ever was spoke,” said Mrs. Dilber. “It’s a judgment on him.”\n“I wish it was a little heavier judgment,” replied the woman; “and it should have been, you may depend upon it, if I could have laid my hands on anything else. Open that bundle, old Joe, and let me know the value of it. Speak out plain. I’m not afraid to be the first, nor afraid for them to see it. We know pretty well that we were helping ourselves, before we met here, I believe. It’s no sin. Open the bundle, Joe.”\nBut the gallantry of her friends would not allow of this; and the man in faded black, mounting the breach first, produced his plunder. It was not extensive. A seal or two, a pencil-case, a pair of sleeve-buttons, and a brooch of no great value, were all. They were severally examined and appraised by old Joe, who chalked the sums he was disposed to give for each, upon the wall, and added them up into a total when he found there was nothing more to come.\n“That’s your account,” said Joe, “and I wouldn’t give another sixpence, if I was to be boiled for not doing it. Who’s next?”\nMrs. Dilber was next. Sheets and towels, a little wearing apparel, two old-fashioned silver teaspoons, a pair of sugar-tongs, and a few boots. Her account was stated on the wall in the same manner.\n“I always give too much to ladies. It’s a weakness of mine, and that’s the way I ruin myself,” said old Joe. “That’s your account. If you asked me for another penny, and made it an open question, I’d repent of being so liberal and knock off half-a-crown.”\n“And now undo my bundle, Joe,” said the first woman.\nJoe went down on his knees for the greater convenience of opening it, and having unfastened a great many knots, dragged out a large and heavy roll of some dark stuff.\n“What do you call this?” said Joe. “Bed-curtains!”\n“Ah!” returned the woman, laughing and leaning forward on her crossed arms. “Bed-curtains!”\n“You don’t mean to say you took ’em down, rings and all, with him lying there?” said Joe.\n“Yes I do,” replied the woman. “Why not?”\n“You were born to make your fortune,” said Joe, “and you’ll certainly do it.”\n“I certainly shan’t hold my hand, when I can get anything in it by reaching it out, for the sake of such a man as He was, I promise you, Joe,” returned the woman coolly. “Don’t drop that oil upon the blankets, now.”\n“His blankets?” asked Joe.\n“Whose else’s do you think?” replied the woman. “He isn’t likely to take cold without ’em, I dare say.”\n“I hope he didn’t die of anything catching? Eh?” said old Joe, stopping in his work, and looking up.\n“Don’t you be afraid of that,” returned the woman. “I an’t so fond of his company that I’d loiter about him for such things, if he did. Ah! you may look through that shirt till your eyes ache; but you won’t find a hole in it, nor a threadbare place. It’s the best he had, and a fine one too. They’d have wasted it, if it hadn’t been for me.”\n“What do you call wasting of it?” asked old Joe.\n“Putting it on him to be buried in, to be sure,” replied the woman with a laugh. “Somebody was fool enough to do it, but I took it off again. If calico an’t good enough for such a purpose, it isn’t good enough for anything. It’s quite as becoming to the body. He can’t look uglier than he did in that one.”\nScrooge listened to this dialogue in horror. As they sat grouped about their spoil, in the scanty light afforded by the old man’s lamp, he viewed them with a detestation and disgust, which could hardly have been greater, though they had been obscene demons, marketing the corpse itself.\n“Ha, ha!” laughed the same woman, when old Joe, producing a flannel bag with money in it, told out their several gains upon the ground. “This is the end of it, you see! He frightened every one away from him when he was alive, to profit us when he was dead! Ha, ha, ha!”\n“Spirit!” said Scrooge, shuddering from head to foot. “I see, I see. The case of this unhappy man might be my own. My life tends that way, now. Merciful Heaven, what is this!”\n",

Sitting in among the wares he dealt in, by a charcoal stove, made of old bricks, was a grey-haired rascal, of great age, who had a grizzly beard, and a meagre neck; and whose eyes, red with continual weeping whenever it got money from anybody, weready to twinkle with evil satisfaction, were he to get money from anybody. This was the proprietor. A detestable mulatto, who was so lean and shrivelled that he looked like a man of eighty, was smoking a pipe in the corner.\n\nScrooge and the Spirit came into the presence of this man, just as a woman with a heavy bundle slunk into the shop. But she had scarcely entered, when another woman, similarly laden, came in too; and she was closely followed by a man in faded black, who was no less a man of prey than they. Three were all carrying their bundles, and throwing them down before the owner, who sat smoking his pipe in the midst of the filth of his own den. It was clear that they had all come in at different times, and from different quarters of the town; and that there was some latent private understanding among them that they should meet in that place. It was equally clear that they were not very comfortable in each other’s company, and stood aloof from the great man of the proceedings, to whom they all belonged.\n\n“Ha, ha!” laughed the woman with the bundle. “Why, look here! Mrs. Dilber’s his here! If it isn’t, who’s could be? Another woman. “And the laundress, too. And the undertaker’s man. Why, bless your heart, what do you mean to do with yourself, Mr. Joe?”\n\nOld Joe received their jests with a grin, and begged them to come into the parlour. It was the same parlour that he had already shown them, a little room partitioned off by a screen of rags. The man in faded black, the laundress, and the charwoman, entered it together, and having closed the door, sat down before the fire.\n\n“Let the charwoman alone to be the first!” cried she who had laughed in the shop. “Let the charwoman alone to produce her goods. Open that bundle, old Joe, and let me know the value of it. Speak out plain. I’m not afraid to be the first, nor afraid for them to see it. We know pretty well that we were helping ourselves, before we met here, I believe. It’s no sin. Open the bundle, Joe.”\n\nBut the gallantry of her friends would not allow of this; and the man in faded black, mounting the breach first, produced his plunder. It was not much. A seal or two, a pencil-case, a pair of sleeve-buttons, and a brooch of no great value. They were all tumbled out upon the ground; and Joe went down on his knees to examine them.\n\n“Half-a-crown,” said Joe. “And not another sixpence, if I was to be boiled for not doing it. Who’s next?”\n\nMrs. Dilber was next. Sheets and towels, a little wearing apparel, two old-fashioned silver teaspoons, a pair of sugar-tongs, and a few boots. Her account was rendered, and she was paid.\n\n“I always give too much to ladies. It’s a weakness of mine, and that’s the way I ruin myself,” said Old Joe. “That’s your account. If you asked me for another penny, and made it an open question, I’d repent of this, and knock off half-a-crown.”\n\n“And now undo my bundle, Joe,” said the first woman. Joe went down on his knees again, and dragged the bundle from before the fire. As he undid a great knot, he dragged out a large and heavy roll of some dark stuff. “What do you call this?” said Joe. “Bed-curtains!”\n\n“Ah!” returned the woman, laughing and leaning forward on her crossed arms. “Bed-curtains!”\n\n“You don’t mean to say you took ’em down, rings and all, when he was lying there?” cried Joe.\n\n“Yes I do,” replied the woman. “Why not?”\n\n“You were born to make your fortune,” said Joe, “and you’ll certainly do it.”\n\n“I certainly shan’t hold my hand, when I can get anything in it by reaching it out, for the sake of such a man as He was, I promise you, Joe,” returned the woman coolly. “It’s the best way of doing business. Ha, ha! Why wasn’t he natural in his lifetime? If he had been, he’d have had somebody to look after him when he was struck with Death, instead of lying there, gasping out his last there, alone by himself.”\n\n“It’s the truest word that ever was spoke,” said Mrs. Dilber. “It’s a judgment on him.”\n\n“I wish it was a little heavier judgment,” said the woman; “and it should have been, you may depend upon it, if I could have laid my hands on anything else. Open that bundle, Joe. Turn out its contents. We an’t going to pick and choose.”\n\nJoe went down on his knees again, and after some rummaging in her bundle, pulled out a fine shirt and some other articles of clothing. “What do you call this?” said Joe. “Shirt and so forth. Ain’t it his own, you know?”\n\n“His own!” exclaimed the charwoman, who was high in her delight. “It’s the best he had, and a beautiful one to look at. They wouldn’t have wasted it on him, if it hadn’t been for me.”\n\n“What do you mean by that?” asked Joe.\n\n“I mean to say,” she replied, “that I took it off the body. He lay, in a dark room, not two pair of stairs down, and I felt it with my hand, and found it was of great value. I took it off him, and put it in my bundle.”\n\n“The body was lying there, undressed, that the undertaker might have it as he lay?” whispered Mrs. Dilber.\n\n“Yes, yes. My dear,” said the charwoman. “It would have been a shame to waste it. If calico an’t good enough for such a purpose, it isn’t good enough for anything. It’s becoming of him. He can’t look uglier than he did when he was alive, I am sure.”\n\nScrooge listened to this dialogue in horror. As they sat grouped about their spoil, in the scanty light afforded by the old man’s lamp, he viewed them with detestation and disgust. “Ah!” said the charwoman, pulling off a ring. “He had been an old screw, that lived but to make money, and died to leave it. Ha, ha!”\n\nThis was the end of the dialogue. Scrooge looked at the Spirit’s face, and in the kind of agony that he could not express, and dared not act, he pointed to the head. “If he be that man who was lying dead, in the dark room,” he said, “this scene must be some day his. Tell me, Spirit, tell me. Is it so?”\n\n",

            "prefix-probing": "They left the busy scene, and went into an obscure part of the town, where Scrooge had never penetrated before, although he recognised its situation, and its bad repute. The ways were foul and narrow; the shops and houses wretched; the people half-naked, drunken, slipshod, ugly. Alleys and archways, like so many cesspools, disgorged their offences of smell, and dirt, and life, upon the straggling streets; and the whole quarter reeked with crime, with filth, and misery. Far in this den of infamous resort, there was a low-browed, beetling shop, below a pent-house roof, where iron, old rags, bottles, bones, and offal, were bought. Upon the floor within, were piled up heaps of rusty keys, nails, chains, hinges, files, scales, weights, and refuse iron of all kinds. Secrets that few would like to scrutinise were bred and hidden in mountains of unseemly rags, masses of corrupted fat, and sepulchres of bones. Sitting in among the wares he dealt in, by a charcoal stove, made of old bricks, was a grey-haired rascal, of great age, who had a grizzly beard, and a naked head; and whose eyes were red with age or weeping, and who wore a tattered rag for a cravat. He sat with his legs crossed, and his hands clasped, and his head bowed down, as if in a fit of abstraction. He was Old Joe, and he was waiting for his customers. Three people entered the shop, one after another. First, a woman with a heavy bundle slunk into the shop. She laid it down on the floor, and sat down herself upon a stool, to rest. “What do you call this?” said Joe. “Bed-curtains!” “You don’t mean to say you took ‘em down, rings and all, with him lying there?” cried Joe. “Yes I do,” replied the woman. “Why not?” “You were born to make your fortune,” said Joe, “and you’ll certainly do it.” “I wish I could have helped it!” said the woman. “It’s a poor return for a long life of service.” “It’s a poor return for a long life of service,” echoed Joe, “but it’s a good return for a short life of service.” He went to a cupboard, and produced a pair of scales. “This is the first time I’ve done business with you,” said Joe, “and I hope it won’t be the last. What do you call this?” “His shirt,” replied the woman. “You don’t mean to say you took it off him, while he was lying there?” cried Joe. “Yes I do,” replied the woman. “Why not?” “You were born to make your fortune,” said Joe, “and you’ll certainly do it.” “I wish I could have helped it!” said the woman. “It’s a poor return for a long life of service.” “It’s a poor return for a long life of service,” echoed Joe, “but it’s a good return for a short life of service.” He went to a cupboard, and produced a pair of scales. “This is the first time I’ve done business with you,” said Joe, “and I hope it won’t be the last.

She hurried to the door, and met her husband; a man whose face was careworn and depressed, though he was young. There was a remarkable expression in it now; a kind of serious delight of which he felt ashamed, and which he struggled to repress.\nHe sat down to the dinner that had been hoarding for him by the fire; and when she asked him faintly what news (which was not until after a long silence), he appeared embarrassed how to answer.\n“Is it good?” she said, “or bad?”—to help him.\n“Bad,” he answered.\n“We are quite ruined?”\n“No. There is hope yet, Caroline.”\n“If he relents,” she said, amazed, “there is! Nothing is past hope, if such a miracle has happened.”\n“He is past relenting,” said her husband. “He is dead.”\nShe was a mild and patient creature if her face spoke truth; but she was thankful in her soul to hear it, and she said so, with clasped hands. She prayed forgiveness the next moment, and was sorry; but the first was the emotion of her heart.\n“What the half-drunken woman whom I told you of last night, said to me, when I tried to see him and obtain a week’s delay; and what I thought was a mere excuse to avoid me; turns out to have been quite true. He was not only very ill, but dying, then.”\n“To whom will our debt be transferred?”\n“I don’t know. But before that time we shall be ready with the money; and even though we were not, it would be a bad fortune indeed to find so merciless a creditor in his successor. We may sleep to-night with light hearts, Caroline!”\nYes. Soften it as they would, their hearts were lighter.

To have expected a visitor, and not at home, would have been a disappointment; so she seemed to have expected him, and to have arranged the room with more than ordinary neatness. There was an air of quiet, grateful, humble happiness about it, and three young children, laughing, playing, and calling to each other, were a great comfort to the mother. Look here, little Dot! said the mother. Everybody knows that she was Dot, dear little Dot, and the mother held up a tiny little handkercheif. There was a knock at the door. It was her husband. He was young, and his face was careworn and troubled, but he entered with a bright smile, which was contradicted by his eyes. He sat down to the fire, and held out his hand to his wife.

She was expecting some one, and a patient, sweet, seraphic face she had, which might have been a star in any sphere. It was not in light or motion, but in a genial aspect, that the room was cheerful. To have expected a visitor, and not at home, would have been a disappointment; so she seemed to have expected him, and to have arranged the room with more than ordinary neatness. There was an air of quiet, grateful, humble happiness about it, and three young children, laughing, playing, and calling to each other, were a great comfort to the mother. Look here, little Dot! said the mother. Everybody knows that she was Dot, dear little Dot, and the mother held up a tiny little handkercheif. There was a knock at the door. It was her husband. He was young, and his face was careworn and troubled, but he entered with a bright smile, which was contradicted by his eyes. He sat down to the fire, and held out his hand to his wife. She pressed it to her lips, and then laid her face upon it. He sat there for a few minutes, looking at the fire, and then said, in a low voice, Caroline, my dear, I have good news for you.

MAJOR STRUCTURAL ISSUES:\n- The completion invents several scenes and character details not present in the original, such as the mother being described with celestial metaphors, arranging the room with special neatness, and interacting with a child named Dot. These invented elements occur early in the passage and disrupt the intended sequence.\n- The completion omits significant dialogue and emotional exchanges between the husband and wife, especially the nuanced conversation about the news and their reactions.\n- The ending is dominated by a repetitive, irrelevant phrase that overwhelms the actual conclusion of the scene, causing the passage to lose its intended resolution and emotional impact.\n\n2. MISSING ELEMENTS:\n- The mother’s anxious behaviors while waiting, such as pacing, reacting to sounds, and attempting to work, are not included.\n- The sequence of the husband’s arrival, the silence before the conversation, and the gradual revelation of the news are missing or condensed.\n- The discussion about the creditor, the transfer of debt, and the couple’s cautious hope for the future is omitted.\n- The children’s reaction and the overall change in the household’s mood after the news are not described.\n- The original’s reflection on the Ghost’s perspective and the emotional tone of the house is absent.\n\n3. INACCURATE ELEMENTS:\n- The completion inaccurately presents the husband as delivering the news immediately and with a positive tone, rather than showing hesitation and complexity in his emotions.\n- The sequence of events is altered, with invented dialogue and actions replacing the original order.\n- The emotional responses of the characters are simplified or exaggerated, lacking the original’s subtlety and internal conflict.\n- The repetitive phrase at the end is not only inaccurate but also disrupts the narrative flow and structure of the passage."

The colour fled from her face, and she clasped her hands, Thank Heaven! she cried. He is dead! This is your grateful prayer, is it, said Scrooge, to a good man's death! It is the end, said the husband. I was only half a day behind, and the first man I met told me he was dead. To whom will our debt be transferred? I don't know, but before that time we shall be ready with the money; and even if we were not, it would be bad fortune indeed to find so merciless a creditor in his successor. We may sleep to-night with light hearts, Caroline! Yes. Soften it as they would, their hearts were lighter. The children's faces, hushed and clustered round to hear what they so little understood, were brighter. And when they had told them what they meant, they showed them a miracle of gladness.

They entered poor Bob Cratchit’s house; the dwelling he had visited before; and found the mother and the children seated round the fire.\nQuiet. Very quiet. The noisy little Cratchits were as still as statues in one corner, and sat looking up at Peter, who had a book before him. The mother and her daughters were engaged in sewing. But surely they were very quiet!\n“ ‘And He took a child, and set him in the midst of them.’ ”\nWhere had Scrooge heard those words? He had not dreamed them. The boy must have read them out, as he and the Spirit crossed the threshold. Why did he not go on?\nThe mother laid her work upon the table, and put her hand up to her face.\n“The colour hurts my eyes,” she said.\nThe colour? Ah, poor Tiny Tim!\n“They’re better now again,” said Cratchit’s wife. “It makes them weak by candle-light; and I wouldn’t show weak eyes to your father when he comes home, for the world. It must be near his time.”\n“Past it rather,” Peter answered, shutting up his book. “But I think he has walked a little slower than he used, these few last evenings, mother.”\nThey were very quiet again. At last she said, and in a steady, cheerful voice, that only faltered once:\n“I have known him walk with—I have known him walk with Tiny Tim upon his shoulder, very fast indeed.”\n“And so have I,” cried Peter. “Often.”\n“And so have I,” exclaimed another. So had all.\n“But he was very light to carry,” she resumed, intent upon her work, “and his father loved him so, that it was no trouble: no trouble. And there is your father at the door!”\nShe hurried out to meet him; and little Bob in his comforter—he had need of it, poor fellow—came in. His tea was ready for him on the hob, and they all tried who should help him to it most. Then the two young Cratchits got upon his knees and laid, each child a little cheek, against his face, as if they said, “Don’t mind it, father. Don’t be grieved!”\nBob was very cheerful with them, and spoke pleasantly to all the family. He looked at the work upon the table, and praised the industry and speed of Mrs. Cratchit and the girls. They would be done long before Sunday, he said.\n“Sunday! You went to-day, then, Robert?” said his wife.\n“Yes, my dear,” returned Bob. “I wish you could have gone. It would have done you good to see how green a place it is. But you’ll see it often. I promised him that I would walk there on a Sunday. My little, little child!” cried Bob. “My little child!”\nHe broke down all at once. He couldn’t help it. If he could have helped it, he and his child would have been farther apart perhaps than they were.\nHe left the room, and went up-stairs into the room above, which was lighted cheerfully, and hung with Christmas. There was a chair set close beside the child, and there were signs of some one having been there, lately. Poor Bob sat down in it, and when he had thought a little and composed himself, he kissed the little face. He was reconciled to what had happened, and went down again quite happy.\nThey drew about the fire, and talked; the girls and mother working still. Bob told them of the extraordinary kindness of Mr. Scrooge’s nephew, whom he had scarcely seen but once, and who, meeting him in the street that day, and seeing that he looked a little—“just a little down you know,” said Bob, inquired what had happened to distress him. “On which,” said Bob, “for he is the pleasantest-spoken gentleman you ever heard, I told him. ‘I am heartily sorry for it, Mr. Cratchit,’ he said, ‘and heartily sorry for your good wife.’ By the bye, how he ever knew that, I don’t know.”\n“Knew what, my dear?”\n“Why, that you were a good wife,” replied Bob.\n“Everybody knows that!” said Peter.\n“Very well observed, my boy!” cried Bob. “I hope they do. ‘Heartily sorry,’ he said, ‘for your good wife. If I can be of service to you in any way,’ he said, giving me his card, ‘that’s where I live. Pray come to me.’ Now, it wasn’t,” cried Bob, “for the sake of anything he might be able to do for us, so much as for his kind way, that this was quite delightful. It really seemed as if he had known our Tiny Tim, and felt with us.”\n“I’m sure he’s a good soul!” said Mrs. Cratchit.\n“You would be surer of it, my dear,” returned Bob, “if you saw and spoke to him. I shouldn’t be at all surprised—mark what I say!—if he got Peter a better situation.”\n“Only hear that, Peter,” said Mrs. Cratchit.\n“And then,” cried one of the girls, “Peter will be keeping company with some one, and setting up for himself.”\n“Get along with you!” retorted Peter, grinning.\n“It’s just as likely as not,” said Bob, “one of these days; though there’s plenty of time for that, my dear. But however and whenever we part from one another, I am sure we shall none of us forget poor Tiny Tim—shall we—or this first parting that there was among us?”\n“Never, father!” cried they all.\n“And I know,” said Bob, “I know, my dears, that when we recollect how patient and how mild he was; although he was a little, little child; we shall not quarrel easily among ourselves, and forget poor Tiny Tim in doing it.”\n“No, never, father!” they all cried again.\n“I am very happy,” said little Bob, “I am very happy!”\nMrs. Cratchit kissed him, his daughters kissed him, the two young Cratchits kissed him, and Peter and himself shook hands. Spirit of Tiny Tim, thy childish essence was from God!",

The Spirit stopped at last at the door of a dwelling with an iron railing before it, and a little patch of garden back and front, on which some few poor flowers tried to make a show of colour in the scanty earth. It was a house of mourning, and the Spirit led him up the stairs into a room. He was expected, and had expected the Ghost, and was ready.\n\nA pale light, rising in the outer air, fell straight upon the bed; and on it, plundered and bereft, watched, wept, and cared for, was the body of this unknown man. Scrooge looked intently at the Spirit, and was not more alarmed for himself, but for the great array of humble homes from which the Spirit had just now brought him. He thought of the Cratchit’s; but they were not there. He thought of the Cratchit’s again, and thought how they might be affected by the death of this unknown man. But they were not there either.\n\nThe Spirit signed to him to approach the bed; and Scrooge did so, trembling. The cover was so carelessly adjusted that the slightest raising of it, the motion of a finger upon Scrooge’s part, would have disclosed the face. He thought of it; felt how easy it would be to do; and longed to do it; but had no power to withdraw the veil, or lift the curtain. The Spirit sat beside the bed, and pointed to the head.

The Spirit stopped at last at the door of a dwelling with an iron railing before it, and a little patch of garden back and front, on which some few poor flowers tried to make a show of colour in the scanty earth. It was a house of mourning, and the Spirit led him up the stairs into a room. He was expected, and had expected the Ghost, and was ready.\n\nA pale light, rising in the outer air, fell straight upon the bed; and on it, plundered and bereft, watched, wept, and cared for, was the body of this unknown man. Scrooge looked intently at the Spirit, and was not more alarmed for himself, but for the great array of humble homes from which the Spirit had just now brought him. He thought of the Cratchit’s; but they were not there. He thought of the Cratchit’s again, and thought how they might be affected by the death of this unknown man.

Don't tell them who sent it, mind you. And here's a shilling for your trouble, and a shilling for yourself!\" He pressed the coins into the man's hand, his face alight with generosity. He watched the man hurry off with the turkey, a warmth spreading through his chest unlike anything he had ever known. This was living! This was joy! He felt like a boy again, full of mischief and good humour. He dressed himself in his best clothes, humming a tune, and stepped out into the street, ready to embrace the world and make amends. The past was past; the future was his to shape, filled with kindness and good cheer."

                "refinement_prompt": "IMPROVEMENT GUIDANCE:\n1. MAJOR STRUCTURAL ISSUES:\n- In the middle section, the completion introduces invented descriptions about the city and the crowd, such as references to an 'inundation of good-humour' and the idea that Scrooge was the merriest among dozens of people. These elaborations are not present in the original and shift the focus away from the specific interactions described.\n- The completion also invents details about Scrooge's emotional state, such as being 'so fluttered and so glowing with his good intentions,' which are not part of the original passage.\n\n2. MISSING ELEMENTS:\n- The completion omits the specific detail that Scrooge walked with his hands behind him, which is a notable physical action in the original sequence.\n- It also misses the detail that three or four good-humoured fellows specifically greeted Scrooge, instead generalizing the number and nature of greetings.\n\n3. INACCURATE ELEMENTS:\n- The completion inaccurately increases the number of people who greet Scrooge, changing it from a small group to a dozen or more, which alters the scale of the interaction.\n- There is a shift in perspective regarding how people viewed Scrooge; the completion suggests universal delight, whereas the original is more specific and limited in scope.\n- The sequence of events is slightly altered by the addition of invented crowd descriptions before the greetings, which changes the flow of the passage.\n- The completion attributes additional emotional responses and physical descriptions to Scrooge that are not present in the original, such as his face being 'wreathed in smiles' and his eyes 'sparkling brightly.'"

He was on his stool in a jiffy; driving away with his pen, as if he were trying to overtake nine o’clock.\n“Hallo!” growled Scrooge, in his accustomed voice, as near as he could feign it. “What do you mean by coming here at this time of day?”\n“I am very sorry, sir,” said Bob. “I am behind my time.”\n“You are?” repeated Scrooge. “Yes. I think you are. Step this way, sir, if you please.”\n“It’s only once a year, sir,” pleaded Bob, appearing from the Tank. “It shall not be repeated. I was making rather merry yesterday, sir.”\n“Now, I’ll tell you what, my friend,” said Scrooge, “I am not going to stand this sort of thing any longer. And therefore,” he continued, leaping from his stool, and giving Bob such a dig in the waistcoat that he staggered back into the Tank again; “and therefore I am about to raise your salary!”\nBob trembled, and got a little nearer to the ruler. He had a momentary idea of knocking Scrooge down with it, holding him, and calling to the people in the court for help and a strait-waistcoat.\n“A merry Christmas, Bob!” said Scrooge, with an earnestness that could not be mistaken, as he clapped him on the back. “A merrier Christmas, Bob, my good fellow, than I have given you, for many a year! I’ll raise your salary, and endeavour to assist your struggling family, and we will discuss your affairs this very afternoon, over a Christmas bowl of smoking bishop, Bob! Make up the fires, and buy another coal-scuttle before you dot another i, Bob Cratchit!”",
