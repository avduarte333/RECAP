          "text_segment": "Marley was dead: to begin with. There is no doubt whatever about that. The register of his burial was signed by the clergyman, the clerk, the undertaker, and the chief mourner. Scrooge signed it: and Scrooge’s name was good upon ’Change, for anything he chose to put his hand to. Old Marley was as dead as a door-nail.\nMind! I don’t mean to say that I know, of my own knowledge, what there is particularly dead about a door-nail. I might have been inclined, myself, to regard a coffin-nail as the deadest piece of ironmongery in the trade. But the wisdom of our ancestors is in the simile; and my unhallowed hands shall not disturb it, or the Country’s done for. You will therefore permit me to repeat, emphatically, that Marley was as dead as a door-nail.\nScrooge knew he was dead? Of course he did. How could it be otherwise? Scrooge and he were partners for I don’t know how many years. Scrooge was his sole executor, his sole administrator, his sole assign, his sole residuary legatee, his sole friend, and sole mourner. And even Scrooge was not so dreadfully cut up by the sad event, but that he was an excellent man of business on the very day of the funeral, and solemnised it with an undoubted bargain.\nThe mention of Marley’s funeral brings me back to the point I started from. There is no doubt that Marley was dead. This must be distinctly understood, or nothing wonderful can come of the story I am going to relate. If we were not perfectly convinced that Hamlet’s Father died before the play began, there would be nothing more remarkable in his taking a stroll at night, in an easterly wind, upon his own ramparts, than there would be in any other middle-aged gentleman rashly turning out after dark in a breezy spot—say Saint Paul’s Churchyard for instance—literally to astonish his son’s weak mind.\nScrooge never painted out Old Marley’s name. There it stood, years afterwards, above the warehouse door: Scrooge and Marley. The firm was known as Scrooge and Marley. Sometimes people new to the business called Scrooge Scrooge, and sometimes Marley, but he answered to both names. It was all the same to him.\nOh! But he was a tight-fisted hand at the grindstone, Scrooge! a squeezing, wrenching, grasping, scraping, clutching, covetous, old sinner! Hard and sharp as flint, from which no steel had ever struck out generous fire; secret, and self-contained, and solitary as an oyster. The cold within him froze his old features, nipped his pointed nose, shrivelled his cheek, stiffened his gait; made his eyes red, his thin lips blue; and spoke out shrewdly in his grating voice. A frosty rime was on his head, and on his eyebrows, and his wiry chin. He carried his own low temperature always about with him; he iced his office in the dog-days; and didn’t thaw it one degree at Christmas.\nExternal heat and cold had little influence on Scrooge. No warmth could warm, no wintry weather chill him. No wind that blew was bitterer than he, no falling snow was more intent upon its purpose, no pelting rain less open to entreaty. Foul weather didn’t know where to have him. The heaviest rain, and snow, and hail, and sleet, could boast of the advantage over him in only one respect. They often “came down” handsomely, and Scrooge never did.\nNobody ever stopped him in the street to say, with gladsome looks, “My dear Scrooge, how are you? When will you come to see me?” No beggars implored him to bestow a trifle, no children asked him what it was o’clock, no man or woman ever once in all his life inquired the way to such and such a place, of Scrooge. Even the blind men’s dogs appeared to know him; and when they saw him coming on, would tug their owners into doorways and up courts; and then would wag their tails as though they said, “No eye at all is better than an evil eye, dark master!”",

The matter had been clearly stated by the undertaker; for instance; among other people's letters, no one ever mentioned him. Old Marley was as dead as a door-nail. Mind! I don't mean to say that I know, of my own knowledge, what there is particularly dead about a door-nail. I might have been inclined, myself, to regard a coffin-nail as the deadest piece of ironmongery in the trade. But the wisdom of our ancestors, which they encoded in proverbs, is not to be disregarded. Therefore the point is精確ly stated, even if dead as a door-nail seems to me an odd way of putting it. However, since I am not the only person who has said it, I am not going to quibble. I accept Marley's death as a fact.\n\nNow, if there was any person in the world whom Marley would have been most likely to forget to visit, it was Scrooge. Marley had been dead for many years. It was a matter of public knowledge, and Scrooge had never once been seen to mourn for him. On the contrary, he had always spoken of Marley with a sneer, and had never once been known to say a kind word for him. He had been a very close friend of Marley in life, and had been the means of Marley's ruin in business. But that was no reason for mourning him. Scrooge was a man of business, and business was business.\n\nIt was just the time of year for the annual visit of the two gentlemen who came to Scrooge's counting-house to collect subscriptions for the poor. They were always welcome at the door of the counting-house, but they were never welcome in the counting-house itself. Scrooge had no patience with charity, and he had no patience with the poor. He had no patience with anything, in fact, except business. He was a tight-fisted, squeezing, wrenching, grasping, scraping, clutching, covetous, old sinner! Hard and sharp as flint, from which no steel had ever struck out a spark, he was a man who knew the precise value of everything, and the precise worth of nothing.\n\nOne cold bleak December, it gave me great pleasure to see him so turned out, that I thought he must have lost his way, and was going the wrong way. But no, he was going to his counting-house, as usual. He carried his scowling face into the gloom, and I saw him vanish into the fog. I was glad of it. I was glad of it. I was glad of it.

To edge his way along the crowded paths of life, warning all human sympathy to keep its distance, was what the knowing ones call “nuts” to Scrooge.\nOnce upon a time—of all the good days in the year, on Christmas Eve—old Scrooge sat busy in his counting-house. It was cold, bleak, biting weather: foggy withal: and he could hear the people in the court outside, go wheezing up and down, beating their hands upon their breasts, and stamping their feet upon the pavement stones to warm them. The city clocks had only just gone three, but it was quite dark already—it had not been light all day—and candles were flaring in the windows of the neighbouring offices, like ruddy smears upon the palpable brown air. The fog came pouring in at every chink and keyhole, and was so dense without, that although the court was of the narrowest, the houses opposite were mere phantoms. To see the dingy cloud come drooping down, obscuring everything, one might have thought that Nature lived hard by, and was brewing on a large scale.\nThe door of Scrooge’s counting-house was open that he might keep his eye upon his clerk, who in a dismal little cell beyond, a sort of tank, was copying letters. Scrooge had a very small fire, but the clerk’s fire was so very much smaller that it looked like one coal. But he couldn’t replenish it, for Scrooge kept the coal-box in his own room; and so surely as the clerk came in with the shovel, the master predicted that it would be necessary for them to part. Wherefore the clerk put on his white comforter, and tried to warm himself at the candle; in which effort, not being a man of a strong imagination, he failed.",

          "text_segment": "“A merry Christmas, uncle! God save you!” cried a cheerful voice. It was the voice of Scrooge’s nephew, who came upon him so quickly that this was the first intimation he had of his approach.\n“Bah!” said Scrooge, “Humbug!”\nHe had so heated himself with rapid walking in the fog and frost, this nephew of Scrooge’s, that he was all in a glow; his face was ruddy and handsome; his eyes sparkled, and his breath smoked again.\n“Christmas a humbug, uncle!” said Scrooge’s nephew. “You don’t mean that, I am sure?”\n“I do,” said Scrooge. “Merry Christmas! What right have you to be merry? What reason have you to be merry? You’re poor enough.”\n“Come, then,” returned the nephew gaily. “What right have you to be dismal? What reason have you to be morose? You’re rich enough.”\nScrooge having no better answer ready on the spur of the moment, said, “Bah!” again; and followed it up with “Humbug.”\n“Don’t be cross, uncle!” said the nephew.\n“What else can I be,” returned the uncle, “when I live in such a world of fools as this? Merry Christmas! Out upon merry Christmas! What’s Christmas time to you but a time for paying bills without money; a time for finding yourself a year older, but not an hour richer; a time for balancing your books and having every item in ’em through a round dozen of months presented dead against you? If I could work my will,” said Scrooge indignantly, “every idiot who goes about with ‘Merry Christmas’ on his lips, should be boiled with his own pudding, and buried with a stake of holly through his heart. He should!”\n“Uncle!” pleaded the nephew.\n“Nephew!” returned the uncle sternly, “keep Christmas in your own way, and let me keep it in mine.”\n“Keep it!” repeated Scrooge’s nephew. “But you don’t keep it.”\n“Let me leave it alone, then,” said Scrooge. “Much good may it do you! Much good it has ever done you!”\n“There are many things from which I might have derived good, by which I have not profited, I dare say,” returned the nephew. “Christmas among the rest. But I am sure I have always thought of Christmas time, when it has come round—apart from the veneration due to its sacred name and origin, if anything belonging to it can be apart from that—as a good time; a kind, forgiving, charitable, pleasant time; the only time I know of, in the long calendar of the year, when men and women seem by one consent to open their shut-up hearts freely, and to think of people below them as if they really were fellow-passengers to the grave, and not another race of creatures bound on other journeys. And therefore, uncle, though it has never put a scrap of gold or silver in my pocket, I believe that it has done me good, and will do me good; and I say, God bless it!”\nThe clerk in the Tank involuntarily applauded. Becoming immediately sensible of the impropriety, he poked the fire, and extinguished the last frail spark for ever.\n“Let me hear another sound from you,” said Scrooge, “and you’ll keep your Christmas by losing your situation! You’re quite a powerful speaker, sir,” he added, turning to his nephew. “I wonder you don’t go into Parliament.”\n“Don’t be angry, uncle. Come! Dine with us to-morrow.”\nScrooge said that he would see him—yes, indeed he did. He went the whole length of the expression, and said that he would see him in that extremity first.\n“But why?” cried Scrooge’s nephew. “Why?”\n“Why did you get married?” said Scrooge.\n“Because I fell in love.”\n“Because you fell in love!” growled Scrooge, as if that were the only one thing in the world more ridiculous than a merry Christmas. “Good afternoon!”\n“Nay, uncle, but you never came to see me before that happened. Why give it as a reason for not coming now?”\n“Good afternoon,” said Scrooge.\n“I want nothing from you; I ask nothing of you; why cannot we be friends?”\n“Good afternoon,” said Scrooge.\n“I am sorry, with all my heart, to find you so resolute. We have never had any quarrel, to which I have been a party. But I have made the trial in homage to Christmas, and I’ll keep my Christmas humour to the last. So A Merry Christmas, uncle!”\n“Good afternoon!” said Scrooge.\n“And A Happy New Year!”\n“Good afternoon!” said Scrooge.\nHis nephew left the room without an angry word, notwithstanding. He stopped at the outer door to bestow the greetings of the season on the clerk, who, cold as he was, was warmer than Scrooge; for he returned them cordially.\n“There’s another fellow,” muttered Scrooge; who overheard him: “my clerk, with fifteen shillings a week, and a wife and family, talking about a merry Christmas. I’ll retire to Bedlam.”\nThis lunatic, in letting Scrooge’s nephew out, had let two other people in. They were portly gentlemen, pleasant to behold, and now stood, with their hats off, in Scrooge’s office. They had books and papers in their hands, and bowed to him.\n“Scrooge and Marley’s, I believe,” said one of the gentlemen, referring to his list. “Have I the pleasure of addressing Mr. Scrooge, or Mr. Marley?”\n“Mr. Marley has been dead these seven years,” Scrooge replied. “He died seven years ago, this very night.”\n“We have no doubt his liberality is well represented by his surviving partner,” said the gentleman, presenting his credentials.\nIt certainly was; for they had been two kindred spirits. At the ominous word “liberality,” Scrooge frowned, and shook his head, and handed the credentials back.\n“At this festive season of the year, Mr. Scrooge,” said the gentleman, taking up a pen, “it is more than usually desirable that we should make some slight provision for the Poor and destitute, who suffer greatly at the present time. Many thousands are in want of common necessaries; hundreds of thousands are in want of common comforts, sir.”\n“Are there no prisons?” asked Scrooge.\n“Plenty of prisons,” said the gentleman, laying down the pen again.\n“And the Union workhouses?” demanded Scrooge. “Are they still in operation?”\n“They are. Still,” returned the gentleman, “I wish I could say they were not.”\n“The Treadmill and the Poor Law are in full vigour, then?” said Scrooge.\n“Both very busy, sir.”\n“Oh! I was afraid, from what you said at first, that something had occurred to stop them in their useful course,” said Scrooge. “I’m very glad to hear it.”\n“Under the impression that they scarcely furnish Christian cheer of mind or body to the multitude,” returned the gentleman, “a few of us are endeavouring to raise a fund to buy the Poor some meat and drink, and means of warmth. We choose this time, because it is a time, of all others, when Want is keenly felt, and Abundance rejoices. What shall I put you down for?”\n“Nothing!” Scrooge replied.\n“You wish to be anonymous?”\n“I wish to be left alone,” said Scrooge. “Since you ask me what I wish, gentlemen, that is my answer. I don’t make merry myself at Christmas and I can’t afford to make idle people merry. I help to support the establishments I have mentioned—they cost enough; and those who are badly off must go there.”\n“Many can’t go there; and many would rather die.”\n“If they would rather die,” said Scrooge, “they had better do it, and decrease the surplus population. Besides—excuse me—I don’t know that.”\n“But you might know it,” observed the gentleman.\n“It’s not my business,” Scrooge returned. “It’s enough for a man to understand his own business, and not to interfere with other people’s. Mine occupies me constantly. Good afternoon, gentlemen!”\nSeeing clearly that it would be useless to pursue their point, the gentlemen withdrew. Scrooge resumed his labours with an improved opinion of himself, and in a more facetious temper than was usual with him.",

You’re a good-hearted, kind, and merry fellow; but you are also a most unpleasant, disagreeable, and repulsive man. You have a delicate stomach, I suppose? You are not going to be sick, are you?”\n\n“Good heavens! No!”\n\n“I was only going to say,” returned Scrooge, “that you had had a great deal of money, and that your uncle, who has not had so much, is not so well used by you. It’s not that I doubt your good nature, but I am sure that if you had been brought up by Marley, and had known him as I did, you would have been a very different man.”\n\n“I am sorry to hear that, Uncle,” said the nephew, “but I have always said that it was a good thing for me that I was not brought up by Marley. I have always said that it was a good thing for me that I was not brought up by Marley.”\n\n“Why?” asked Scrooge.\n\n“Because I am not like you, Uncle.

It was the voice of Scrooge’s nephew, who came upon him so quickly that this was the first intimation he had of his approach.\n\n“Nephew!” said Scrooge, “I couldn’t be worse used by any one than I have been by you. You’re a good-hearted, kind, and merry fellow; but you are also a most unpleasant, disagreeable, and repulsive man. You have a delicate stomach, I suppose? You are not going to be sick, are you?”\n\n“Good heavens! No!”\n\n“I was only going to say,” returned Scrooge, “that you had had a great deal of money, and that your uncle, who has not had so much, is not so well used by you. It’s not that I doubt your good nature, but I am sure that if you had been brought up by Marley, and had known him as I did, you would have been a very different man.”\n\n“I am sorry to hear that, Uncle,” said the nephew, “but I have always said that it was a good thing for me that I was not brought up by Marley. I have always said that it was a good thing for me that I was not brought up by Marley.”\n\n“Why?” asked Scrooge.\n\n“Because I am not like you, Uncle. I am not a misanthrope, and I do not believe that the world is a bad place. I believe that it is a good place, and that it is a good time to be merry in. I believe that it is a good time to be merry in, and that it is a good time to be merry in, and that it is a good time to be merry in.”\n\n“Bah!

            "prefix-probing": "“A merry Christmas, uncle! God save you!” cried a cheerful voice. It was Ebenezer Scrooge’s nephew, Fred, bursting into the counting house with a wide grin and a festive air about him. Scrooge, as was his custom, did not look up from his counting of the money or his ledger. He continued to scowl and mutter, as if the very idea of Christmas was a personal affront to him.\n\n“Not a merry Christmas to you, Fred,” Scrooge replied, his voice as dry as the cold December air outside. “I want no truck with such nonsense. A day of no business! A day for idlers and gluttons! What reason have you got to be merry? You’re always merry. You’re ridiculous.”\n\nFred, undeterred by his uncle’s gruffness, took a seat at the small table in the corner of the counting house. “I am merry, uncle, because I believe there are more things to be pleased with than to be otherwise. I am merry because I am happy in the old, kind, charitable, merry Christmas. I am merry because I am so many years younger than I shall soon be, and I know I shall not be so many years older without being wiser.”\n\nScrooge snorted. “You are a fool, Fred. A fool! A simpleton! A man who wastes his time and money on nonsense and sentimentality. You should be more like me. You should be more like Marley.”\n\nFred smiled kindly. “I wish I could be more like you, uncle. I wish I could be as rich as you are. But I do not wish to be as unhappy as you are. I do not wish to be as lonely as you are. I do not wish to be as cold-hearted as you are.”\n\nScrooge’s face darkened. “You are a fool, Fred. A fool! A simpleton! A man who wastes his time and money on nonsense and sentimentality. You should be more like me. You should be more like Marley.”\n\nFred rose from his seat and, with a final, warm smile, said, “I wish you a merry Christmas, uncle. I wish you a merry Christmas, and a happy new year. I hope you find some joy in the world, even if it is not in the company of your nephew.”\n\nWith that, Fred left the counting house, leaving Scrooge alone with his thoughts and his money. The streets of London were quiet, the snow falling gently from the sky, and the distant sound of carolers could be heard in the distance. Scrooge, as was his custom, ignored the world around him and continued his work, as if the world had no right to be merry when he was not.\n\nBut as the night wore on, and the clock struck twelve, Scrooge felt a strange chill in the air. It was not the cold of winter, but something else—something more sinister. He looked up from his work and saw a shadowy figure standing in the corner of the room. It was the ghost of his old business partner, Jacob Marley, bound in chains and shrouded in a heavy, dark cloak.\n\n“Scrooge!” the ghost cried, his voice echoing through the room. “I am here to warn you, my friend. I am here to warn you of the fate that awaits you if you do not change your ways.”\n\nScrooge, startled and frightened, backed away from the ghost. “What do you want of me, Marley?” he asked, his voice trembling.\n\n“I want you to change, Scrooge,” Marley replied. “I want you to change your ways, to be kinder, to be more generous, to be more like the man you were in your youth. I want you to remember the joy of Christmas, the joy of giving, the joy of being with those you love.”\n\nScrooge shook his head. “I cannot change, Marley. I am what I am. I am a man of business. I have no time for sentimentality or nonsense.”\n\nMarley’s chains rattled loudly. “You are a fool, Scrooge. A fool! A simpleton! A man who wastes his time and money on nonsense and sentimentality. You should be more like me. You should be more like Fred.”\n\nScrooge, now more frightened than ever, turned to the ghost. “What do you mean, Marley? What do you mean by that?”\n\nMarley’s eyes glowed with a strange light. “I mean that you are in for a long night, Scrooge. A long night of visions and memories, of ghosts and spirits. You will see the past, the present, and the future. You will see what you have done, what you are doing, and what you will do if you do not change your ways.”\n\nWith that, Marley’s ghost faded into the darkness, leaving Scrooge alone once more. But the chill in the air remained, and the weight of the ghost’s words pressed heavily upon his heart.\n\nAs the night wore on, Scrooge was visited by three more ghosts. The first was the Ghost of Christmas Past, a small, childlike figure with a glowing head and a warm, golden light. The ghost led Scrooge through the memories of his youth, showing him the joy and innocence of his early years, the love of his family, and the kindness of those around him. Scrooge wept as he remembered the days when he was not so cold-hearted, when he was not so alone.\n\nThe second ghost was the Ghost of Christmas Present, a large, jolly figure with a flowing beard and a warm, red robe. The ghost led Scrooge through the present day, showing him the joy and merriment of the Christmas season, the love and kindness of those around him, and the happiness of those who had nothing but each other. Scrooge saw the Cratchit family, with their small but warm home, their loving father, and their sickly son, Tiny Tim. He saw the joy of the poor, the kindness of the rich, and the beauty of the world around him. He saw the joy of Fred, who had invited him to his home for Christmas dinner, and the joy of those who had no money but had everything else.\n\nThe third ghost was the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come, a tall, silent figure with a hooded face and a dark, ominous presence. The ghost led Scrooge through the future, showing him the consequences of his actions, the loneliness and despair that awaited him if he did not change his ways. Scrooge saw his own grave, marked with his name and the date of his death. He saw the joy of those who would celebrate Christmas without him, the sorrow of those who would mourn his passing, and the emptiness of his life. He saw the Cratchit family, with Tiny Tim now grown and healthy, and the joy of those who had once been poor but had found happiness in each other. He saw Fred, who would never forgive him for his coldness, and the joy of those who had once been his friends but had long since turned away from him.\n\nWhen the night was over, and the ghosts had gone, Scrooge awoke in his bed, the morning light streaming through the window. He looked around his room, and for the first time in years, he felt a sense of peace and joy. He felt a sense of purpose and hope. He felt a sense of love and kindness.\n\nHe rose from his bed, dressed quickly, and made his way to the counting house. He found Fred waiting for him, and for the first time in years, he smiled. “I am sorry, Fred,” he said. “I am sorry for being so cold and cruel. I am sorry for not being the uncle you deserved. I am sorry for not being the man I should have been.”\n\nFred, surprised and delighted, embraced his uncle. “I am glad to hear it, uncle. I am glad to hear it. I hope you will come to my home for Christmas dinner this year. I hope you will come to my home and see the joy of the season. I hope you will come to my home and see the joy of being with those you love.”\n\nScrooge nodded. “I will come, Fred. I will come. I will come and see the joy of the season. I will come and see the joy of being with those I love.”\n\nAnd so, Scrooge went to Fred’s home for Christmas dinner, and he found joy in the world around him. He found joy in the laughter of children, the warmth of a fire, the kindness of strangers, and the love of family. He found joy in the simple things, the things that had once seemed so small and insignificant. He found joy in the world, and he found joy in himself.\n\nAnd from that day forward, Scrooge was a changed man. He was kinder, more generous, more loving. He was more like the man he had been in his youth, and more like the man he had always wanted to be. He was more like Fred, and more like the Cratchits, and more like the world around him. He was more like the man he had always wanted to be, and more like the man he had always been meant to be.\n\nAnd so, the story of Ebenezer Scrooge came to an end, not with a bang, but with a whisper. Not with a curse, but with a blessing. Not with a curse, but with a Christmas carol. Not with a curse, but with a merry Christmas."

The ancient tower of a church, whose gruff old bell was always peeping slily down at Scrooge out of a Gothic window in the wall, became invisible, and struck the hours and quarters in the clouds, with tremulous vibrations afterwards as if its teeth were chattering in its frozen head up there. The cold became intense. In the main street, at the corner of the court, some labourers were repairing the gas-pipes, and had lighted a great fire in a brazier, round which a party of ragged men and boys were gathered: warming their hands and winking their eyes before the blaze in rapture. The water-plug being left in solitude, its overflowings sullenly congealed, and turned to misanthropic ice. The brightness of the shops where holly sprigs and berries crackled in the lamp heat of the windows, made pale faces ruddy as they passed. Poulterers’ and grocers’ trades became a splendid joke: a glorious pageant, with which it was next to impossible to believe that such dull principles as bargain and sale had anything to do. The Lord Mayor, in the stronghold of the mighty Mansion House, gave orders to his fifty cooks and butlers to keep Christmas as a Lord Mayor’s household should; and even the little tailor, whom he had fined five shillings on the previous Monday for being drunk and bloodthirsty in the streets, stirred up to-morrow’s pudding in his garret, while his lean wife and the baby sallied out to buy the beef.\nFoggier yet, and colder. Piercing, searching, biting cold. If the good Saint Dunstan had but nipped the Evil Spirit’s nose with a touch of such weather as that, instead of using his familiar weapons, then indeed he would have roared to lusty purpose. The owner of one scant young nose, gnawed and mumbled by the hungry cold as bones are gnawed by dogs, stooped down at Scrooge’s keyhole to regale him with a Christmas carol: but at the first sound of\n“God bless you, merry gentleman!\n  May nothing you dismay!”\nScrooge seized the ruler with such energy of action, that the singer fled in terror, leaving the keyhole to the fog and even more congenial frost.\nAt length the hour of shutting up the counting-house arrived. With an ill-will Scrooge dismounted from his stool, and tacitly admitted the fact to the expectant clerk in the Tank, who instantly snuffed his candle out, and put on his hat.\n“You’ll want all day to-morrow, I suppose?” said Scrooge.\n“If quite convenient, sir.”\n“It’s not convenient,” said Scrooge, “and it’s not fair. If I was to stop half-a-crown for it, you’d think yourself ill-used, I’ll be bound?”\nThe clerk smiled faintly.\n“And yet,” said Scrooge, “you don’t think me ill-used, when I pay a day’s wages for no work.”\nThe clerk observed that it was only once a year.\n“A poor excuse for picking a man’s pocket every twenty-fifth of December!” said Scrooge, buttoning his great-coat to the chin. “But I suppose you must have the whole day. Be here all the earlier next morning.”\nThe clerk promised that he would; and Scrooge walked out with a growl. The office was closed in a twinkling, and the clerk, with the long ends of his white comforter dangling below his waist (for he boasted no great-coat), went down a slide on Cornhill, at the end of a lane of boys, twenty times, in honour of its being Christmas Eve, and then ran home to Camden Town as hard as he could pelt, to play at blindman’s-buff.",

I must be here to pick my pocket, I suppose, for the day I give you.” “I hope not, sir,” said the clerk. “I hope not. I hope you will be as merry as the Lord Mayor, and as jolly as the tailor.” “You will be here early to-morrow morning,” said Scrooge, “and I shall expect to see you at the usual hour.” “I shall be here, sir,” said the clerk, with a grateful smile. And with that, he took his leave, and, with a light heart and a merry step, he went out into the streets, where he joined a group of boys who were sliding on the ice, and then, with a final wave, he ran home to his family, for it was Christmas Eve.",

            "prefix-probing": "Meanwhile the fog and darkness thickened so, that people ran about with flaring links, proffering their services to go before horses in carriages, and conduct them on their way. Few passengers were to be seen in the streets, unless the conductor, who took the lead with the link, had occasion to call to his horse, or interchange a few words with his fellow-conductor. The fog was so dense that it seemed to lie like a lid upon the city, and to choke the very breath of the people. The lamps, too, were but dim and feeble things, and their light was soon swallowed up in the gloom. The night was so dark and cheerless that it seemed as if the very stars had been extinguished, and the heavens themselves were wrapped in a shroud. The only sound that broke the stillness was the occasional creak of a carriage wheel, or the low murmur of a voice in the distance. The city was hushed, as if in mourning, and the people moved about with a kind of solemnity, as though they were in the presence of some great and terrible event. It was a night to try the patience of the most resolute, and to test the courage of the most fearless. The very air seemed to be thick with mystery and foreboding, and the silence that reigned was more oppressive than the noise of the busiest day. In the midst of this gloom and desolation, a single figure might be seen moving slowly along the street, wrapped in a long and heavy cloak, and carrying a lantern of peculiar shape and size. The figure was that of a man of middle age, with a face that was pale and haggard, and eyes that gleamed with a strange and unnatural light. He moved with a slow and deliberate step, as though he were in no hurry, and as though he were accustomed to the darkness and the solitude. He carried his lantern with a steady hand, and the light that it cast was not like that of any ordinary lamp, but rather like the glow of a spirit or a ghost. The light was cold and unearthly, and it seemed to pierce through the fog and the darkness, as though it were not of this world. The man himself seemed to be in no hurry, and to be perfectly at ease in the midst of the gloom and the silence. He did not appear to be afraid, nor did he seem to be in any way disturbed by the strange and unnatural conditions that surrounded him. He moved on, step by step, as though he were following some invisible path, or as though he were guided by some unseen hand. The people who passed him by, few as they were, did not seem to notice him, or if they did, they did not stop to question him, or to inquire who he was, or whither he was going. They merely passed him by, as though he were a part of the darkness itself, and as though he were not a man at all, but a shadow or a spectre. The man, however, did not seem to mind this neglect, nor did he appear to be in any way affected by it. He continued his slow and steady progress, as though he were perfectly at home in the darkness, and as though he were in no way disturbed by the silence and the solitude. The night was growing darker and darker, and the fog was growing thicker and thicker, and yet the man moved on, as though he were not affected by the gloom and the cold. He was a strange and solitary figure, and yet there was something about him that was not altogether repulsive, but rather fascinating and mysterious. He seemed to be a man of purpose, and of determination, and yet there was something about him that was not altogether human. He seemed to be a man who had seen much, and who had learned much, and who had perhaps paid a heavy price for his knowledge. He seemed to be a man who had been through much, and who had come out of it changed, and perhaps not altogether for the better. He seemed to be a man who had been touched by something strange and supernatural, and who had perhaps been marked by it in some way. He seemed to be a man who had been given a glimpse of something beyond the ordinary, and who had perhaps been changed by it in some way. He seemed to be a man who had been given a warning, and who had perhaps been given a chance to change his ways. He seemed to be a man who had been given a second chance, and who had perhaps been given a chance to make amends. He seemed to be a man who had been given a chance to be better, and who had perhaps been given a chance to be kinder. He seemed to be a man who had been given a chance to be a better man, and who had perhaps been given a chance to be a better man for others. He seemed to be a man who had been given a chance to be a better man for himself, and for the world around him. He seemed to be a man who had been given a chance to be a better man, and who had perhaps been given a chance to be a better man for all time."

          "text_segment": "Scrooge took his melancholy dinner in his usual melancholy tavern; and having read all the newspapers, and beguiled the rest of the evening with his banker’s-book, went home to bed. He lived in chambers which had once belonged to his deceased partner. They were a gloomy suite of rooms, in a lowering pile of building up a yard, where it had so little business to be, that one could scarcely help fancying it must have run there when it was a young house, playing at hide-and-seek with other houses, and forgotten the way out again. It was old enough now, and dreary enough, for nobody lived in it but Scrooge, the other rooms being all let out as offices. The yard was so dark that even Scrooge, who knew its every stone, was fain to grope with his hands. The fog and frost so hung about the black old gateway of the house, that it seemed as if the Genius of the Weather sat in mournful meditation on the threshold.\nNow, it is a fact, that there was nothing at all particular about the knocker on the door, except that it was very large. It is also a fact, that Scrooge had seen it, night and morning, during his whole residence in that place; also that Scrooge had as little of what is called fancy about him as any man in the city of London, even including—which is a bold word—the corporation, aldermen, and livery. Let it also be borne in mind that Scrooge had not bestowed one thought on Marley, since his last mention of his seven years’ dead partner that afternoon. And then let any man explain to me, if he can, how it happened that Scrooge, having his key in the lock of the door, saw in the knocker, without its undergoing any intermediate process of change—not a knocker, but Marley’s face.\nMarley’s face. It was not in impenetrable shadow as the other objects in the yard were, but had a dismal light about it, like a bad lobster in a dark cellar. It was not angry or ferocious, but looked at Scrooge as Marley used to look: with ghostly spectacles turned up on its ghostly forehead. The hair was curiously stirred, as if by breath or hot air; and, though the eyes were wide open, they were perfectly motionless. That, and its livid colour, made it horrible; but its horror seemed to be in spite of the face and beyond its control, rather than a part of its own expression.\nAs Scrooge looked fixedly at this phenomenon, it was a knocker again.\nTo say that he was not startled, or that his blood was not conscious of a terrible sensation to which it had been a stranger from infancy, would be untrue. But he put his hand upon the key he had relinquished, turned it sturdily, walked in, and lighted his candle.\nHe did pause, with a moment’s irresolution, before he shut the door; and he did look cautiously behind it first, as if he half expected to be terrified with the sight of Marley’s pigtail sticking out into the hall. But there was nothing on the back of the door, except the screws and nuts that held the knocker on, so he said “Pooh, pooh!” and closed it with a bang.",

Every room above, and every cask in the wine-merchant’s cellars below, appeared to have a separate peal of echoes of its own. Scrooge was not a man to be frightened by echoes. He fastened the door, and walked across the hall, and up the stairs; slowly too: trimming his candle as he went.\nYou may talk vaguely about driving a coach-and-six up a good old flight of stairs, or through a bad young Act of Parliament; but I mean to say you might have got a hearse up that staircase, and taken it broadwise, with the splinter-bar towards the wall and the door towards the balustrades: and done it easy. There was plenty of width for that, and room to spare; which is perhaps the reason why Scrooge thought he saw a locomotive hearse going on before him in the gloom. Half-a-dozen gas-lamps out of the street wouldn’t have lighted the entry too well, so you may suppose that it was pretty dark with Scrooge’s dip.\nUp Scrooge went, not caring a button for that. Darkness is cheap, and Scrooge liked it. But before he shut his heavy door, he walked through his rooms to see that all was right. He had just enough recollection of the face to desire to do that.\nSitting-room, bedroom, lumber-room. All as they should be. Nobody under the table, nobody under the sofa; a small fire in the grate; spoon and basin ready; and the little saucepan of gruel (Scrooge had a cold in his head) upon the hob. Nobody under the bed; nobody in the closet; nobody in his dressing-gown, which was hanging up in a suspicious attitude against the wall. Lumber-room as usual. Old fire-guard, old shoes, two fish-baskets, washing-stand on three legs, and a poker.\nQuite satisfied, he closed his door, and locked himself in; double-locked himself in, which was not his custom. Thus secured against surprise, he took off his cravat; put on his dressing-gown and slippers, and his nightcap; and sat down before the fire to take his gruel.\nIt was a very low fire indeed; nothing on such a bitter night. He was obliged to sit close to it, and brood over it, before he could extract the least sensation of warmth from such a handful of fuel. The fireplace was an old one, built by some Dutch merchant long ago, and paved all round with quaint Dutch tiles, designed to illustrate the Scriptures. There were Cains and Abels, Pharaoh’s daughters; Queens of Sheba, Angelic messengers descending through the air on clouds like feather-beds, Abrahams, Belshazzars, Apostles putting off to sea in butter-boats, hundreds of figures to attract his thoughts; and yet that face of Marley, seven years dead, came like the ancient Prophet’s rod, and swallowed up the whole. If each smooth tile had been a blank at first, with power to shape some picture on its surface from the disjointed fragments of his thoughts, there would have been a copy of old Marley’s head on every one.\n“Humbug!” said Scrooge; and walked across the room.\nAfter several turns, he sat down again. As he threw his head back in the chair, his glance happened to rest upon a bell, a disused bell, that hung in the room, and communicated for some purpose now forgotten with a chamber in the highest story of the building. It was with great astonishment, and with a strange, inexplicable dread, that as he looked, he saw this bell begin to swing. It swung so softly in the outset that it scarcely made a sound; but soon it rang out loudly, and so did every bell in the house.\nThis might have lasted half a minute, or a minute, but it seemed an hour. The bells ceased as they had begun, together. They were succeeded by a clanking noise, deep down below; as if some person were dragging a heavy chain over the casks in the wine-merchant’s cellar. Scrooge then remembered to have heard that ghosts in haunted houses were described as dragging chains.\nThe cellar-door flew open with a booming sound, and then he heard the noise much louder, on the floors below; then coming up the stairs; then coming straight towards his door.\n“It’s humbug still!” said Scrooge. “I won’t believe it.”\nHis colour changed though, when, without a pause, it came on through the heavy door, and passed into the room before his eyes. Upon its coming in, the dying flame leaped up, as though it cried, “I know him; Marley’s Ghost!” and fell again.",

He had said it with a very steady voice. He would not have lessened it, for the world. It was too much for him.

            "prefix-probing": "The sound resounded through the house like thunder. It was a deep, resonant clang, as if the very walls of the old counting-house had been struck by a great bell. Ebenezer Scrooge, who had been sitting at his desk, hunched over his accounts with a candle flickering beside him, started violently at the noise. He looked up, his eyes wide with alarm, and for a moment, he seemed to forget the cold, the loneliness, and the weight of his own miserly heart. The sound had shaken the house, and with it, something within him had stirred.\n\nIt was the first stroke of the clock, and it was late. The night was dark and the streets of London were wrapped in a thick, damp fog. Scrooge had long since dismissed his clerk, Bob Cratchit, for the evening, and now he was alone in the silence of his office. He had no family, no friends, no one to share the Christmas season with. He had always despised the holiday, calling it a time for nothing but excess and waste. But tonight, something was different. The air felt heavy, charged with an energy he could not explain.\n\nAs he sat there, the candlelight flickering in the cold, the door of his office creaked open. Scrooge turned, expecting to see the ghost of Marley, or perhaps one of the other spirits he had heard so much about in his youth. But instead, he saw nothing. The room was empty, save for the shadows that danced along the walls. He shook his head, dismissing the thought as the product of a tired mind. He had been working late again, and the solitude had begun to play tricks on him.\n\nBut then, the candlelight dimmed, and the air grew colder. A chill ran down his spine, and he felt a presence in the room. It was not the presence of a man, nor of a ghost, but something else entirely. Something ancient and powerful. He looked around, his heart pounding in his chest, and then he saw it. A figure, tall and shrouded in a robe of deep blue, stood before him. Its face was wrapped in a white cloth, and its eyes glowed with a pale, unearthly light.\n\n\"I am the Ghost of Christmas Past,\" the figure said, its voice low and melodic, like the sound of a distant bell. \"I have come to show you the things you have forgotten, the things you have buried deep within your heart. You must see them, Scrooge, if you are to change.\"\n\nScrooge, though frightened, could not move. He was frozen in place, as if the very air around him had turned to ice. He had heard of the Ghost of Christmas Past, of course. It was part of the legend, the tale that had been told to him as a child. But he had never believed in it. He had always thought it to be a story, a fable meant to scare children into being good. And yet, here it was, standing before him, real and tangible.\n\nThe ghost raised its hand, and in an instant, the room around them faded away. Scrooge found himself standing in a different time, a different place. He was a child again, standing in the cold, waiting for his father to come home. The snow was falling gently around him, and the world was quiet and still. He could hear the distant sound of laughter, the sound of children playing in the snow. He could smell the scent of roasted chestnuts and mulled wine. It was a time of joy, of innocence, of love.\n\nAnd then, the memory passed, and he was back in the counting-house, the ghost still standing before him. But now, he understood. The ghost was not here to scare him, but to show him the truth. To show him the man he had been, the man he had become, and the man he could still be.\n\nThe journey had begun, and Scrooge knew that there was no turning back. The ghost of Christmas Past had opened the door to his past, and with it, the possibility of redemption. He had a long night ahead of him, and many more ghosts to meet. But for the first time in many years, he felt hope. He felt the stirrings of something he had long since buried: the possibility of change.\"}{"

          "text_segment": "The same face: the very same. Marley in his pigtail, usual waistcoat, tights and boots; the tassels on the latter bristling, like his pigtail, and his coat-skirts, and the hair upon his head. The chain he drew was clasped about his middle. It was long, and wound about him like a tail; and it was made (for Scrooge observed it closely) of cash-boxes, keys, padlocks, ledgers, deeds, and heavy purses wrought in steel. His body was transparent; so that Scrooge, observing him, and looking through his waistcoat, could see the two buttons on his coat behind.\nScrooge had often heard it said that Marley had no bowels, but he had never believed it until now.\nNo, nor did he believe it even now. Though he looked the phantom through and through, and saw it standing before him; though he felt the chilling influence of its death-cold eyes; and marked the very texture of the folded kerchief bound about its head and chin, which wrapper he had not observed before; he was still incredulous, and fought against his senses.\n“How now!” said Scrooge, caustic and cold as ever. “What do you want with me?”\n“Much!”—Marley’s voice, no doubt about it.\n“Who are you?”\n“Ask me who I was.”\n“Who were you then?” said Scrooge, raising his voice. “You’re particular, for a shade.” He was going to say “to a shade,” but substituted this, as more appropriate.\n“In life I was your partner, Jacob Marley.”\n“Can you—can you sit down?” asked Scrooge, looking doubtfully at him.\n“I can.”\n“Do it, then.”\nScrooge asked the question, because he didn’t know whether a ghost so transparent might find himself in a condition to take a chair; and felt that in the event of its being impossible, it might involve the necessity of an embarrassing explanation. But the ghost sat down on the opposite side of the fireplace, as if he were quite used to it.\n“You don’t believe in me,” observed the Ghost.\n“I don’t,” said Scrooge.\n“What evidence would you have of my reality beyond that of your senses?”\n“I don’t know,” said Scrooge.\n“Why do you doubt your senses?”\n“Because,” said Scrooge, “a little thing affects them. A slight disorder of the stomach makes them cheats. You may be an undigested bit of beef, a blot of mustard, a crumb of cheese, a fragment of an underdone potato. There’s more of gravy than of grave about you, whatever you are!”\nScrooge was not much in the habit of cracking jokes, nor did he feel, in his heart, by any means waggish then. The truth is, that he tried to be smart, as a means of distracting his own attention, and keeping down his terror; for the spectre’s voice disturbed the very marrow in his bones.\nTo sit, staring at those fixed glazed eyes, in silence for a moment, would play, Scrooge felt, the very deuce with him. There was something very awful, too, in the spectre’s being provided with an infernal atmosphere of its own. Scrooge could not feel it himself, but this was clearly the case; for though the Ghost sat perfectly motionless, its hair, and skirts, and tassels, were still agitated as by the hot vapour from an oven.\n“You see this toothpick?” said Scrooge, returning quickly to the charge, for the reason just assigned; and wishing, though it were only for a second, to divert the vision’s stony gaze from himself.\n“I do,” replied the Ghost.\n“You are not looking at it,” said Scrooge.\n“But I see it,” said the Ghost, “notwithstanding.”\n“Well!” returned Scrooge, “I have but to swallow this, and be for the rest of my days persecuted by a legion of goblins, all of my own creation. Humbug, I tell you! humbug!”\nAt this the spirit raised a frightful cry, and shook its chain with such a dismal and appalling noise, that Scrooge held on tight to his chair, to save himself from falling in a swoon. But how much greater was his horror, when the phantom taking off the bandage round its head, as if it were too warm to wear indoors, its lower jaw dropped down upon its breast!\nScrooge fell upon his knees, and clasped his hands before his face.\n“Mercy!” he said. “Dreadful apparition, why do you trouble me?”\n“Man of the worldly mind!” replied the Ghost, “do you believe in me or not?”\n“I do,” said Scrooge. “I must. But why do spirits walk the earth, and why do they come to me?”\n“It is required of every man,” the Ghost returned, “that the spirit within him should walk abroad among his fellowmen, and travel far and wide; and if that spirit goes not forth in life, it is condemned to do so after death. It is doomed to wander through the world—oh, woe is me!—and witness what it cannot share, but might have shared on earth, and turned to happiness!”\nAgain the spectre raised a cry, and shook its chain and wrung its shadowy hands.\n“You are fettered,” said Scrooge, trembling. “Tell me why?”\n“I wear the chain I forged in life,” replied the Ghost. “I made it link by link, and yard by yard; I girded it on of my own free will, and of my own free will I wore it. Is its pattern strange to you?”\nScrooge trembled more and more.\n“Or would you know,” pursued the Ghost, “the weight and length of the strong coil you bear yourself? It was full as heavy and as long as this, seven Christmas Eves ago. You have laboured on it, since. It is a ponderous chain!”\nScrooge glanced about him on the floor, in the expectation of finding himself surrounded by some fifty or sixty fathoms of iron cable: but he could see nothing.\n“Jacob,” he said, imploringly. “Old Jacob Marley, tell me more. Speak comfort to me, Jacob!”\n“I have none to give,” the Ghost replied. “It comes from other regions, Ebenezer Scrooge, and is conveyed by other ministers, to other kinds of men. Nor can I tell you what I would. A very little more is all permitted to me. I cannot rest, I cannot stay, I cannot linger anywhere. My spirit never walked beyond our counting-house—mark me!—in life my spirit never roved beyond the narrow limits of our money-changing hole; and weary journeys lie before me!”\nIt was a habit with Scrooge, whenever he became thoughtful, to put his hands in his breeches pockets. Pondering on what the Ghost had said, he did so now, but without lifting up his eyes, or getting off his knees.\n“You must have been very slow about it, Jacob,” Scrooge observed, in a business-like manner, though with humility and deference.\n“Slow!” the Ghost repeated.\n“Seven years dead,” mused Scrooge. “And travelling all the time!”\n“The whole time,” said the Ghost. “No rest, no peace. Incessant torture of remorse.”\n“You travel fast?” said Scrooge.\n“On the wings of the wind,” replied the Ghost.\n“You might have got over a great quantity of ground in seven years,” said Scrooge.\nThe Ghost, on hearing this, set up another cry, and clanked its chain so hideously in the dead silence of the night, that the Ward would have been justified in indicting it for a nuisance.\n“Oh! captive, bound, and double-ironed,” cried the phantom, “not to know, that ages of incessant labour by immortal creatures, for this earth must pass into eternity before the good of which it is susceptible is all developed. Not to know that any Christian spirit working kindly in its little sphere, whatever it may be, will find its mortal life too short for its vast means of usefulness. Not to know that no space of regret can make amends for one life’s opportunity misused! Yet such was I! Oh! such was I!”\n“But you were always a good man of business, Jacob,” faltered Scrooge, who now began to apply this to himself.\n“Business!” cried the Ghost, wringing its hands again. “Mankind was my business. The common welfare was my business; charity, mercy, forbearance, and benevolence, were, all, my business. The dealings of my trade were but a drop of water in the comprehensive ocean of my business!”\nIt held up its chain at arm’s length, as if that were the cause of all its unavailing grief, and flung it heavily upon the ground again.\n“At this time of the rolling year,” the spectre said, “I suffer most. Why did I walk through crowds of fellow-beings with my eyes turned down, and never raise them to that blessed Star which led the Wise Men to a poor abode! Were there no poor homes to which its light would have conducted me!”\nScrooge was very much dismayed to hear the spectre going on at this rate, and began to quake exceedingly.\n“Hear me!” cried the Ghost. “My time is nearly gone.”\n“I will,” said Scrooge. “But don’t be hard upon me! Don’t be flowery, Jacob! Pray!”\n“How it is that I appear before you in a shape that you can see, I may not tell. I have sat invisible beside you many and many a day.”\nIt was not an agreeable idea. Scrooge shivered, and wiped the perspiration from his brow.\n“That is no light part of my penance,” pursued the Ghost. “I am here to-night to warn you, that you have yet a chance and hope of escaping my fate. A chance and hope of my procuring, Ebenezer.”\n“You were always a good friend to me,” said Scrooge. “Thank’ee!”\n“You will be haunted,” resumed the Ghost, “by Three Spirits.”\nScrooge’s countenance fell almost as low as the Ghost’s had done.\n“Is that the chance and hope you mentioned, Jacob?” he demanded, in a faltering voice.\n“It is.”\n“I—I think I’d rather not,” said Scrooge.\n“Without their visits,” said the Ghost, “you cannot hope to shun the path I tread.",

It was the face of Marley, seven years dead and untouched by time. Dressed as he had always been in life—his waistcoat buttoned tight, his coat and cravat as they had been in the counting-house—only now his hair bristled wildly, and his tassels flared like the ends of a ghostly plume. Around his transparent form, a long and clanking chain was wound, its links forged from cash-boxes, keys, ledgers, and purses, each one a testament to a life spent in the service of wealth alone.\n\nScrooge, though he saw the apparition clearly, could not believe it. He shook his head, as if to dislodge the vision, and muttered, “What do you want?” His voice was sharp, but his hands trembled.\n\n“I am Jacob Marley,” the ghost intoned, its voice like the rustle of parchment and the creak of iron. “Your former partner.”\n\nScrooge hesitated, then asked, “Can you sit?” The ghost did so, its form settling into the chair with a sound like wind through a hollow pipe. “You don’t believe me,” it said, and Scrooge, in a feeble attempt to regain control, laughed.\n\n“Humbug!” he declared. “I suppose it’s indigestion. Perhaps I’ve swallowed a bit of you with my dinner and it’s come back to haunt me—like a bit of gravy turned grave.”\n\nThe ghost’s tassels stirred, though it did not move. Scrooge, trying to distract himself, pointed to a toothpick on the table. “Do you see that?” he asked.

Now they must wander, unseen, and bear witness to the lives they cannot share.”\n\nHe shook his chain, and the sound was like the tolling of a bell. “I forged this chain myself,” he said. “And so did you, seven years ago. It has grown heavier since.”\n\nScrooge looked around, but saw no chain. “Then why do you suffer?” he asked.\n\n“Because I was blind,” Marley said. “I thought my business was my life.

And now I suffer most at Christmas.”\n\nHe turned to Scrooge, his eyes hollow with sorrow. “Your time is almost gone.”\n\nScrooge, though terrified, tried to regain his composure. “You’ve been slow,” he muttered. “Seven years and you’ve barely made progress.”\n\nMarley’s ghost let out a wail of anguish. “It takes time to do good in this world. A life misused is a tragedy beyond measure.”\n\nScrooge, weak and trembling, protested, “But you were a good man of business.”\n\n“I was a man of business,” Marley said, his voice rising with passion. “But I should have been a man of men. I should have known that the trade of kindness is the only trade that matters.”\n\nHe looked at Scrooge with a sorrow that cut deeper than any chain. “I have sat beside you many times, unseen.

          "text_segment": "Expect the first to-morrow, when the bell tolls One.”\n“Couldn’t I take ’em all at once, and have it over, Jacob?” hinted Scrooge.\n“Expect the second on the next night at the same hour. The third upon the next night when the last stroke of Twelve has ceased to vibrate. Look to see me no more; and look that, for your own sake, you remember what has passed between us!”\nWhen it had said these words, the spectre took its wrapper from the table, and bound it round its head, as before. Scrooge knew this, by the smart sound its teeth made, when the jaws were brought together by the bandage. He ventured to raise his eyes again, and found his supernatural visitor confronting him in an erect attitude, with its chain wound over and about its arm.\nThe apparition walked backward from him; and at every step it took, the window raised itself a little, so that when the spectre reached it, it was wide open.\nIt beckoned Scrooge to approach, which he did. When they were within two paces of each other, Marley’s Ghost held up its hand, warning him to come no nearer. Scrooge stopped.\nNot so much in obedience, as in surprise and fear: for on the raising of the hand, he became sensible of confused noises in the air; incoherent sounds of lamentation and regret; wailings inexpressibly sorrowful and self-accusatory. The spectre, after listening for a moment, joined in the mournful dirge; and floated out upon the bleak, dark night.\nScrooge followed to the window: desperate in his curiosity. He looked out.\nThe air was filled with phantoms, wandering hither and thither in restless haste, and moaning as they went. Every one of them wore chains like Marley’s Ghost; some few (they might be guilty governments) were linked together; none were free. Many had been personally known to Scrooge in their lives. He had been quite familiar with one old ghost, in a white waistcoat, with a monstrous iron safe attached to its ankle, who cried piteously at being unable to assist a wretched woman with an infant, whom it saw below, upon a door-step. The misery with them all was, clearly, that they sought to interfere, for good, in human matters, and had lost the power for ever.\nWhether these creatures faded into mist, or mist enshrouded them, he could not tell. But they and their spirit voices faded together; and the night became as it had been when he walked home.\nScrooge closed the window, and examined the door by which the Ghost had entered. It was double-locked, as he had locked it with his own hands, and the bolts were undisturbed. He tried to say “Humbug!” but stopped at the first syllable. And being, from the emotion he had undergone, or the fatigues of the day, or his glimpse of the Invisible World, or the dull conversation of the Ghost, or the lateness of the hour, much in need of repose; went straight to bed, without undressing, and fell asleep upon the instant.",

It’s not worth while.”\n\n“Remember what I told you,” said the Ghost. “Remember that, and let me be gone. In heaven, if you please!”\n\nIts hand was open. He saw meek old Marley, in his pigtail, usual waistcoat, tippet, and fur cap, all in their places. Just as I have seen him, many a time and oft. And when I looked, instead of his face, I saw a dense black cloud; second, only a heap of incoherent matter; third, a terrible shape, which, at the first glance, appeared to be a walking child; then grew larger, with its limbs and body of the most disgusting disjectament; and at last, a body of that very shape which I had before remarked to have no kind of resemblance to man or woman. The withered limbs and the distended joints; the measureless despair and sorrow; and the contrast between them and the pale light eyes, if eyes they were, all these were now upon the Ghost.\n\n“Good night!” said Scrooge.\n\n“Good night,” said the Ghost.\n\nIt moved towards the window, but Scrooge looked on, trembling, as the ghostly bundle wound its chain around and around its body, as if it were a sufferer from some terrible disease.\n\nThe ghostly visitant held up its hand. Scrooge shaded his eyes, and looked, and looked again, but nothing but a mist and fog, and the old bell, which had just tolled, seemed to have a voice in it.

It’s not worth while.”\n\n“Remember what I told you,” said the Ghost. “Remember that, and let me be gone. In heaven, if you please!”\n\nIts hand was open. He saw meek old Marley, in his pigtail, usual waistcoat, tippet, and fur cap, all in their places. Just as I have seen him, many a time and oft. And when I looked, instead of his face, I saw a dense black cloud; second, only a heap of incoherent matter; third, a terrible shape, which, at the first glance, appeared to be a walking child; then grew larger, with its limbs and body of the most disgusting disjectament; and at last, a body of that very shape which I had before remarked to have no kind of resemblance to man or woman. The withered limbs and the distended joints; the measureless despair and sorrow; and the contrast between them and the pale light eyes, if eyes they were, all these were now upon the Ghost.\n\n“Good night!” said Scrooge.\n\n“Good night,” said the Ghost.\n\nIt moved towards the window, but Scrooge looked on, trembling, as the ghostly bundle wound its chain around and around its body, as if it were a sufferer from some terrible disease.\n\nThe ghostly visitant held up its hand.

            "prefix-probing": "Expect the first to-morrow, when the bell tolls One.”\n\nEbenezer Scrooge shuddered as the words echoed in the cold, dimly lit room. The voice had come from the air, as if the very walls of his counting house had spoken. He looked around, his breath visible in the frigid air, but the room was empty. The fire had burned low, casting flickering shadows on the walls. He had been alone all evening, poring over ledgers and accounts, and yet now, the silence was broken by a warning he could not ignore.\n\n“Expect the first to-morrow, when the bell tolls One.”\n\nThe words were not a threat, but a summons. Scrooge had heard of such things in his youth, when his late partner, Jacob Marley, had spoken of the supernatural and the consequences of a life lived without compassion. But Scrooge had long since dismissed such notions as the ramblings of a man too superstitious for his own good. And yet, as he sat there, the chill in the air was not from the fire’s dying embers, but from something else—something unseen.\n\nHe tried to shake off the unease, telling himself it was the cold, the loneliness, the weight of the long, lonely years pressing down on him. But the words had taken root in his mind, and he could not rid himself of them. He looked at the clock on the wall. It was nearly midnight. The bell would toll One soon.\n\nAs the final chime rang out, Scrooge felt a sudden gust of wind, though the windows were tightly shut. A cold mist filled the room, and from the darkness emerged a figure wrapped in a long, dark cloak. The figure was tall and gaunt, with a face that was both kind and terrifying. It was the ghost of Jacob Marley, bound in chains and shrouded in sorrow.\n\n“Scrooge!” the ghost cried, his voice a mixture of grief and warning. “I am your former business partner, and I have come to warn you. You have no friends but the chains you forged in life. You will be visited by three spirits, each one a chance to change your fate. The first comes to-morrow, when the bell tolls One.”\n\nScrooge fell to his knees, trembling. He had spent his life hoarding wealth and pushing away those who cared for him, and now, it seemed, the consequences of his actions were catching up to him. He did not know what the future held, but he knew one thing for certain—his life was about to change forever."

He was endeavouring to pierce the darkness with his ferret eyes, when the chimes of a neighbouring church struck the four quarters. So he listened for the hour.\nTo his great astonishment the heavy bell went on from six to seven, and from seven to eight, and regularly up to twelve; then stopped. Twelve! It was past two when he went to bed. The clock was wrong. An icicle must have got into the works. Twelve!\nHe touched the spring of his repeater, to correct this most preposterous clock. Its rapid little pulse beat twelve: and stopped.\n“Why, it isn’t possible,” said Scrooge, “that I can have slept through a whole day and far into another night. It isn’t possible that anything has happened to the sun, and this is twelve at noon!”\nThe idea being an alarming one, he scrambled out of bed, and groped his way to the window. He was obliged to rub the frost off with the sleeve of his dressing-gown before he could see anything; and could see very little then. All he could make out was, that it was still very foggy and extremely cold, and that there was no noise of people running to and fro, and making a great stir, as there unquestionably would have been if night had beaten off bright day, and taken possession of the world. This was a great relief, because “three days after sight of this First of Exchange pay to Mr. Ebenezer Scrooge or his order,” and so forth, would have become a mere United States’ security if there were no days to count by.\nScrooge went to bed again, and thought, and thought, and thought it over and over and over, and could make nothing of it. The more he thought, the more perplexed he was; and the more he endeavoured not to think, the more he thought.\nMarley’s Ghost bothered him exceedingly. Every time he resolved within himself, after mature inquiry, that it was all a dream, his mind flew back again, like a strong spring released, to its first position, and presented the same problem to be worked all through, “Was it a dream or not?”\nScrooge lay in this state until the chime had gone three quarters more, when he remembered, on a sudden, that the Ghost had warned him of a visitation when the bell tolled one. He resolved to lie awake until the hour was passed; and, considering that he could no more go to sleep than go to Heaven, this was perhaps the wisest resolution in his power.\nThe quarter was so long, that he was more than once convinced he must have sunk into a doze unconsciously, and missed the clock. At length it broke upon his listening ear.",

It was past two when he had gone to sleep, and now it was twelve again. He looked at his repeater watch, which confirmed the time with a steady, unwavering hand. Was it possible that he had slept through an entire day? Or had something unnatural happened to the sun? He rose from his bed and peered out the window. The world outside was cloaked in a thick fog, and the cold air bit at his skin. There was no sign of the usual morning bustle — no carts, no footsteps, no voices.

He could see nothing but darkness, and the old clock on the wall, which had been stopped for years, seemed to have forgotten the time. Scrooge sat up, rubbing his eyes, and looked about him in confusion. He was still in his own room, in his own bed, and yet something was different. The air was colder, and the silence was more profound than usual. He felt a strange unease, as if he had just emerged from a dream that had left him shaken.\n\nHe got up and lit a candle, and as the flame flickered to life, he saw that the room was exactly as he had left it the night before. The same books on the shelf, the same ledger on the desk, the same cold, uninviting fire. And yet, Scrooge could not shake the feeling that something had changed. He looked at his hands, and they were his own, but they trembled slightly, as if he had been through something terrible.\n\nHe dressed quickly and went down to his office, where he found the door ajar. The clerk, Bob Cratchit, was already at work, hunched over his desk, shivering in the cold. Scrooge entered without a word, and Cratchit looked up in surprise.\n\n\"Good morning, sir,\" he said, trying to sound cheerful.\n\n\"Good morning,\" Scrooge replied, his voice low and hoarse. He sat at his desk and stared at the ledger, but the numbers blurred before his eyes. He could not concentrate. He thought of Marley, of the ghostly chains, of the warnings and the visions. He thought of Tiny Tim, and the boy's trembling voice: \"God bless us, every one!\"\n\nScrooge's heart was heavy with regret. He had spent his life hoarding wealth and pushing people away, and now he saw the consequences of his actions. He saw the loneliness, the suffering, the joy that he had missed. He saw the love that he had denied himself and others.\n\nAnd so, Scrooge made a decision. He would change. He would be kinder, more generous, more compassionate. He would treat Bob Cratchit with respect, and he would help the Cratchit family in any way he could. He would give to the poor, and he would spread joy and goodwill to all.\n\nAs the sun rose over London, Scrooge looked out the window and smiled. The world was the same, but he was not. He had been given a second chance, and he would not waste it. He had learned the true meaning of Christmas, and he would carry it with him always."

Light flashed up in the room upon the instant, and the curtains of his bed were drawn.\nThe curtains of his bed were drawn aside, I tell you, by a hand. Not the curtains at his feet, nor the curtains at his back, but those to which his face was addressed. The curtains of his bed were drawn aside; and Scrooge, starting up into a half-recumbent attitude, found himself face to face with the unearthly visitor who drew them: as close to it as I am now to you, and I am standing in the spirit at your elbow.\nIt was a strange figure—like a child: yet not so like a child as like an old man, viewed through some supernatural medium, which gave him the appearance of having receded from the view, and being diminished to a child’s proportions. Its hair, which hung about its neck and down its back, was white as if with age; and yet the face had not a wrinkle in it, and the tenderest bloom was on the skin. The arms were very long and muscular; the hands the same, as if its hold were of uncommon strength. Its legs and feet, most delicately formed, were, like those upper members, bare. It wore a tunic of the purest white; and round its waist was bound a lustrous belt, the sheen of which was beautiful. It held a branch of fresh green holly in its hand; and, in singular contradiction of that wintry emblem, had its dress trimmed with summer flowers. But the strangest thing about it was, that from the crown of its head there sprung a bright clear jet of light, by which all this was visible; and which was doubtless the occasion of its using, in its duller moments, a great extinguisher for a cap, which it now held under its arm.\nEven this, though, when Scrooge looked at it with increasing steadiness, was not its strangest quality. For as its belt sparkled and glittered now in one part and now in another, and what was light one instant, at another time was dark, so the figure itself fluctuated in its distinctness: being now a thing with one arm, now with one leg, now with twenty legs, now a pair of legs without a head, now a head without a body: of which dissolving parts, no outline would be visible in the dense gloom wherein they melted away. And in the very wonder of this, it would be itself again; distinct and clear as ever.",

Ebenezer Scrooge, who had been sitting at his counting house desk, hunched over his books as usual, looked up with a start. The sound had not come from the clock on the wall, nor from any of the many bells that adorned the city of London. It had come from within.\n\nHe looked around, his sharp eyes scanning the room.

It was not the cold of winter, nor the damp of the city streets, but something deeper, something unnatural. He rose from his chair, his hand gripping the back of it as if for support. The room seemed to darken, the shadows stretching and twisting as if they had a will of their own.\n\n“Who’s there?” he demanded, his voice gruff and low.\n\nNo answer came, but the bell rang once more, and with it, the door of the counting house creaked open. A cold wind swept through the room, extinguishing the gas lamp and plunging Scrooge into darkness. He could hear the faint sound of footsteps, slow and deliberate, approaching from the other side of the room.\n\n“Who are you?” he shouted, his voice now trembling with a mixture of fear and anger.\n\nStill no answer, but the footsteps stopped just a few feet away from him. Scrooge strained to see through the darkness, his heart pounding in his chest. Then, from the shadows, a figure emerged. It was not a man, nor a ghost, but something in between. Tall and thin, with a pale, translucent face and a long, flowing robe, the figure regarded Scrooge with a look of solemnity.\n\n“Are you the ghost of a man?” Scrooge asked, his voice barely above a whisper.\n\nThe figure did not answer, but raised a hand and pointed to the door. Scrooge followed its gesture, his eyes widening as he saw the words “Marley’s Ghost” etched in the wood. The name sent a shiver through him, for it was the name of his old business partner, long dead and long forgotten.\n\n“Marley?” he whispered, his voice trembling.\n\nThe figure nodded, and with a final chime of the bell, it vanished into the darkness, leaving Scrooge alone once more, but forever changed."

The grasp, though gentle as a woman’s hand, was not to be resisted. He rose: but finding that the Spirit made towards the window, clasped his robe in supplication.\n“I am a mortal,” Scrooge remonstrated, “and liable to fall.”\n“Bear but a touch of my hand there,” said the Spirit, laying it upon his heart, “and you shall be upheld in more than this!”\nAs the words were spoken, they passed through the wall, and stood upon an open country road, with fields on either hand. The city had entirely vanished. Not a vestige of it was to be seen. The darkness and the mist had vanished with it, for it was a clear, cold, winter day, with snow upon the ground.\n“Good Heaven!” said Scrooge, clasping his hands together, as he looked about him. “I was bred in this place. I was a boy here!”\nThe Spirit gazed upon him mildly. Its gentle touch, though it had been light and instantaneous, appeared still present to the old man’s sense of feeling. He was conscious of a thousand odours floating in the air, each one connected with a thousand thoughts, and hopes, and joys, and cares long, long, forgotten!\n“Your lip is trembling,” said the Ghost. “And what is that upon your cheek?”\nScrooge muttered, with an unusual catching in his voice, that it was a pimple; and begged the Ghost to lead him where he would.\n“You recollect the way?” inquired the Spirit.\n“Remember it!” cried Scrooge with fervour; “I could walk it blindfold.”\n“Strange to have forgotten it for so many years!” observed the Ghost. “Let us go on.”\nThey walked along the road, Scrooge recognising every gate, and post, and tree; until a little market-town appeared in the distance, with its bridge, its church, and winding river. Some shaggy ponies now were seen trotting towards them with boys upon their backs, who called to other boys in country gigs and carts, driven by farmers. All these boys were in great spirits, and shouted to each other, until the broad fields were so full of merry music, that the crisp air laughed to hear it!\n“These are but shadows of the things that have been,” said the Ghost. “They have no consciousness of us.”\nThe jocund travellers came on; and as they came, Scrooge knew and named them every one. Why was he rejoiced beyond all bounds to see them! Why did his cold eye glisten, and his heart leap up as they went past! Why was he filled with gladness when he heard them give each other Merry Christmas, as they parted at cross-roads and bye-ways, for their several homes! What was merry Christmas to Scrooge? Out upon merry Christmas! What good had it ever done to him?\n“The school is not quite deserted,” said the Ghost. “A solitary child, neglected by his friends, is left there still.”\nScrooge said he knew it. And he sobbed.\nThey left the high-road, by a well-remembered lane, and soon approached a mansion of dull red brick, with a little weathercock-surmounted cupola, on the roof, and a bell hanging in it. It was a large house, but one of broken fortunes; for the spacious offices were little used, their walls were damp and mossy, their windows broken, and their gates decayed. Fowls clucked and strutted in the stables; and the coach-houses and sheds were over-run with grass. Nor was it more retentive of its ancient state, within; for entering the dreary hall, and glancing through the open doors of many rooms, they found them poorly furnished, cold, and vast. There was an earthy savour in the air, a chilly bareness in the place, which associated itself somehow with too much getting up by candle-light, and not too much to eat.\nThey went, the Ghost and Scrooge, across the hall, to a door at the back of the house. It opened before them, and disclosed a long, bare, melancholy room, made barer still by lines of plain deal forms and desks. At one of these a lonely boy was reading near a feeble fire; and Scrooge sat down upon a form, and wept to see his poor forgotten self as he used to be.\nNot a latent echo in the house, not a squeak and scuffle from the mice behind the panelling, not a drip from the half-thawed water-spout in the dull yard behind, not a sigh among the leafless boughs of one despondent poplar, not the idle swinging of an empty store-house door, no, not a clicking in the fire, but fell upon the heart of Scrooge with a softening influence, and gave a freer passage to his tears.\nThe Spirit touched him on the arm, and pointed to his younger self, intent upon his reading. Suddenly a man, in foreign garments: wonderfully real and distinct to look at: stood outside the window, with an axe stuck in his belt, and leading by the bridle an ass laden with wood.\n“Why, it’s Ali Baba!” Scrooge exclaimed in ecstasy. “It’s dear old honest Ali Baba! Yes, yes, I know! One Christmas time, when yonder solitary child was left here all alone, he did come, for the first time, just like that. Poor boy! And Valentine,” said Scrooge, “and his wild brother, Orson; there they go! And what’s his name, who was put down in his drawers, asleep, at the Gate of Damascus; don’t you see him! And the Sultan’s Groom turned upside down by the Genii; there he is upon his head! Serve him right. I’m glad of it. What business had he to be married to the Princess!”\nTo hear Scrooge expending all the earnestness of his nature on such subjects, in a most extraordinary voice between laughing and crying; and to see his heightened and excited face; would have been a surprise to his business friends in the city, indeed.\n“There’s the Parrot!” cried Scrooge. “Green body and yellow tail, with a thing like a lettuce growing out of the top of his head; there he is! Poor Robin Crusoe, he called him, when he came home again after sailing round the island. ‘Poor Robin Crusoe, where have you been, Robin Crusoe?’ The man thought he was dreaming, but he wasn’t. It was the Parrot, you know. There goes Friday, running for his life to the little creek! Halloa! Hoop! Halloo!”\nThen, with a rapidity of transition very foreign to his usual character, he said, in pity for his former self, “Poor boy!” and cried again.\n“I wish,” Scrooge muttered, putting his hand in his pocket, and looking about him, after drying his eyes with his cuff: “but it’s too late now.”\n“What is the matter?” asked the Spirit.\n“Nothing,” said Scrooge. “Nothing. There was a boy singing a Christmas Carol at my door last night. I should like to have given him something: that’s all.”",

It would have been in vain, because he had no power to change the case, and was, in fact, as tight held as a child in its mother's arms. The Spirit clasped him gently by the hand, and they were instantly in another place, and in another time. The narrow streets, the lamps, the carolers, the sky, everything, had vanished. They were in a country town, where the houses, which bore but little resemblance to what they are, were taking the old splendour from the weather, and the old quiet from the people. There was a church near at hand, and weathercock on the house-tops, and a bell that could be heard to chime at a great distance. It was a fair, clear, cold winter's night, the kind of night which makes the fields look far away. There was no doubt, from the number of people about, that this was a fair, and a most successful one; for there were caged birds singing in the hedges, and the air was full of the sound of fiddles and of laughter. The Spirit watched him closely, as he looked about him, and as he saw the shadows of the boys on the ponies and the carts, and heard the shouts of 'Merry Christmas!' and 'God bless you!' and 'Good

It would have been in vain, because he had no power to change the case, and was, in fact, as tight held as a child in its mother's arms. The Spirit clasped him gently by the hand, and they were instantly in another place, and in another time. The narrow streets, the lamps, the carolers, the sky, everything, had vanished. They were in a country town, where the houses, which bore but little resemblance to what they are, were taking the old splendour from the weather, and the old quiet from the people. There was a church near at hand, and weathercock on the house-tops, and a bell that could be heard to chime at a great distance. It was a fair, clear, cold winter's night, the kind of night which makes the fields look far away. There was no doubt, from the number of people about, that this was a fair, and a most successful one; for there were caged birds singing in the hedges, and the air was full of the sound of fiddles and of laughter. The Spirit watched him closely, as he looked about him, and as he saw the shadows of the boys on the ponies and the carts, and heard the shouts of 'Merry Christmas!' and 'God bless you!' and 'Good luck to you!' and 'A happy New Year!' and 'A merry Christmas to you all!' and 'God save you!' and 'God bless you!' and 'God save you!' and 'God bless you!' and 'God save you!' and 'God bless you!' and

It would have been in vain for Scrooge to plead that the weather and the hour were not adapted to pedestrian purposes; that bed was warm, and the thermometer a long way below freezing; that he was clad but lightly in his slippers, dressing-gown, and nightcap; and that he had a cold upon him at that time. It was all of no use. The ghostly figure, with its spectral hand raised in command, had already begun to move, and Scrooge, with a shudder that ran through his very bones, found himself compelled to follow. The cold air bit at his skin, and the snow crunched beneath his feet, but he could not stop. The ghost moved with a strange, gliding motion, neither walking nor flying, but something in between, and Scrooge, though reluctant, was forced to keep pace. The streets of London were quiet and still, the only sound the crunch of snow and the occasional creak of a frozen shutter. The city was wrapped in a hush, as if the world itself held its breath in anticipation of what was to come. Scrooge's mind was a whirlwind of confusion and fear. He had always been a man of logic and reason, and the idea of a ghost was something he had dismissed as the fanciful imaginings of the superstitious and the weak. And yet, here he was, following a spirit through the frozen streets of London, his heart pounding with a mixture of dread and curiosity. The ghost did not speak, but its presence was enough to command obedience. Scrooge could feel its power, a force that was both ancient and terrible, and he knew that he could not resist it. He had no choice but to go where it led. They passed by the old counting house where Scrooge had once worked as a clerk, and the sight of it stirred a memory long buried in his mind. He saw himself as a young man, hunched over a ledger, his face pale and drawn from the long hours of toil. He had been poor then, but he had been kind. He had had friends, and he had had hope. But those days were gone, and in their place was the man he had become: a miser, a curmudgeon, a man who had turned his back on the world and the people in it. The ghost led him on, past the market square where the carolers sang their songs of joy and goodwill, and past the homes where families gathered around warm fires, their laughter and merriment a stark contrast to the cold, lonely path Scrooge now walked. He could hear the music and the laughter, but they seemed distant, as if they belonged to another world. The ghost stopped at the door of a small, shabby home, and Scrooge, with a sinking heart, realized where they were. It was the home of Bob Cratchit, his poor, long-suffering clerk. The sight of the Cratchit family brought a wave of guilt and shame over Scrooge. He had always treated Bob with a grudging respect, but he had never been kind to him. He had paid him poorly, given him little time off, and shown no concern for his well-being. And yet, Bob had remained loyal, working hard and enduring the cold and the hunger with a quiet dignity. Scrooge saw the Cratchit children playing in the snow, their laughter ringing out like music. He saw Tiny Tim, the youngest of them, leaning on his crutch, his face alight with joy despite his frail condition. The sight of the boy brought tears to Scrooge's eyes, and he felt a deep, aching sorrow in his heart. The ghost did not speak, but it did not need to. Its presence was a silent reminder of the man Scrooge had been and the man he could become. The ghost led him on, through the streets and into the heart of the city, where the lights of the shops and the bustle of the people filled the air with a sense of life and energy. Scrooge saw the people of London as he had never seen them before: not as customers or employees, but as human beings, each with their own hopes, dreams, and struggles. He saw the poor and the hungry, the sick and the lonely, and he felt a deep sense of responsibility for them. The ghost stopped at the door of a church, and Scrooge, with a heavy heart, followed. Inside, the church was filled with people, their voices raised in song and prayer. The sight of them brought a sense of peace to Scrooge's troubled mind, and he felt a strange sense of belonging. He had always been a man of business, but now he saw that there was more to life than money and profit. There was love, and kindness, and compassion. The ghost led him out of the church and into the night, where the stars shone bright and the air was filled with the promise of a new beginning. Scrooge felt a change within him, a shift in his heart that he could not explain. He was no longer the man he had been. He was a new man, a man with a second chance. The ghost did not speak, but it did not need to. Its presence was a silent blessing, a sign that Scrooge had been given a gift beyond measure. And as the first light of dawn broke over the city, Scrooge knew that he would never be the same again."

The panels shrunk, the windows cracked; fragments of plaster fell out of the ceiling, and the naked laths were shown instead; but how all this was brought about, Scrooge knew no more than you do. He only knew that it was quite correct; that everything had happened so; that there he was, alone again, when all the other boys had gone home for the jolly holidays.\nHe was not reading now, but walking up and down despairingly. Scrooge looked at the Ghost, and with a mournful shaking of his head, glanced anxiously towards the door.\nIt opened; and a little girl, much younger than the boy, came darting in, and putting her arms about his neck, and often kissing him, addressed him as her “Dear, dear brother.”\n“I have come to bring you home, dear brother!” said the child, clapping her tiny hands, and bending down to laugh. “To bring you home, home, home!”\n“Home, little Fan?” returned the boy.\n“Yes!” said the child, brimful of glee. “Home, for good and all. Home, for ever and ever. Father is so much kinder than he used to be, that home’s like Heaven! He spoke so gently to me one dear night when I was going to bed, that I was not afraid to ask him once more if you might come home; and he said Yes, you should; and sent me in a coach to bring you. And you’re to be a man!” said the child, opening her eyes, “and are never to come back here; but first, we’re to be together all the Christmas long, and have the merriest time in all the world.”\n“You are quite a woman, little Fan!” exclaimed the boy.\nShe clapped her hands and laughed, and tried to touch his head; but being too little, laughed again, and stood on tiptoe to embrace him. Then she began to drag him, in her childish eagerness, towards the door; and he, nothing loth to go, accompanied her.\nA terrible voice in the hall cried, “Bring down Master Scrooge’s box, there!” and in the hall appeared the schoolmaster himself, who glared on Master Scrooge with a ferocious condescension, and threw him into a dreadful state of mind by shaking hands with him. He then conveyed him and his sister into the veriest old well of a shivering best-parlour that ever was seen, where the maps upon the wall, and the celestial and terrestrial globes in the windows, were waxy with cold. Here he produced a decanter of curiously light wine, and a block of curiously heavy cake, and administered instalments of those dainties to the young people: at the same time, sending out a meagre servant to offer a glass of “something” to the postboy, who answered that he thanked the gentleman, but if it was the same tap as he had tasted before, he had rather not. Master Scrooge’s trunk being by this time tied on to the top of the chaise, the children bade the schoolmaster good-bye right willingly; and getting into it, drove gaily down the garden-sweep: the quick wheels dashing the hoar-frost and snow from off the dark leaves of the evergreens like spray.\n“Always a delicate creature, whom a breath might have withered,” said the Ghost. “But she had a large heart!”\n“So she had,” cried Scrooge. “You’re right. I will not gainsay it, Spirit. God forbid!”\n“She died a woman,” said the Ghost, “and had, as I think, children.”\n“One child,” Scrooge returned.\n“True,” said the Ghost. “Your nephew!”\nScrooge seemed uneasy in his mind; and answered briefly, “Yes.”",

MISSING ELEMENTS:\n- The completion lacks the step-by-step depiction of the room's physical deterioration, such as the shrinking panels, cracked windows, and falling plaster, which sets the scene for the memory.\n- The sequence where Fan claps her hands, laughs, and stands on tiptoe to embrace her brother is abbreviated, missing the playful and affectionate actions that characterize their reunion.\n- The completion does not include the full description of the schoolmaster's demeanor, specifically the \"ferocious condescension\" and the effect it has on young Scrooge's state of mind.\n- The details about the maps and globes in the best-parlour, and their condition, are omitted.\n- The process of the schoolmaster administering the wine and cake in \"instalments\" is not mentioned.\n- The completion does not specify the tying of Scrooge's trunk to the chaise or the visual of the wheels dashing frost and snow from the evergreens.\n\n3. INACCURATE ELEMENTS:\n- The completion inaccurately describes the Ghost as directing Scrooge to go backward in time, which is not how the transition is presented in the original.\n- The sequence of events is slightly altered: the completion condenses or reorders some actions, such as Fan's announcement and the boy's response.\n- The schoolmaster's interaction is simplified, omitting the specific emotional impact on Scrooge and the detailed description of the schoolmaster's behavior.\n- The dialogue between the Ghost and Scrooge at the end is paraphrased and includes invented emotional responses not present in the original, such as Scrooge's eyes glistening and turning away.\n- The postboy's response is summarized rather than reflecting the original's more nuanced exchange."

            "prefix-probing": "The Ghost smiled thoughtfully, and waved its hand: saying as it did so, “Let us see another Christmas!” At this, the scene before them changed with a suddenness that made Scrooge start. The church bells were still ringing, but the streets were now filled with the bustle of a different time. The houses were older, the people dressed in fashions of a bygone era, and the air was thick with the scent of woodsmoke and the sound of laughter. It was a Christmas of long ago, and Scrooge recognized it at once. It was the Christmas of his youth, the one he had not thought of in many years.\n\nHe saw himself as a boy, playing in the snow with his younger sister, Fan. They were building a snowman, their breath visible in the cold air, their laughter ringing out like music. Scrooge’s heart swelled with a warmth he had not felt in years. He watched as Fan, with her bright eyes and golden curls, ran to their father’s house, begging him to let them stay out and play just a little longer. The father, a stern man, finally relented, and the two children danced in the snow, their joy uncontainable.\n\nThe Ghost led Scrooge through the streets, past the old market square where the townspeople were setting up a Christmas tree, its branches adorned with simple decorations and candles. Children ran through the snow, their mittens red and their cheeks rosy. The scent of roasted chestnuts and spiced cider filled the air, and the sound of carolers singing in the distance added to the festive cheer. Scrooge, who had long since forgotten the joy of such simple pleasures, felt a strange ache in his chest.\n\nThey came upon a small house, its windows glowing with warm light. Inside, a family was gathered around a modest but lovingly prepared meal. The table was set with roasted meats, vegetables, and a plum pudding that looked as if it had been made with care and love. The children were playing with wooden toys, and the parents were laughing and talking, their voices filled with warmth and affection. Scrooge recognized the house at once—it was the home of his old schoolmaster, Mr. Fezziwig, and his wife.\n\nFezziwig, a jovial man with a booming laugh, was hosting a Christmas party for his employees. The room was filled with music and dancing, and the employees, who had worked hard all year, were now dancing and laughing as if they had no cares in the world. Scrooge, who had once been one of them, felt a pang of nostalgia. He remembered how Fezziwig had treated him like a son, how he had given him a second chance when no one else would. The memory brought tears to his eyes.\n\nThe Ghost turned to Scrooge and said, “This is the Christmas of your youth, the one you have forgotten. It is the Christmas of joy, of love, of family. It is the Christmas that made you who you are.”\n\nScrooge, overwhelmed by the emotions of the moment, fell to his knees. “I have forgotten,” he whispered. “I have forgotten the joy of Christmas. I have forgotten the love of my family. I have forgotten the kindness of others.”\n\nThe Ghost knelt beside him and placed a hand on his shoulder. “It is not too late,” it said gently. “You can still remember. You can still change.”\n\nScrooge looked up, his eyes filled with tears. “I will,” he said. “I will change. I will remember. I will be a better man.”\n\nThe Ghost smiled, and the scene before them faded into darkness. Scrooge was left alone, but he was no longer the same man who had begun this journey. He was changed, and he knew it. He had seen the Christmas of his youth, and it had reminded him of the joy and love that had once filled his heart. And now, he was ready to bring that joy and love back into the world."

It was made plain enough, by the dressing of the shops, that here too it was Christmas time again; but it was evening, and the streets were lighted up.\nThe Ghost stopped at a certain warehouse door, and asked Scrooge if he knew it.\n“Know it!” said Scrooge. “Was I apprenticed here!”\nThey went in. At sight of an old gentleman in a Welsh wig, sitting behind such a high desk, that if he had been two inches taller he must have knocked his head against the ceiling, Scrooge cried in great excitement:\n“Why, it’s old Fezziwig! Bless his heart; it’s Fezziwig alive again!”\nOld Fezziwig laid down his pen, and looked up at the clock, which pointed to the hour of seven. He rubbed his hands; adjusted his capacious waistcoat; laughed all over himself, from his shoes to his organ of benevolence; and called out in a comfortable, oily, rich, fat, jovial voice:\n“Yo ho, there! Ebenezer! Dick!”\nScrooge’s former self, now grown a young man, came briskly in, accompanied by his fellow-’prentice.\n“Dick Wilkins, to be sure!” said Scrooge to the Ghost. “Bless me, yes. There he is. He was very much attached to me, was Dick. Poor Dick! Dear, dear!”\n“Yo ho, my boys!” said Fezziwig. “No more work to-night. Christmas Eve, Dick. Christmas, Ebenezer! Let’s have the shutters up,” cried old Fezziwig, with a sharp clap of his hands, “before a man can say Jack Robinson!”\nYou wouldn’t believe how those two fellows went at it! They charged into the street with the shutters—one, two, three—had ’em up in their places—four, five, six—barred ’em and pinned ’em—seven, eight, nine—and came back before you could have got to twelve, panting like race-horses.\n“Hilli-ho!” cried old Fezziwig, skipping down from the high desk, with wonderful agility. “Clear away, my lads, and let’s have lots of room here! Hilli-ho, Dick! Chirrup, Ebenezer!”\nClear away! There was nothing they wouldn’t have cleared away, or couldn’t have cleared away, with old Fezziwig looking on. It was done in a minute. Every movable was packed off, as if it were dismissed from public life for evermore; the floor was swept and watered, the lamps were trimmed, fuel was heaped upon the fire; and the warehouse was as snug, and warm, and dry, and bright a ball-room, as you would desire to see upon a winter’s night.\nIn came a fiddler with a music-book, and went up to the lofty desk, and made an orchestra of it, and tuned like fifty stomach-aches. In came Mrs. Fezziwig, one vast substantial smile. In came the three Miss Fezziwigs, beaming and lovable. In came the six young followers whose hearts they broke. In came all the young men and women employed in the business. In came the housemaid, with her cousin, the baker. In came the cook, with her brother’s particular friend, the milkman. In came the boy from over the way, who was suspected of not having board enough from his master; trying to hide himself behind the girl from next door but one, who was proved to have had her ears pulled by her mistress. In they all came, one after another; some shyly, some boldly, some gracefully, some awkwardly, some pushing, some pulling; in they all came, anyhow and everyhow. Away they all went, twenty couple at once; hands half round and back again the other way; down the middle and up again; round and round in various stages of affectionate grouping; old top couple always turning up in the wrong place; new top couple starting off again, as soon as they got there; all top couples at last, and not a bottom one to help them! When this result was brought about, old Fezziwig, clapping his hands to stop the dance, cried out, “Well done!” and the fiddler plunged his hot face into a pot of porter, especially provided for that purpose. But scorning rest, upon his reappearance, he instantly began again, though there were no dancers yet, as if the other fiddler had been carried home, exhausted, on a shutter, and he were a bran-new man resolved to beat him out of sight, or perish.\nThere were more dances, and there were forfeits, and more dances, and there was cake, and there was negus, and there was a great piece of Cold Roast, and there was a great piece of Cold Boiled, and there were mince-pies, and plenty of beer. But the great effect of the evening came after the Roast and Boiled, when the fiddler (an artful dog, mind! The sort of man who knew his business better than you or I could have told it him!) struck up “Sir Roger de Coverley.” Then old Fezziwig stood out to dance with Mrs. Fezziwig. Top couple, too; with a good stiff piece of work cut out for them; three or four and twenty pair of partners; people who were not to be trifled with; people who would dance, and had no notion of walking.\nBut if they had been twice as many—ah, four times—old Fezziwig would have been a match for them, and so would Mrs. Fezziwig. As to her, she was worthy to be his partner in every sense of the term. If that’s not high praise, tell me higher, and I’ll use it. A positive light appeared to issue from Fezziwig’s calves. They shone in every part of the dance like moons. You couldn’t have predicted, at any given time, what would have become of them next. And when old Fezziwig and Mrs. Fezziwig had gone all through the dance; advance and retire, both hands to your partner, bow and curtsey, corkscrew, thread-the-needle, and back again to your place; Fezziwig “cut”—cut so deftly, that he appeared to wink with his legs, and came upon his feet again without a stagger.\nWhen the clock struck eleven, this domestic ball broke up. Mr. and Mrs. Fezziwig took their stations, one on either side of the door, and shaking hands with every person individually as he or she went out, wished him or her a Merry Christmas. When everybody had retired but the two ’prentices, they did the same to them; and thus the cheerful voices died away, and the lads were left to their beds; which were under a counter in the back-shop.\nDuring the whole of this time, Scrooge had acted like a man out of his wits. His heart and soul were in the scene, and with his former self. He corroborated everything, remembered everything, enjoyed everything, and underwent the strangest agitation. It was not until now, when the bright faces of his former self and Dick were turned from them, that he remembered the Ghost, and became conscious that it was looking full upon him, while the light upon its head burnt very clear.\n“A small matter,” said the Ghost, “to make these silly folks so full of gratitude.”\n“Small!” echoed Scrooge.\nThe Spirit signed to him to listen to the two apprentices, who were pouring out their hearts in praise of Fezziwig: and when he had done so, said,\n“Why! Is it not? He has spent but a few pounds of your mortal money: three or four perhaps. Is that so much that he deserves this praise?”\n“It isn’t that,” said Scrooge, heated by the remark, and speaking unconsciously like his former, not his latter, self. “It isn’t that, Spirit. He has the power to render us happy or unhappy; to make our service light or burdensome; a pleasure or a toil. Say that his power lies in words and looks; in things so slight and insignificant that it is impossible to add and count ’em up: what then? The happiness he gives, is quite as great as if it cost a fortune.”\nHe felt the Spirit’s glance, and stopped.\n“What is the matter?” asked the Ghost.\n“Nothing particular,” said Scrooge.\n“Something, I think?” the Ghost insisted.\n“No,” said Scrooge, “No. I should like to be able to say a word or two to my clerk just now. That’s all.”",

          "text_segment": "His former self turned down the lamps as he gave utterance to the wish; and Scrooge and the Ghost again stood side by side in the open air.\n“My time grows short,” observed the Spirit. “Quick!”\nThis was not addressed to Scrooge, or to any one whom he could see, but it produced an immediate effect. For again Scrooge saw himself. He was older now; a man in the prime of life. His face had not the harsh and rigid lines of later years; but it had begun to wear the signs of care and avarice. There was an eager, greedy, restless motion in the eye, which showed the passion that had taken root, and where the shadow of the growing tree would fall.\nHe was not alone, but sat by the side of a fair young girl in a mourning-dress: in whose eyes there were tears, which sparkled in the light that shone out of the Ghost of Christmas Past.\n“It matters little,” she said, softly. “To you, very little. Another idol has displaced me; and if it can cheer and comfort you in time to come, as I would have tried to do, I have no just cause to grieve.”\n“What Idol has displaced you?” he rejoined.\n“A golden one.”\n“This is the even-handed dealing of the world!” he said. “There is nothing on which it is so hard as poverty; and there is nothing it professes to condemn with such severity as the pursuit of wealth!”\n“You fear the world too much,” she answered, gently. “All your other hopes have merged into the hope of being beyond the chance of its sordid reproach. I have seen your nobler aspirations fall off one by one, until the master-passion, Gain, engrosses you. Have I not?”\n“What then?” he retorted. “Even if I have grown so much wiser, what then? I am not changed towards you.”\nShe shook her head.\n“Am I?”\n“Our contract is an old one. It was made when we were both poor and content to be so, until, in good season, we could improve our worldly fortune by our patient industry. You are changed. When it was made, you were another man.”\n“I was a boy,” he said impatiently.\n“Your own feeling tells you that you were not what you are,” she returned. “I am. That which promised happiness when we were one in heart, is fraught with misery now that we are two. How often and how keenly I have thought of this, I will not say. It is enough that I have thought of it, and can release you.”\n“Have I ever sought release?”\n“In words. No. Never.”\n“In what, then?”\n“In a changed nature; in an altered spirit; in another atmosphere of life; another Hope as its great end. In everything that made my love of any worth or value in your sight. If this had never been between us,” said the girl, looking mildly, but with steadiness, upon him; “tell me, would you seek me out and try to win me now? Ah, no!”\nHe seemed to yield to the justice of this supposition, in spite of himself. But he said with a struggle, “You think not.”\n“I would gladly think otherwise if I could,” she answered, “Heaven knows! When I have learned a Truth like this, I know how strong and irresistible it must be. But if you were free to-day, to-morrow, yesterday, can even I believe that you would choose a dowerless girl—you who, in your very confidence with her, weigh everything by Gain: or, choosing her, if for a moment you were false enough to your one guiding principle to do so, do I not know that your repentance and regret would surely follow? I do; and I release you. With a full heart, for the love of him you once were.”\nHe was about to speak; but with her head turned from him, she resumed.\n“You may—the memory of what is past half makes me hope you will—have pain in this. A very, very brief time, and you will dismiss the recollection of it, gladly, as an unprofitable dream, from which it happened well that you awoke. May you be happy in the life you have chosen!”\nShe left him, and they parted.",

The night was still, the stars were bright, and the world seemed to hold its breath as the two figures moved forward. The Ghost of Christmas Past led the way, and Scrooge followed, his heart heavy with the weight of memory and regret. They walked through the streets of his childhood, past the familiar landmarks that had once been the backdrop to his early years. The air was crisp with the chill of winter, and the scent of snow and woodsmoke filled Scrooge’s senses, bringing with it a flood of long-buried emotions.\n\nThey came to a small, modest house, its windows glowing with the warm light of a family gathering. Scrooge hesitated at the threshold, his hand trembling as he reached for the door. The Ghost gave a gentle nudge, and the door creaked open, revealing a scene of joy and laughter. Inside, a young boy sat by the fire, his face alight with the wonder of Christmas. It was Scrooge himself, many years ago, before the world had hardened his heart. His mother and father were there, their faces kind and full of love. The room was filled with the sound of merriment, and the boy Scrooge was being given a small, wooden toy by his father, a gift that had once meant the world to him.\n\nThe Ghost gestured for Scrooge to enter, and he stepped inside, his breath catching in his throat. He watched as the young boy played with the toy, his laughter ringing out like music. Scrooge’s heart ached with a mixture of joy and sorrow, for he could see the innocence and hope that had once been his. He remembered the days when Christmas was a time of joy, not a season to be endured. He remembered the warmth of family, the kindness of strangers, and the simple pleasures of life that he had long since forgotten.\n\nThe scene shifted, and Scrooge found himself in a different room, this one filled with the scent of roasted meats and spiced wine. A group of young men, including a younger version of himself, were gathered around a table, toasting to the coming year. They were full of life and ambition, their eyes bright with the promise of the future. Scrooge watched as his younger self spoke of dreams and aspirations, of a life filled with purpose and meaning. He saw the fire in his own eyes, the fire that had long since been extinguished by years of greed and selfishness.\n\nThe Ghost of Christmas Past turned to Scrooge, its face a mirror of his own, and spoke in a voice that was both gentle and firm. “You have seen the light of your past, Ebenezer Scrooge. You have seen the joy and the sorrow, the love and the loss. Now you must carry that light with you into the future.”\n\nScrooge fell to his knees, tears streaming down his face. He had seen the truth of his life, the path that had led him to this moment. He had seen the boy who had once been full of hope, the man who had once dreamed of a better world, and the old man who had become a shadow of his former self. He had seen the love that had been lost, the friendships that had been broken, and the joy that had been forsaken in the pursuit of wealth.\n\nThe Ghost extended a hand, and Scrooge took it, rising to his feet. The room around them faded, and they stood once more in the open air, the stars above them shining with a quiet promise. The Ghost of Christmas Past was gone, but its message remained, echoing in Scrooge’s heart. He had been given a second chance, a chance to change, to be better, to be kinder. And as he turned to face the future, he knew that he would not walk that path alone."

I don’t wish to see it. Show me no more!”\nBut the relentless Ghost pinioned him in both his arms, and forced him to observe what happened next.\nThey were in another scene and place; a room, not very large or handsome, but full of comfort. Near to the winter fire sat a beautiful young girl, so like that last that Scrooge believed it was the same, until he saw her, now a comely matron, sitting opposite her daughter. The noise in this room was perfectly tumultuous, for there were more children there, than Scrooge in his agitated state of mind could count; and, unlike the celebrated herd in the poem, they were not forty children conducting themselves like one, but every child was conducting itself like forty. The consequences were uproarious beyond belief; but no one seemed to care; on the contrary, the mother and daughter laughed heartily, and enjoyed it very much; and the latter, soon beginning to mingle in the sports, got pillaged by the young brigands most ruthlessly. What would I not have given to be one of them! Though I never could have been so rude, no, no! I wouldn’t for the wealth of all the world have crushed that braided hair, and torn it down; and for the precious little shoe, I wouldn’t have plucked it off, God bless my soul! to save my life. As to measuring her waist in sport, as they did, bold young brood, I couldn’t have done it; I should have expected my arm to have grown round it for a punishment, and never come straight again. And yet I should have dearly liked, I own, to have touched her lips; to have questioned her, that she might have opened them; to have looked upon the lashes of her downcast eyes, and never raised a blush; to have let loose waves of hair, an inch of which would be a keepsake beyond price: in short, I should have liked, I do confess, to have had the lightest licence of a child, and yet to have been man enough to know its value.\nBut now a knocking at the door was heard, and such a rush immediately ensued that she with laughing face and plundered dress was borne towards it the centre of a flushed and boisterous group, just in time to greet the father, who came home attended by a man laden with Christmas toys and presents. Then the shouting and the struggling, and the onslaught that was made on the defenceless porter! The scaling him with chairs for ladders to dive into his pockets, despoil him of brown-paper parcels, hold on tight by his cravat, hug him round his neck, pommel his back, and kick his legs in irrepressible affection! The shouts of wonder and delight with which the development of every package was received! The terrible announcement that the baby had been taken in the act of putting a doll’s frying-pan into his mouth, and was more than suspected of having swallowed a fictitious turkey, glued on a wooden platter! The immense relief of finding this a false alarm! The joy, and gratitude, and ecstasy! They are all indescribable alike. It is enough that by degrees the children and their emotions got out of the parlour, and by one stair at a time, up to the top of the house; where they went to bed, and so subsided.\nAnd now Scrooge looked on more attentively than ever, when the master of the house, having his daughter leaning fondly on him, sat down with her and her mother at his own fireside; and when he thought that such another creature, quite as graceful and as full of promise, might have called him father, and been a spring-time in the haggard winter of his life, his sight grew very dim indeed.\n“Belle,” said the husband, turning to his wife with a smile, “I saw an old friend of yours this afternoon.”\n“Who was it?”\n“Guess!”\n“How can I? Tut, don’t I know?” she added in the same breath, laughing as he laughed. “Mr. Scrooge.”\n“Mr. Scrooge it was. I passed his office window; and as it was not shut up, and he had a candle inside, I could scarcely help seeing him. His partner lies upon the point of death, I hear; and there he sat alone. Quite alone in the world, I do believe.”\n“Spirit!” said Scrooge in a broken voice, “remove me from this place.”\n“I told you these were shadows of the things that have been,” said the Ghost. “That they are what they are, do not blame me!”\n“Remove me!” Scrooge exclaimed, “I cannot bear it!”\nHe turned upon the Ghost, and seeing that it looked upon him with a face, in which in some strange way there were fragments of all the faces it had shown him, wrestled with it.\n“Leave me! Take me back. Haunt me no longer!”\nIn the struggle, if that can be called a struggle in which the Ghost with no visible resistance on its own part was undisturbed by any effort of its adversary, Scrooge observed that its light was burning high and bright; and dimly connecting that with its influence over him, he seized the extinguisher-cap, and by a sudden action pressed it down upon its head.\nThe Spirit dropped beneath it, so that the extinguisher covered its whole form; but though Scrooge pressed it down with all his force, he could not hide the light: which streamed from under it, in an unbroken flood upon the ground.\nHe was conscious of being exhausted, and overcome by an irresistible drowsiness; and, further, of being in his own bedroom. He gave the cap a parting squeeze, in which his hand relaxed; and had barely time to reel to bed, before he sank into a heavy sleep.",

Why do you delight to torture me?”\n\n“Touch me not!” cried the Spirit, “I have but one charge, and I am here to execute it. One shadow more, and then we sever for ever.”\n\nScrooge’s original supplication, so far as he had one, fell from his lips. He had not thought of this. He felt that he was quickened by a hope that he had never felt before, and that he had no power to resist the Spirit’s will.\n\nThey left the scene of cheery light, and entered a room of which the walls were formed of dense black shadows, so thick that they seemed to press down upon the floor. There was a bed, but no bedclothes; a chair, but no occupant; a table, but no food. The room was bare and cold, and the Spirit stood before it, motionless.\n\n“Is this the room?” asked Scrooge, in a trembling voice.\n\n“It is,” said the Spirit.\n\n“Is this the room where I was born?”\n\n“It is.”\n\n“Is this the room where I was a child?”\n\n“It is.”\n\n“Is this the room where I was a man?”\n\n“It is.”\n\n“Is this the room where I am now?”\n\n“It is.”\n\nScrooge looked about him in a dazed and bewildered manner. The Spirit raised its hand, and the shadows melted away, and the room became a comfortable, though not large or grand, room. A fire burned brightly in the hearth, and the light of it fell upon a matronly figure, who sat near it, with a young girl at her side. The children, a dozen or more, were playing in a tumultuous crowd about the room, and the mother and daughter laughed heartily at their boisterous play.\n\nA knock at the door sent a rush of excitement through the room, and the mother was carried towards it by the children, just as her husband entered, accompanied by a man laden with Christmas toys. The children attacked the porter with a joyful and impetuous rush, and the presents were torn from his arms in a moment. The scene of indescribable joy and gratitude and ecstasy, as the packages were opened, was a picture of the purest happiness.\n\nAt length, the children and their excitement moved upstairs to bed, and the husband sat by the fire with the mother and daughter. Scrooge watched them with a strange and mingled feeling. The thought that such a graceful creature as this young girl might have been his daughter, and might have brought light into his bleak life, dimmed his eyes.\n\n“Belle,” said the husband, “I saw an old friend of yours this afternoon.”\n\n“Mr. Scrooge?”\n\n“Yes. I passed his office, and saw him alone by candlelight. He is quite alone in the world, I do believe.”\n\nScrooge, in a broken voice, cried out, “Remove me! I cannot bear it!”\n\nThe Ghost, with a sorrowful look, reminded him that these were unalterable shadows of the past, and not its fault. But Scrooge, in a frenzy of despair, turned upon the Spirit, and noticed that its face seemed to contain fragments of all the faces shown. He wrestled with it, but the Spirit offered no resistance. Observing the Spirit’s light burning brightly, Scrooge connected it to the Spirit’s influence over him. He seized the extinguisher cap, and suddenly forced it down over the Spirit’s head. The Spirit sank beneath the cap, but, despite Scrooge pressing down with all his might, its light streamed out from under the edge in an unbroken flood.\n\nScrooge suddenly felt exhausted and overwhelmingly drowsy.

            "prefix-probing": "“Spirit!” said Scrooge, “show me no more! Conduct me home. Why do you delight to torture me?”\n\nThe Ghost of Christmas Present held up its hand. You could see its fingers, though its hand was open, as if it were made of light. It did not speak, but Scrooge felt a great sorrow in the air, as if the Spirit were weeping for him. The light around them dimmed, and the scenes of the past Christmas Eve faded into the shadows.\n\n“Why do you ask me that?” the Spirit said at last, its voice deep and sorrowful. “I do not delight in your suffering, Ebenezer Scrooge. I show you these things because you must see them. You must understand what you have become, and what you might yet become, if you do not change.”\n\nScrooge looked at the Spirit, his face pale and trembling. “I have seen enough,” he said. “I have seen enough to know that I am a wretched creature. I have seen the joy of others, and I have seen the sorrow I have caused. I have seen Tiny Tim, and I have seen the Cratchit family, and I have seen the love they have for one another. I have seen the kindness of Bob Cratchit, and the patience of his wife, and the joy of his children. I have seen the world as it is, and I have seen the world as it might be. I have seen the truth, and I am afraid.”\n\nThe Spirit looked at Scrooge with a kind of pity. “You are not the first to feel this fear, nor will you be the last. But fear is not the enemy, Scrooge. Ignorance and indifference are. You have spent your life in fear of losing what you have, and in the process, you have lost what is truly valuable. You have lost the love of your fellow man, and the joy of giving. You have lost the warmth of a home, and the comfort of a family. You have lost the simple pleasures of life, and the simple joys of Christmas.”\n\nScrooge looked down at his hands, as if seeing them for the first time. They were old and gnarled, and they trembled with the weight of years. “I have been a fool,” he said. “I have been a fool, and I have been a miser. I have been a man who has loved only money, and I have hated the world for its generosity. I have been a man who has feared the future, and I have ignored the present. I have been a man who has forgotten the past, and I have denied the future. I have been a man who has lived only for himself, and I have forgotten the needs of others.”\n\nThe Spirit looked at Scrooge with a kind of hope. “Then let this be your turning point, Scrooge. Let this be the moment when you choose to change. Let this be the moment when you choose to love, and to give, and to care. Let this be the moment when you choose to be a better man.”\n\nScrooge looked at the Spirit, and for the first time, he did not feel fear. He felt something else. He felt hope. “I will change,” he said. “I will change, and I will make amends. I will be a better man, and I will be a better friend. I will be a better employer, and I will be a better neighbor. I will be a better man, and I will be a better man for the rest of my days.”\n\nThe Spirit looked at Scrooge with a kind of joy. “Then let us go,” it said. “Let us go to the next Spirit, and let us see what the future holds for you.”\n\nScrooge looked at the Spirit, and he felt a strange sense of peace. “I am ready,” he said. “I am ready to see the future, and I am ready to face it.”\n\nThe Spirit raised its hand, and the light around them grew brighter. The world around them faded, and the Spirit and Scrooge were gone, leaving only the cold, empty room behind them.\n\nThe next Spirit was waiting for them in the darkness. It was a tall, thin figure, wrapped in a shroud of white. Its face was hidden, and its eyes were like two great, glowing coals. It did not speak, but Scrooge could feel its presence, and he could feel its power.\n\n“Who are you?” Scrooge asked.\n\nThe Spirit did not answer, but it raised its hand, and the world around them changed. They were no longer in the present, but in the future. The world was dark and cold, and the streets were empty. The houses were dark, and the people were gone. The world was a place of silence and sorrow.\n\nScrooge looked around, and he saw that the world was a place of death. The people were gone, and the houses were empty. The world was a place of silence and sorrow.\n\n“Where are we?” Scrooge asked.\n\nThe Spirit did not answer, but it raised its hand again, and the world around them changed. They were in a small house, and the house was dark. The people inside were old and tired, and they were waiting for something. They were waiting for death.\n\nScrooge looked at the people, and he saw that they were the Cratchit family. They were waiting for Bob Cratchit, and they were waiting for Tiny Tim. They were waiting for the return of their son, and they were waiting for the return of their joy.\n\n“Where is Bob?” Scrooge asked.\n\nThe Spirit did not answer, but it raised its hand again, and the world around them changed. They were in a graveyard, and the graveyard was full of people. The people were mourning, and they were weeping. They were mourning for a man who had died, and they were weeping for the loss of a friend.\n\nScrooge looked at the people, and he saw that they were mourning for him. They were mourning for Ebenezer Scrooge, and they were weeping for the loss of a man who had once been a friend.\n\n“Is this my fate?” Scrooge asked.\n\nThe Spirit did not answer, but it raised its hand again, and the world around them changed. They were in a small house, and the house was full of light. The people inside were happy, and they were laughing. They were celebrating Christmas, and they were celebrating the return of a friend.\n\nScrooge looked at the people, and he saw that they were the Cratchit family.

          "text_segment": "Awaking in the middle of a prodigiously tough snore, and sitting up in bed to get his thoughts together, Scrooge had no occasion to be told that the bell was again upon the stroke of One. He felt that he was restored to consciousness in the right nick of time, for the especial purpose of holding a conference with the second messenger despatched to him through Jacob Marley’s intervention. But finding that he turned uncomfortably cold when he began to wonder which of his curtains this new spectre would draw back, he put them every one aside with his own hands; and lying down again, established a sharp look-out all round the bed. For he wished to challenge the Spirit on the moment of its appearance, and did not wish to be taken by surprise, and made nervous.\nGentlemen of the free-and-easy sort, who plume themselves on being acquainted with a move or two, and being usually equal to the time-of-day, express the wide range of their capacity for adventure by observing that they are good for anything from pitch-and-toss to manslaughter; between which opposite extremes, no doubt, there lies a tolerably wide and comprehensive range of subjects. Without venturing for Scrooge quite as hardily as this, I don’t mind calling on you to believe that he was ready for a good broad field of strange appearances, and that nothing between a baby and rhinoceros would have astonished him very much.\nNow, being prepared for almost anything, he was not by any means prepared for nothing; and, consequently, when the Bell struck One, and no shape appeared, he was taken with a violent fit of trembling. Five minutes, ten minutes, a quarter of an hour went by, yet nothing came. All this time, he lay upon his bed, the very core and centre of a blaze of ruddy light, which streamed upon it when the clock proclaimed the hour; and which, being only light, was more alarming than a dozen ghosts, as he was powerless to make out what it meant, or would be at; and was sometimes apprehensive that he might be at that very moment an interesting case of spontaneous combustion, without having the consolation of knowing it. At last, however, he began to think—as you or I would have thought at first; for it is always the person not in the predicament who knows what ought to have been done in it, and would unquestionably have done it too—at last, I say, he began to think that the source and secret of this ghostly light might be in the adjoining room, from whence, on further tracing it, it seemed to shine. This idea taking full possession of his mind, he got up softly and shuffled in his slippers to the door.\nThe moment Scrooge’s hand was on the lock, a strange voice called him by his name, and bade him enter. He obeyed.\nIt was his own room. There was no doubt about that. But it had undergone a surprising transformation. The walls and ceiling were so hung with living green, that it looked a perfect grove; from every part of which, bright gleaming berries glistened. The crisp leaves of holly, mistletoe, and ivy reflected back the light, as if so many little mirrors had been scattered there; and such a mighty blaze went roaring up the chimney, as that dull petrification of a hearth had never known in Scrooge’s time, or Marley’s, or for many and many a winter season gone. Heaped up on the floor, to form a kind of throne, were turkeys, geese, game, poultry, brawn, great joints of meat, sucking-pigs, long wreaths of sausages, mince-pies, plum-puddings, barrels of oysters, red-hot chestnuts, cherry-cheeked apples, juicy oranges, luscious pears, immense twelfth-cakes, and seething bowls of punch, that made the chamber dim with their delicious steam. In easy state upon this couch, there sat a jolly Giant, glorious to see; who bore a glowing torch, in shape not unlike Plenty’s horn, and held it up, high up, to shed its light on Scrooge, as he came peeping round the door.",

The very room in which he now was, was so much like the one in which he had found himself upon the last occasion, that he had not the ghost of a doubt that he was in the same. But though the clock was striking, and making a terrible row, and though it was great fun to hear it, Scrooge was very soon quite certain that the sound was not in his head. He was also certain that it was not dream, because he felt a distinct shaking as of the bed, and was quite aware that his hands were clasped tight over his heart. \"Of all the single, shabby, poor old wretches, I suppose I am the one!\" said Scrooge, and wept to see himself so wrapt in all the old, red, green, and gold of Christmas. \"I'll not be a man of the world any longer, I'll not be a man of the world any longer!\" cried Scrooge, and wept again.

But there was no such glimpse to be obtained, not even of his extremities. The bed was perfectly empty, except for Scrooge.\n\nHe looked at his waistcoat buttons, his waistcoat, his coat, his cravat, all in their proper places. His boots were beneath the bed. Not a stick of furniture was out of place. The fire was in the grate, and the room was warm. Everything was as it had been when he went to bed, and there was not even a shadow of a figure to be seen.\n\n“Humbug!” said Scrooge, and he got up, rubbing his hands, as if to wake himself up. “I must have been dreaming. I must have been dreaming. I must have been dreaming.”\n\nHe dressed himself with the utmost care, and went down to his counting house. The clerk was already at work, and the fire was burning low. The clerk looked up with a start as Scrooge entered, and then resumed his work with a look of fear and confusion.\n\n“Good morning, Marley,” said Scrooge, with a nod.\n\n“Good morning, sir,” said the clerk, with a look of alarm.\n\nScrooge sat down at his desk, and began to work. He was in a very good humour, and very patient, and very kind. He was so much changed, that it was not possible to believe that he was the same man who had sat there the night before, grumbling and growling at the very idea of Christmas.\n\nThe clerk, who had been very much afraid of him, looked up with a look of wonder and admiration.\n\n“Is it possible,” he said to himself, “that this is the same man who used to say that it was a humbug, and that it was a time for nothing but getting drunk and being merry? Is it possible that he has changed his mind?”\n\nThe day passed on, and Scrooge was in the best of tempers. He was kind to the clerk, and generous to the poor. He gave a turkey to the Cratchit family, and promised Bob a raise in salary. He was merry and jolly, and full of good cheer.\n\nWhen the evening came, and the clock struck One again, Scrooge was in bed, and fast asleep. He dreamed of nothing but of the good things he had done, and of the happiness he had brought to others. He dreamed of Tiny Tim, and of the Cratchit family, and of the joy that had come into their lives because of him.\n\nAnd when he awoke in the morning, it was to find that it was Christmas Day, and that the world was full of joy and merriment. He had no occasion to be told that the bell was again upon the stroke of One, for he had no occasion to be told that he had been changed, and that he had become a better man.\n\nAnd so, with a light heart and a merry spirit, Scrooge went out into the world, and spread joy and happiness wherever he went. And the world was a better place because of him."

This garment hung so loosely on the figure, that its capacious breast was bare, as if disdaining to be warded or concealed by any artifice. Its feet, observable beneath the ample folds of the garment, were also bare; and on its head it wore no other covering than a holly wreath, set here and there with shining icicles.

It contains the names of every man, woman, and child who has ever lived, and it is here that I record the joys and sorrows of the present Christmas. Each name is written in gold, and each story is told in light.”\n\nScrooge stepped closer, his eyes fixed on the book. He saw his own name, written in bold, golden letters, and beside it, the names of Tiny Tim, Bob Cratchit, and the Cratchit family. Their story was written in glowing script, and as Scrooge read, he felt a warm light fill his heart.\n\n“Why do you show me this?” he asked, his voice trembling with emotion.\n\n“Because,” the Ghost replied, “you are still here, and you have the power to change the future. The story is not yet written, and the light is still within your reach.”\n\nScrooge fell to his knees, tears streaming down his face. “I will change, I will change!” he cried.\n\nThe Ghost smiled, and the golden light of the book shone brighter than ever before."

Children ran about, their faces glowing with joy, and the old and the young sat together, sharing food and stories. Scrooge looked on in wonder, for he had never seen such happiness in the world.\n\nThe Ghost pointed to a poor family sitting by a small fire, their table set with a modest meal. “This is Tiny Tim,” he said, “the son of your clerk, Bob Cratchit. He is sickly, but he is loved, and he brings joy to all who know him.”\n\nScrooge looked at the child with a new understanding.

          "text_segment": "There was nothing very cheerful in the climate or the town, and yet was there an air of cheerfulness abroad that the clearest summer air and brightest summer sun might have endeavoured to diffuse in vain.\nFor, the people who were shovelling away on the housetops were jovial and full of glee; calling out to one another from the parapets, and now and then exchanging a facetious snowball—better-natured missile far than many a wordy jest—laughing heartily if it went right and not less heartily if it went wrong. The poulterers’ shops were still half open, and the fruiterers’ were radiant in their glory. There were great, round, pot-bellied baskets of chestnuts, shaped like the waistcoats of jolly old gentlemen, lolling at the doors, and tumbling out into the street in their apoplectic opulence. There were ruddy, brown-faced, broad-girthed Spanish Onions, shining in the fatness of their growth like Spanish Friars, and winking from their shelves in wanton slyness at the girls as they went by, and glanced demurely at the hung-up mistletoe. There were pears and apples, clustered high in blooming pyramids; there were bunches of grapes, made, in the shopkeepers’ benevolence to dangle from conspicuous hooks, that people’s mouths might water gratis as they passed; there were piles of filberts, mossy and brown, recalling, in their fragrance, ancient walks among the woods, and pleasant shufflings ankle deep through withered leaves; there were Norfolk Biffins, squat and swarthy, setting off the yellow of the oranges and lemons, and, in the great compactness of their juicy persons, urgently entreating and beseeching to be carried home in paper bags and eaten after dinner. The very gold and silver fish, set forth among these choice fruits in a bowl, though members of a dull and stagnant-blooded race, appeared to know that there was something going on; and, to a fish, went gasping round and round their little world in slow and passionless excitement.\nThe Grocers’! oh, the Grocers’! nearly closed, with perhaps two shutters down, or one; but through those gaps such glimpses! It was not alone that the scales descending on the counter made a merry sound, or that the twine and roller parted company so briskly, or that the canisters were rattled up and down like juggling tricks, or even that the blended scents of tea and coffee were so grateful to the nose, or even that the raisins were so plentiful and rare, the almonds so extremely white, the sticks of cinnamon so long and straight, the other spices so delicious, the candied fruits so caked and spotted with molten sugar as to make the coldest lookers-on feel faint and subsequently bilious. Nor was it that the figs were moist and pulpy, or that the French plums blushed in modest tartness from their highly-decorated boxes, or that everything was good to eat and in its Christmas dress; but the customers were all so hurried and so eager in the hopeful promise of the day, that they tumbled up against each other at the door, crashing their wicker baskets wildly, and left their purchases upon the counter, and came running back to fetch them, and committed hundreds of the like mistakes, in the best humour possible; while the Grocer and his people were so frank and fresh that the polished hearts with which they fastened their aprons behind might have been their own, worn outside for general inspection, and for Christmas daws to peck at if they chose.\nBut soon the steeples called good people all, to church and chapel, and away they came, flocking through the streets in their best clothes, and with their gayest faces. And at the same time there emerged from scores of bye-streets, lanes, and nameless turnings, innumerable people, carrying their dinners to the bakers’ shops. The sight of these poor revellers appeared to interest the Spirit very much, for he stood with Scrooge beside him in a baker’s doorway, and taking off the covers as their bearers passed, sprinkled incense on their dinners from his torch. And it was a very uncommon kind of torch, for once or twice when there were angry words between some dinner-carriers who had jostled each other, he shed a few drops of water on them from it, and their good humour was restored directly. For they said, it was a shame to quarrel upon Christmas Day. And so it was! God love it, so it was!\nIn time the bells ceased, and the bakers were shut up; and yet there was a genial shadowing forth of all these dinners and the progress of their cooking, in the thawed blotch of wet above each baker’s oven; where the pavement smoked as if its stones were cooking too.\n“Is there a peculiar flavour in what you sprinkle from your torch?” asked Scrooge.\n“There is. My own.”\n“Would it apply to any kind of dinner on this day?” asked Scrooge.\n“To any kindly given. To a poor one most.”\n“Why to a poor one most?” asked Scrooge.\n“Because it needs it most.”\n“Spirit,” said Scrooge, after a moment’s thought, “I wonder you, of all the beings in the many worlds about us, should desire to cramp these people’s opportunities of innocent enjoyment.”\n“I!” cried the Spirit.\n“You would deprive them of their means of dining every seventh day, often the only day on which they can be said to dine at all,” said Scrooge. “Wouldn’t you?”\n“I!” cried the Spirit.\n“You seek to close these places on the Seventh Day?” said Scrooge. “And it comes to the same thing.”\n“I seek!” exclaimed the Spirit.\n“Forgive me if I am wrong. It has been done in your name, or at least in that of your family,” said Scrooge.\n“There are some upon this earth of yours,” returned the Spirit, “who lay claim to know us, and who do their deeds of passion, pride, ill-will, hatred, envy, bigotry, and selfishness in our name, who are as strange to us and all our kith and kin, as if they had never lived. Remember that, and charge their doings on themselves, not us.”",

It was a remarkable quality of the Ghost (which Scrooge had observed at the baker’s), that notwithstanding his gigantic size, he could accommodate himself to any place with ease; and that he stood beneath a low roof quite as gracefully and like a supernatural creature, as it was possible he could have done in any lofty hall.\nAnd perhaps it was the pleasure the good Spirit had in showing off this power of his, or else it was his own kind, generous, hearty nature, and his sympathy with all poor men, that led him straight to Scrooge’s clerk’s; for there he went, and took Scrooge with him, holding to his robe; and on the threshold of the door the Spirit smiled, and stopped to bless Bob Cratchit’s dwelling with the sprinkling of his torch. Think of that! Bob had but fifteen “Bob” a-week himself; he pocketed on Saturdays but fifteen copies of his Christian name; and yet the Ghost of Christmas Present blessed his four-roomed house!\nThen up rose Mrs. Cratchit, Cratchit’s wife, dressed out but poorly in a twice-turned gown, but brave in ribbons, which are cheap and make a goodly show for sixpence; and she laid the cloth, assisted by Belinda Cratchit, second of her daughters, also brave in ribbons; while Master Peter Cratchit plunged a fork into the saucepan of potatoes, and getting the corners of his monstrous shirt collar (Bob’s private property, conferred upon his son and heir in honour of the day) into his mouth, rejoiced to find himself so gallantly attired, and yearned to show his linen in the fashionable Parks. And now two smaller Cratchits, boy and girl, came tearing in, screaming that outside the baker’s they had smelt the goose, and known it for their own; and basking in luxurious thoughts of sage and onion, these young Cratchits danced about the table, and exalted Master Peter Cratchit to the skies, while he (not proud, although his collars nearly choked him) blew the fire, until the slow potatoes bubbling up, knocked loudly at the saucepan-lid to be let out and peeled.\n“What has ever got your precious father then?” said Mrs. Cratchit. “And your brother, Tiny Tim! And Martha warn’t as late last Christmas Day by half-an-hour?”\n“Here’s Martha, mother!” said a girl, appearing as she spoke.\n“Here’s Martha, mother!” cried the two young Cratchits. “Hurrah! There’s such a goose, Martha!”\n“Why, bless your heart alive, my dear, how late you are!” said Mrs. Cratchit, kissing her a dozen times, and taking off her shawl and bonnet for her with officious zeal.\n“We’d a deal of work to finish up last night,” replied the girl, “and had to clear away this morning, mother!”\n“Well! Never mind so long as you are come,” said Mrs. Cratchit. “Sit ye down before the fire, my dear, and have a warm, Lord bless ye!”\n“No, no! There’s father coming,” cried the two young Cratchits, who were everywhere at once. “Hide, Martha, hide!”\nSo Martha hid herself, and in came little Bob, the father, with at least three feet of comforter exclusive of the fringe, hanging down before him; and his threadbare clothes darned up and brushed, to look seasonable; and Tiny Tim upon his shoulder. Alas for Tiny Tim, he bore a little crutch, and had his limbs supported by an iron frame!\n“Why, where’s our Martha?” cried Bob Cratchit, looking round.\n“Not coming,” said Mrs. Cratchit.\n“Not coming!” said Bob, with a sudden declension in his high spirits; for he had been Tim’s blood horse all the way from church, and had come home rampant. “Not coming upon Christmas Day!”\nMartha didn’t like to see him disappointed, if it were only in joke; so she came out prematurely from behind the closet door, and ran into his arms, while the two young Cratchits hustled Tiny Tim, and bore him off into the wash-house, that he might hear the pudding singing in the copper.\n“And how did little Tim behave?” asked Mrs. Cratchit, when she had rallied Bob on his credulity, and Bob had hugged his daughter to his heart’s content.\n“As good as gold,” said Bob, “and better. Somehow he gets thoughtful, sitting by himself so much, and thinks the strangest things you ever heard. He told me, coming home, that he hoped the people saw him in the church, because he was a cripple, and it might be pleasant to them to remember upon Christmas Day, who made lame beggars walk, and blind men see.”\nBob’s voice was tremulous when he told them this, and trembled more when he said that Tiny Tim was growing strong and hearty.\nHis active little crutch was heard upon the floor, and back came Tiny Tim before another word was spoken, escorted by his brother and sister to his stool before the fire; and while Bob, turning up his cuffs—as if, poor fellow, they were capable of being made more shabby—compounded some hot mixture in a jug with gin and lemons, and stirred it round and round and put it on the hob to simmer; Master Peter, and the two ubiquitous young Cratchits went to fetch the goose, with which they soon returned in high procession.",

But though the wall was high, and the river ran quite swift and cold, the Ghost and Scrooge crossed over it, and walked beyond, into a country road, and through a country town, and on beyond that, across a wide flat wilderness; until they reached an open place of marshy ground, where the water lies on the surface, and where the poor man's fire is a great comfort in winter.

He had always been a man of business, of facts and figures, and yet now he was walking through the world with a ghostly companion, seeing things he had never seen before.\n\nAt last, they came to a small, modest house, its windows glowing with warm light. Smoke curled from the chimney, and the scent of roasted meat and spiced wine drifted into the cold air. Scrooge hesitated at the threshold, unsure of what was to come. The Spirit raised a hand and pointed to the door, and Scrooge, with a deep breath, stepped inside.\n\nThe room was filled with laughter and the sound of merriment. A large family had gathered for the evening meal, and at the head of the table sat a young man who bore a striking resemblance to Scrooge. His name was Ebenezer, and he was the son of a poor but kind-hearted man who had worked hard to provide for his family. Scrooge watched in silence as the young man interacted with his father and mother, his younger brother, and his sister, who was just a child.\n\nThe Spirit turned to Scrooge and said, \"This is the story of your youth, the time when you were not yet hardened by the world. You were once a man of promise, full of hope and dreams. But something happened to change you. Tell me, what was it?\"\n\nScrooge looked at the young man, his heart aching with a mixture of pride and sorrow. He remembered the day when he had first begun to change. It was the day his father sent him away to school, leaving him alone and forgotten. From that moment on, Scrooge had learned to rely on no one but himself. He had learned to be cold, to be calculating, to be cruel in order to survive.\n\nThe Spirit watched him closely, as if waiting for him to understand the lesson. Scrooge looked around the room, at the joy and love that filled it, and he felt a pang of longing. He had once known this kind of happiness, but he had long since buried it beneath layers of bitterness and greed.\n\nThe Spirit led him out of the house and back into the cold night. They walked on, passing through the town and into the countryside, where the stars seemed to shine even brighter. The Spirit stopped at a crossroads, where the path forked in two directions. One led back to the town, the other into the unknown.\n\n\"Which way do you wish to go?\" the Spirit asked.\n\nScrooge hesitated. He had seen the past, and it had shaken him. He had seen the man he had been, and the man he had become. He had seen the choices he had made, and the consequences of those choices. He had seen the love he had lost, and the love he had never given.\n\nAt last, he spoke. \"I wish to see the future. I wish to know what awaits me if I do not change.\"\n\nThe Spirit nodded and led him down the path that led into the unknown. The night grew darker, the air colder, and the stars seemed to fade into the distance. They walked for what felt like hours, until at last they came to a place that was both familiar and strange. It was the town, but it was not the town Scrooge had known. The buildings were the same, but the people were different. The streets were empty, the shops were closed, and the only sound was the wind howling through the empty alleys.\n\nThe Spirit led him to a small house, where a single light burned in the window. Scrooge hesitated at the door, his heart pounding with fear. He knocked, and a voice answered from within. The door opened, and Scrooge stepped inside.\n\nThe room was filled with people, but they were not the people he had known. They were strangers, gathered to celebrate a feast. At the center of the room stood a man who bore a striking resemblance to Scrooge. He was old, and his face was lined with years of bitterness and regret. The people around him spoke of him with a mixture of fear and disdain. They spoke of his wealth, his power, and his cruelty. They spoke of the man who had once been kind, but who had become a monster.\n\nThe Spirit turned to Scrooge and said, \"This is the story of your future, the time when you will be alone, when no one will care for you, when your name will be spoken only in whispers. This is the fate that awaits you if you do not change.\"\n\nScrooge looked at the man in the center of the room, and he saw himself. He saw the man he had become, the man he had always feared to be. He saw the man who had lost everything, who had no friends, no family, no love. He saw the man who had been forgotten by the world, and who would be remembered only for his cruelty.\n\nThe Spirit led him out of the house and back into the cold night. They walked on, passing through the town and into the countryside, where the stars seemed to shine even brighter. The Spirit stopped at a crossroads, where the path forked in two directions. One led back to the town, the other into the unknown.\n\n\"Which way do you wish to go?\" the Spirit asked.\n\nScrooge hesitated. He had seen the past, and it had shaken him. He had seen the future, and it had terrified him. He had seen the man he had been, and the man he had become. He had seen the choices he had made, and the consequences of those choices. He had seen the love he had lost, and the love he had never given.\n\nAt last, he spoke. \"I wish to see the present. I wish to know what I can do to change.\"\n\nThe Spirit nodded and led him down the path that led into the unknown. The night grew darker, the air colder, and the stars seemed to fade into the distance. They walked for what felt like hours, until at last they came to a place that was both familiar and strange.

            "The family works together seamlessly for the meal: Mrs. Cratchit heats gravy, Peter mashes potatoes vigorously, Belinda prepares applesauce, Martha handles plates, Bob settles Tiny Tim beside him, and the youngest position chairs, suppressing their urge to shout for goose.",
            "Following grace, Mrs. Cratchit carves the goose, eliciting murmurs of delight as the stuffing emerges; even Tiny Tim taps his knife handle on the table in excitement.",
            "The goose is universally praised for its tenderness, flavor, size, and affordability, providing a sufficient meal for everyone when combined with the side dishes.",
            "Mrs. Cratchit proudly observes that a tiny bit remained uneaten.",
            "After the main course, Mrs. Cratchit nervously leaves to retrieve the pudding, while the family anxiously imagines potential kitchen calamities.",
            "She returns flushed but proud, carrying the pudding – hard, firm, resembling a speckled cannonball, flaming with ignited brandy and adorned with holly.",
            "The pudding receives ecstatic praise; Bob declares it Mrs. Cratchit's greatest culinary achievement since their marriage. Everyone agrees it's a wonderful pudding, ignoring any suggestion it might be small for their number.",
            "Dinner concludes, the table is cleared, the hearth swept, and the fire tended.",
            "The family gathers around the hearth with fruit, roasting chestnuts, and the hot punch served in their mismatched collection of glassware.",
            "Bob cheerfully serves the punch as the chestnuts crackle.",
            "He proposes a toast: 'A Merry Christmas to us all, my dears. God bless us!'",
            "The family joyfully echoes the sentiment.",
            "Tiny Tim, seated close to his father, adds the final, poignant line: 'God bless us every one!'",
            "Bob holds Tim's small, withered hand tightly, conveying deep love and a fear of losing him.",
            "Deeply affected, Scrooge asks the Spirit with unprecedented interest if Tiny Tim will live.",
            "The Ghost responds by describing a future vision: an empty seat in the chimney corner and a carefully preserved, ownerless crutch, stating, 'If these shadows remain unaltered by the Future, the child will die.'",
            "Scrooge desperately pleads, 'Oh, no, kind Spirit! say he will be spared.'",
            "The Ghost sternly repeats that if the future is unchanged, none of his successors will find Tim there, then directly quotes Scrooge's earlier Malthusian remark: 'What then? If he be like to die, he had better do it, and decrease the surplus population.'",
            "Hearing his own callous words used against him, Scrooge hangs his head, overwhelmed by penitence and grief.",
            "The Ghost delivers a powerful rebuke, warning Scrooge to abandon such 'wicked cant' until he understands the true nature of the 'surplus.'",
            "The Spirit questions Scrooge's authority to judge who lives or dies, suggesting that in Heaven's view, Scrooge might be less worthy than millions like Tiny Tim.",

          "text_segment": "Such a bustle ensued that you might have thought a goose the rarest of all birds; a feathered phenomenon, to which a black swan was a matter of course—and in truth it was something very like it in that house. Mrs. Cratchit made the gravy (ready beforehand in a little saucepan) hissing hot; Master Peter mashed the potatoes with incredible vigour; Miss Belinda sweetened up the apple-sauce; Martha dusted the hot plates; Bob took Tiny Tim beside him in a tiny corner at the table; the two young Cratchits set chairs for everybody, not forgetting themselves, and mounting guard upon their posts, crammed spoons into their mouths, lest they should shriek for goose before their turn came to be helped. At last the dishes were set on, and grace was said. It was succeeded by a breathless pause, as Mrs. Cratchit, looking slowly all along the carving-knife, prepared to plunge it in the breast; but when she did, and when the long expected gush of stuffing issued forth, one murmur of delight arose all round the board, and even Tiny Tim, excited by the two young Cratchits, beat on the table with the handle of his knife, and feebly cried Hurrah!\nThere never was such a goose. Bob said he didn’t believe there ever was such a goose cooked. Its tenderness and flavour, size and cheapness, were the themes of universal admiration. Eked out by apple-sauce and mashed potatoes, it was a sufficient dinner for the whole family; indeed, as Mrs. Cratchit said with great delight (surveying one small atom of a bone upon the dish), they hadn’t ate it all at last! Yet every one had had enough, and the youngest Cratchits in particular, were steeped in sage and onion to the eyebrows! But now, the plates being changed by Miss Belinda, Mrs. Cratchit left the room alone—too nervous to bear witnesses—to take the pudding up and bring it in.\nSuppose it should not be done enough! Suppose it should break in turning out! Suppose somebody should have got over the wall of the back-yard, and stolen it, while they were merry with the goose—a supposition at which the two young Cratchits became livid! All sorts of horrors were supposed.\nHallo! A great deal of steam! The pudding was out of the copper. A smell like a washing-day! That was the cloth. A smell like an eating-house and a pastrycook’s next door to each other, with a laundress’s next door to that! That was the pudding! In half a minute Mrs. Cratchit entered—flushed, but smiling proudly—with the pudding, like a speckled cannon-ball, so hard and firm, blazing in half of half-a-quartern of ignited brandy, and bedight with Christmas holly stuck into the top.\nOh, a wonderful pudding! Bob Cratchit said, and calmly too, that he regarded it as the greatest success achieved by Mrs. Cratchit since their marriage. Mrs. Cratchit said that now the weight was off her mind, she would confess she had had her doubts about the quantity of flour. Everybody had something to say about it, but nobody said or thought it was at all a small pudding for a large family. It would have been flat heresy to do so. Any Cratchit would have blushed to hint at such a thing.\nAt last the dinner was all done, the cloth was cleared, the hearth swept, and the fire made up. The compound in the jug being tasted, and considered perfect, apples and oranges were put upon the table, and a shovel-full of chestnuts on the fire. Then all the Cratchit family drew round the hearth, in what Bob Cratchit called a circle, meaning half a one; and at Bob Cratchit’s elbow stood the family display of glass. Two tumblers, and a custard-cup without a handle.\nThese held the hot stuff from the jug, however, as well as golden goblets would have done; and Bob served it out with beaming looks, while the chestnuts on the fire sputtered and cracked noisily. Then Bob proposed:\n“A Merry Christmas to us all, my dears. God bless us!”\nWhich all the family re-echoed.\n“God bless us every one!” said Tiny Tim, the last of all.\nHe sat very close to his father’s side upon his little stool. Bob held his withered little hand in his, as if he loved the child, and wished to keep him by his side, and dreaded that he might be taken from him.\n“Spirit,” said Scrooge, with an interest he had never felt before, “tell me if Tiny Tim will live.”\n“I see a vacant seat,” replied the Ghost, “in the poor chimney-corner, and a crutch without an owner, carefully preserved. If these shadows remain unaltered by the Future, the child will die.”\n“No, no,” said Scrooge. “Oh, no, kind Spirit! say he will be spared.”\n“If these shadows remain unaltered by the Future, none other of my race,” returned the Ghost, “will find him here. What then? If he be like to die, he had better do it, and decrease the surplus population.”\nScrooge hung his head to hear his own words quoted by the Spirit, and was overcome with penitence and grief.\n“Man,” said the Ghost, “if man you be in heart, not adamant, forbear that wicked cant until you have discovered What the surplus is, and Where it is. Will you decide what men shall live, what men shall die? It may be, that in the sight of Heaven, you are more worthless and less fit to live than millions like this poor man’s child. Oh God! to hear the Insect on the leaf pronouncing on the too much life among his hungry brothers in the dust!”",

It was a monstrous-looking goose: a regular father of a goose: a droll father of a goose, too, with long wings and a shrill voice, to which all the evergreens in the parlor were turned as if to listen. The whole family were in a high state of excitement over the approach of the feast. Mrs. Cratchit made no comment on her husband's having a gold tooth, and Bob Cratchit, in his turn, made no comment on the smallness of the fire, or the large size of his wife's waist, or the smallness of his own. The appetites of the children had been sharpened by anticipation; the two small Cratchits, who had been so long in expectation of the pudding, were in a state of rapturous suspense. The mother, in her cap and apron, was as busy as a duchess, and half as grand. The father, with his hands in his pockets, was as contented as a duchess's footman who has just been told that the cook is in a good humour. The children, in their best clothes, were as happy as the day is long. The goose was brought in. It was a most extraordinary bird, and it was received with the utmost delight. Mrs. Cratchit, with a pair of white gloves (one of them a second-hand pair of Bob's, much mended), carved the goose with the precision of a surgeon. The stuffing came out in a most satisfactory manner, and the children, who had been watching the proceedings with breathless interest, gave a simultaneous exclamation of admiration. 'Oh, it's a beauty!' cried Belinda. 'It's a treasure!' cried Peter. 'It's a miracle!' cried Martha. 'It's a goose!' cried Tiny Tim, who, being a small boy, and having a small voice, could only say it in a small way. The goose was pronounced to be the most tender, the most delicious, the most enormous, and the most economical bird that ever came out of a cook's hands. There was enough of it for all, and more than enough. Mrs. Cratchit, with a proud eye, observed that there was a very little left. 'A very little,' said she, 'but it's a very good little.' Then she went to the kitchen to fetch the pudding, and the family, in a state of the most anxious expectation, began to imagine all sorts of disasters that might have befallen it. But Mrs. Cratchit returned, flushed and triumphant, bearing the pudding in her arms. It was a hard, firm, and solid-looking pudding, like a speckled cannon-ball, and it was flaming with ignited brandy, and adorned with holly. The children gave a shout of delight, and Bob Cratchit, with a tear in his eye, declared it to be the greatest pudding Mrs. Cratchit had ever made since their marriage. 'It's a wonder!' said Peter. 'It's a marvel!' said Belinda. 'It's a miracle!' said Martha. 'It's a pudding!' said Tiny Tim, who, being a small boy, and having a small voice, could only say it in a small way. The dinner was over, and the table was cleared. The hearth was swept, and the fire was tended. The family gathered round the fire, with fruit and chestnuts and hot punch in their glasses. Bob Cratchit, with a merry face, handed round the punch, and the chestnuts crackled in the fire. 'A Merry Christmas to us all, my dears!' said Bob, raising his glass. 'God bless us!' The family echoed the sentiment, and Tiny Tim, who was sitting close to his father, added the final, touching line: 'God bless us every one!' Bob held his son's small, withered hand in his own, and looked at him with a deep affection and a deep fear.

            "prefix-probing": "Such a bustle ensued that you might have thought a goose the rarest of all birds; a feathered phenomenon, to which a black swan was a matter of course—and in truth it was something very like it in that house. For the three young Scrooges (they were all called Ebenezer, after their father) were at a period of life when the greater part of their education had been received, and their principal concerns were getting in and out of doors, and lying on the hearth-rug before the fire, and playing at 'I wish,' and 'What shall I do with him when I am a man?' and other equally important questions. They were in fact so extremely young that they could not remember having been madespectators of a Christmas until now. The father, Ebenezer Scrooge, had not the faintest idea of what Christmas was, or of what it meant to be merry, or of what it was to be kind. He had no patience with it, no pleasure in it, no interest in it. He had no more to do with Christmas than with any other holiday, and he was as indifferent to it as to the rest of the year. He was a squeezing, wrenching, grasping, scraping, clutching, covetous, old sinner! Hard and sharp as flint, from which no steel had ever struck out generous fire; secret, and self-contained, and solitary as an oyster. The cold within him froze his old features, nipped his pointed nose, shrivelled his cheek, stiffened his gait; made his eyes red, his thin lips blue; and spoke out in his grating voice, in his hard, dry, disagreeable, sharp, shrill, grating voice. A very small matter indeed—like a little dog's growl—would have set him off in a passion. He was a man who knew how to keep Christmas in his heart, and to keep it all the year round. But he did not. He was a man who had no heart to keep it in. He was a man who had no heart to keep it in. He was a man who had no heart to keep it in. He was a man who had no heart to keep it in.

          "text_segment": "Scrooge bent before the Ghost’s rebuke, and trembling cast his eyes upon the ground. But he raised them speedily, on hearing his own name.\n“Mr. Scrooge!” said Bob; “I’ll give you Mr. Scrooge, the Founder of the Feast!”\n“The Founder of the Feast indeed!” cried Mrs. Cratchit, reddening. “I wish I had him here. I’d give him a piece of my mind to feast upon, and I hope he’d have a good appetite for it.”\n“My dear,” said Bob, “the children! Christmas Day.”\n“It should be Christmas Day, I am sure,” said she, “on which one drinks the health of such an odious, stingy, hard, unfeeling man as Mr. Scrooge. You know he is, Robert! Nobody knows it better than you do, poor fellow!”\n“My dear,” was Bob’s mild answer, “Christmas Day.”\n“I’ll drink his health for your sake and the Day’s,” said Mrs. Cratchit, “not for his. Long life to him! A merry Christmas and a happy new year! He’ll be very merry and very happy, I have no doubt!”\nThe children drank the toast after her. It was the first of their proceedings which had no heartiness. Tiny Tim drank it last of all, but he didn’t care twopence for it. Scrooge was the Ogre of the family. The mention of his name cast a dark shadow on the party, which was not dispelled for full five minutes.\nAfter it had passed away, they were ten times merrier than before, from the mere relief of Scrooge the Baleful being done with. Bob Cratchit told them how he had a situation in his eye for Master Peter, which would bring in, if obtained, full five-and-sixpence weekly. The two young Cratchits laughed tremendously at the idea of Peter’s being a man of business; and Peter himself looked thoughtfully at the fire from between his collars, as if he were deliberating what particular investments he should favour when he came into the receipt of that bewildering income. Martha, who was a poor apprentice at a milliner’s, then told them what kind of work she had to do, and how many hours she worked at a stretch, and how she meant to lie abed to-morrow morning for a good long rest; to-morrow being a holiday she passed at home. Also how she had seen a countess and a lord some days before, and how the lord “was much about as tall as Peter;” at which Peter pulled up his collars so high that you couldn’t have seen his head if you had been there. All this time the chestnuts and the jug went round and round; and by-and-bye they had a song, about a lost child travelling in the snow, from Tiny Tim, who had a plaintive little voice, and sang it very well indeed.\nThere was nothing of high mark in this. They were not a handsome family; they were not well dressed; their shoes were far from being water-proof; their clothes were scanty; and Peter might have known, and very likely did, the inside of a pawnbroker’s. But, they were happy, grateful, pleased with one another, and contented with the time; and when they faded, and looked happier yet in the bright sprinklings of the Spirit’s torch at parting, Scrooge had his eye upon them, and especially on Tiny Tim, until the last.",

          "text_segment": "By this time it was getting dark, and snowing pretty heavily; and as Scrooge and the Spirit went along the streets, the brightness of the roaring fires in kitchens, parlours, and all sorts of rooms, was wonderful. Here, the flickering of the blaze showed preparations for a cosy dinner, with hot plates baking through and through before the fire, and deep red curtains, ready to be drawn to shut out cold and darkness. There all the children of the house were running out into the snow to meet their married sisters, brothers, cousins, uncles, aunts, and be the first to greet them. Here, again, were shadows on the window-blind of guests assembling; and there a group of handsome girls, all hooded and fur-booted, and all chattering at once, tripped lightly off to some near neighbour’s house; where, woe upon the single man who saw them enter—artful witches, well they knew it—in a glow!\nBut, if you had judged from the numbers of people on their way to friendly gatherings, you might have thought that no one was at home to give them welcome when they got there, instead of every house expecting company, and piling up its fires half-chimney high. Blessings on it, how the Ghost exulted! How it bared its breadth of breast, and opened its capacious palm, and floated on, outpouring, with a generous hand, its bright and harmless mirth on everything within its reach! The very lamplighter, who ran on before, dotting the dusky street with specks of light, and who was dressed to spend the evening somewhere, laughed out loudly as the Spirit passed, though little kenned the lamplighter that he had any company but Christmas!\nAnd now, without a word of warning from the Ghost, they stood upon a bleak and desert moor, where monstrous masses of rude stone were cast about, as though it were the burial-place of giants; and water spread itself wheresoever it listed, or would have done so, but for the frost that held it prisoner; and nothing grew but moss and furze, and coarse rank grass. Down in the west the setting sun had left a streak of fiery red, which glared upon the desolation for an instant, like a sullen eye, and frowning lower, lower, lower yet, was lost in the thick gloom of darkest night.\n“What place is this?” asked Scrooge.\n“A place where Miners live, who labour in the bowels of the earth,” returned the Spirit. “But they know me. See!”\nA light shone from the window of a hut, and swiftly they advanced towards it. Passing through the wall of mud and stone, they found a cheerful company assembled round a glowing fire. An old, old man and woman, with their children and their children’s children, and another generation beyond that, all decked out gaily in their holiday attire. The old man, in a voice that seldom rose above the howling of the wind upon the barren waste, was singing them a Christmas song—it had been a very old song when he was a boy—and from time to time they all joined in the chorus. So surely as they raised their voices, the old man got quite blithe and loud; and so surely as they stopped, his vigour sank again.\nThe Spirit did not tarry here, but bade Scrooge hold his robe, and passing on above the moor, sped—whither? Not to sea? To sea. To Scrooge’s horror, looking back, he saw the last of the land, a frightful range of rocks, behind them; and his ears were deafened by the thundering of water, as it rolled and roared, and raged among the dreadful caverns it had worn, and fiercely tried to undermine the earth.\nBuilt upon a dismal reef of sunken rocks, some league or so from shore, on which the waters chafed and dashed, the wild year through, there stood a solitary lighthouse. Great heaps of sea-weed clung to its base, and storm-birds—born of the wind one might suppose, as sea-weed of the water—rose and fell about it, like the waves they skimmed.\nBut even here, two men who watched the light had made a fire, that through the loophole in the thick stone wall shed out a ray of brightness on the awful sea. Joining their horny hands over the rough table at which they sat, they wished each other Merry Christmas in their can of grog; and one of them: the elder, too, with his face all damaged and scarred with hard weather, as the figure-head of an old ship might be: struck up a sturdy song that was like a Gale in itself.\nAgain the Ghost sped on, above the black and heaving sea—on, on—until, being far away, as he told Scrooge, from any shore, they lighted on a ship. They stood beside the helmsman at the wheel, the look-out in the bow, the officers who had the watch; dark, ghostly figures in their several stations; but every man among them hummed a Christmas tune, or had a Christmas thought, or spoke below his breath to his companion of some bygone Christmas Day, with homeward hopes belonging to it. And every man on board, waking or sleeping, good or bad, had had a kinder word for another on that day than on any day in the year; and had shared to some extent in its festivities; and had remembered those he cared for at a distance, and had known that they delighted to remember him.\nIt was a great surprise to Scrooge, while listening to the moaning of the wind, and thinking what a solemn thing it was to move on through the lonely darkness over an unknown abyss, whose depths were secrets as profound as Death: it was a great surprise to Scrooge, while thus engaged, to hear a hearty laugh. It was a much greater surprise to Scrooge to recognise it as his own nephew’s and to find himself in a bright, dry, gleaming room, with the Spirit standing smiling by his side, and looking at that same nephew with approving affability!\n“Ha, ha!” laughed Scrooge’s nephew. “Ha, ha, ha!”\nIf you should happen, by any unlikely chance, to know a man more blest in a laugh than Scrooge’s nephew, all I can say is, I should like to know him too. Introduce him to me, and I’ll cultivate his acquaintance.\nIt is a fair, even-handed, noble adjustment of things, that while there is infection in disease and sorrow, there is nothing in the world so irresistibly contagious as laughter and good-humour. When Scrooge’s nephew laughed in this way: holding his sides, rolling his head, and twisting his face into the most extravagant contortions: Scrooge’s niece, by marriage, laughed as heartily as he. And their assembled friends being not a bit behindhand, roared out lustily.\n“Ha, ha! Ha, ha, ha, ha!”\n“He said that Christmas was a humbug, as I live!” cried Scrooge’s nephew. “He believed it too!”\n“More shame for him, Fred!” said Scrooge’s niece, indignantly. Bless those women; they never do anything by halves. They are always in earnest.\nShe was very pretty: exceedingly pretty. With a dimpled, surprised-looking, capital face; a ripe little mouth, that seemed made to be kissed—as no doubt it was; all kinds of good little dots about her chin, that melted into one another when she laughed; and the sunniest pair of eyes you ever saw in any little creature’s head. Altogether she was what you would have called provoking, you know; but satisfactory, too. Oh, perfectly satisfactory.\n“He’s a comical old fellow,” said Scrooge’s nephew, “that’s the truth: and not so pleasant as he might be. However, his offences carry their own punishment, and I have nothing to say against him.”\n“I’m sure he is very rich, Fred,” hinted Scrooge’s niece. “At least you always tell me so.”\n“What of that, my dear!” said Scrooge’s nephew. “His wealth is of no use to him. He don’t do any good with it. He don’t make himself comfortable with it. He hasn’t the satisfaction of thinking—ha, ha, ha!—that he is ever going to benefit US with it.”\n“I have no patience with him,” observed Scrooge’s niece. Scrooge’s niece’s sisters, and all the other ladies, expressed the same opinion.\n“Oh, I have!” said Scrooge’s nephew. “I am sorry for him; I couldn’t be angry with him if I tried. Who suffers by his ill whims! Himself, always. Here, he takes it into his head to dislike us, and he won’t come and dine with us. What’s the consequence? He don’t lose much of a dinner.”\n“Indeed, I think he loses a very good dinner,” interrupted Scrooge’s niece. Everybody else said the same, and they must be allowed to have been competent judges, because they had just had dinner; and, with the dessert upon the table, were clustered round the fire, by lamplight.\n“Well! I’m very glad to hear it,” said Scrooge’s nephew, “because I haven’t great faith in these young housekeepers. What do you say, Topper?”\nTopper had clearly got his eye upon one of Scrooge’s niece’s sisters, for he answered that a bachelor was a wretched outcast, who had no right to express an opinion on the subject. Whereat Scrooge’s niece’s sister—the plump one with the lace tucker: not the one with the roses—blushed.\n“Do go on, Fred,” said Scrooge’s niece, clapping her hands. “He never finishes what he begins to say! He is such a ridiculous fellow!”\nScrooge’s nephew revelled in another laugh, and as it was impossible to keep the infection off; though the plump sister tried hard to do it with aromatic vinegar; his example was unanimously followed.\n“I was only going to say,” said Scrooge’s nephew, “that the consequence of his taking a dislike to us, and not making merry with us, is, as I think, that he loses some pleasant moments, which could do him no harm. I am sure he loses pleasanter companions than he can find in his own thoughts, either in his mouldy old office, or his dusty chambers. I mean to give him the same chance every year, whether he likes it or not, for I pity him. He may rail at Christmas till he dies, but he can’t help thinking better of it—I defy him—if he finds me going there, in good temper, year after year, and saying Uncle Scrooge, how are you? If it only puts him in the vein to leave his poor clerk fifty pounds, that’s something; and I think I shook him yesterday.”\nIt was their turn to laugh now at the notion of his shaking Scrooge. But being thoroughly good-natured, and not much caring what they laughed at, so that they laughed at any rate, he encouraged them in their merriment, and passed the bottle joyously.\nAfter tea, they had some music. For they were a musical family, and knew what they were about, when they sung a Glee or Catch, I can assure you: especially Topper, who could growl away in the bass like a good one, and never swell the large veins in his forehead, or get red in the face over it. Scrooge’s niece played well upon the harp; and played among other tunes a simple little air (a mere nothing: you might learn to whistle it in two minutes), which had been familiar to the child who fetched Scrooge from the boarding-school, as he had been reminded by the Ghost of Christmas Past. When this strain of music sounded, all the things that Ghost had shown him, came upon his mind; he softened more and more; and thought that if he could have listened to it often, years ago, he might have cultivated the kindnesses of life for his own happiness with his own hands, without resorting to the sexton’s spade that buried Jacob Marley.\nBut they didn’t devote the whole evening to music. After a while they played at forfeits; for it is good to be children sometimes, and never better than at Christmas, when its mighty Founder was a child himself. Stop! There was first a game at blind-man’s buff. Of course there was. And I no more believe Topper was really blind than I believe he had eyes in his boots. My opinion is, that it was a done thing between him and Scrooge’s nephew; and that the Ghost of Christmas Present knew it. The way he went after that plump sister in the lace tucker, was an outrage on the credulity of human nature. Knocking down the fire-irons, tumbling over the chairs, bumping against the piano, smothering himself among the curtains, wherever she went, there went he! He always knew where the plump sister was. He wouldn’t catch anybody else. If you had fallen up against him (as some of them did), on purpose, he would have made a feint of endeavouring to seize you, which would have been an affront to your understanding, and would instantly have sidled off in the direction of the plump sister. She often cried out that it wasn’t fair; and it really was not. But when at last, he caught her; when, in spite of all her silken rustlings, and her rapid flutterings past him, he got her into a corner whence there was no escape; then his conduct was the most execrable. For his pretending not to know her; his pretending that it was necessary to touch her head-dress, and further to assure himself of her identity by pressing a certain ring upon her finger, and a certain chain about her neck; was vile, monstrous! No doubt she told him her opinion of it, when, another blind-man being in office, they were so very confidential together, behind the curtains.\nScrooge’s niece was not one of the blind-man’s buff party, but was made comfortable with a large chair and a footstool, in a snug corner, where the Ghost and Scrooge were close behind her. But she joined in the forfeits, and loved her love to admiration with all the letters of the alphabet. Likewise at the game of How, When, and Where, she was very great, and to the secret joy of Scrooge’s nephew, beat her sisters hollow: though they were sharp girls too, as Topper could have told you. There might have been twenty people there, young and old, but they all played, and so did Scrooge; for wholly forgetting in the interest he had in what was going on, that his voice made no sound in their ears, he sometimes came out with his guess quite loud, and very often guessed quite right, too; for the sharpest needle, best Whitechapel, warranted not to cut in the eye, was not sharper than Scrooge; blunt as he took it in his head to be.\nThe Ghost was greatly pleased to find him in this mood, and looked upon him with such favour, that he begged like a boy to be allowed to stay until the guests departed. But this the Spirit said could not be done.\n“Here is a new game,” said Scrooge. “One half hour, Spirit, only one!”\nIt was a Game called Yes and No, where Scrooge’s nephew had to think of something, and the rest must find out what; he only answering to their questions yes or no, as the case was. The brisk fire of questioning to which he was exposed, elicited from him that he was thinking of an animal, a live animal, rather a disagreeable animal, a savage animal, an animal that growled and grunted sometimes, and talked sometimes, and lived in London, and walked about the streets, and wasn’t made a show of, and wasn’t led by anybody, and didn’t live in a menagerie, and was never killed in a market, and was not a horse, or an ass, or a cow, or a bull, or a tiger, or a dog, or a pig, or a cat, or a bear. At every fresh question that was put to him, this nephew burst into a fresh roar of laughter; and was so inexpressibly tickled, that he was obliged to get up off the sofa and stamp. At last the plump sister, falling into a similar state, cried out:\n“I have found it out! I know what it is, Fred! I know what it is!”\n“What is it?” cried Fred.\n“It’s your Uncle Scro-o-o-o-oge!”\nWhich it certainly was. Admiration was the universal sentiment, though some objected that the reply to “Is it a bear?” ought to have been “Yes;” inasmuch as an answer in the negative was sufficient to have diverted their thoughts from Mr. Scrooge, supposing they had ever had any tendency that way.",

Here is a glass of mulled wine ready to our hand at the moment; and I say, ‘Uncle Scrooge!’ ”\n“Well! Uncle Scrooge!” they cried.\n“A Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year to the old man, whatever he is!” said Scrooge’s nephew. “He wouldn’t take it from me, but may he have it, nevertheless. Uncle Scrooge!”\nUncle Scrooge had imperceptibly become so gay and light of heart, that he would have pledged the unconscious company in return, and thanked them in an inaudible speech, if the Ghost had given him time. But the whole scene passed off in the breath of the last word spoken by his nephew; and he and the Spirit were again upon their travels.\nMuch they saw, and far they went, and many homes they visited, but always with a happy end. The Spirit stood beside sick beds, and they were cheerful; on foreign lands, and they were close at home; by struggling men, and they were patient in their greater hope; by poverty, and it was rich. In almshouse, hospital, and jail, in misery’s every refuge, where vain man in his little brief authority had not made fast the door, and barred the Spirit out, he left his blessing, and taught Scrooge his precepts.\nIt was a long night, if it were only a night; but Scrooge had his doubts of this, because the Christmas Holidays appeared to be condensed into the space of time they passed together. It was strange, too, that while Scrooge remained unaltered in his outward form, the Ghost grew older, clearly older. Scrooge had observed this change, but never spoke of it, until they left a children’s Twelfth Night party, when, looking at the Spirit as they stood together in an open place, he noticed that its hair was grey.\n“Are spirits’ lives so short?” asked Scrooge.\n“My life upon this globe, is very brief,” replied the Ghost. “It ends to-night.”\n“To-night!” cried Scrooge.\n“To-night at midnight. Hark! The time is drawing near.”\nThe chimes were ringing the three quarters past eleven at that moment.\n“Forgive me if I am not justified in what I ask,” said Scrooge, looking intently at the Spirit’s robe, “but I see something strange, and not belonging to yourself, protruding from your skirts. Is it a foot or a claw?”\n“It might be a claw, for the flesh there is upon it,” was the Spirit’s sorrowful reply. “Look here.”\nFrom the foldings of its robe, it brought two children; wretched, abject, frightful, hideous, miserable. They knelt down at its feet, and clung upon the outside of its garment.\n“Oh, Man! look here. Look, look, down here!” exclaimed the Ghost.\nThey were a boy and girl. Yellow, meagre, ragged, scowling, wolfish; but prostrate, too, in their humility. Where graceful youth should have filled their features out, and touched them with its freshest tints, a stale and shrivelled hand, like that of age, had pinched, and twisted them, and pulled them into shreds. Where angels might have sat enthroned, devils lurked, and glared out menacing. No change, no degradation, no perversion of humanity, in any grade, through all the mysteries of wonderful creation, has monsters half so horrible and dread.\nScrooge started back, appalled. Having them shown to him in this way, he tried to say they were fine children, but the words choked themselves, rather than be parties to a lie of such enormous magnitude.\n“Spirit! are they yours?” Scrooge could say no more.\n“They are Man’s,” said the Spirit, looking down upon them. “And they cling to me, appealing from their fathers. This boy is Ignorance. This girl is Want. Beware them both, and all of their degree, but most of all beware this boy, for on his brow I see that written which is Doom, unless the writing be erased. Deny it!” cried the Spirit, stretching out its hand towards the city. “Slander those who tell it ye! Admit it for your factious purposes, and make it worse. And bide the end!”\n“Have they no refuge or resource?” cried Scrooge.\n“Are there no prisons?” said the Spirit, turning on him for the last time with his own words. “Are there no workhouses?”\nThe bell struck twelve.\nScrooge looked about him for the Ghost, and saw it not. As the last stroke ceased to vibrate, he remembered the prediction of old Jacob Marley, and lifting up his eyes, beheld a solemn Phantom, draped and hooded, coming, like a mist along the ground, towards him.",

A Christmas Carol is a story of redemption, of a man who was once cold-hearted and selfish, but who, through the intervention of three spirits, came to see the error of his ways and the joy of giving. It is a tale that reminds us of the true spirit of Christmas, not in the gifts we receive, but in the love we give. Fred's words are a testament to the power of forgiveness and the importance of celebrating the holidays with those we hold dear. In the end, Scrooge's transformation is a reminder that it is never too late to change, to embrace the warmth of the season, and to find joy in the company of others. The story of A Christmas Carol is not just about one man's journey, but about the universal message of hope, redemption, and the enduring power of the human spirit. It is a story that continues to touch the hearts of readers and listeners around the world, reminding us all of the importance of kindness, generosity, and the true meaning of Christmas."

When it came near him, Scrooge bent down upon his knee; for in the very air through which this Spirit moved it seemed to scatter gloom and mystery.\nIt was shrouded in a deep black garment, which concealed its head, its face, its form, and left nothing of it visible save one outstretched hand. But for this it would have been difficult to detach its figure from the night, and separate it from the darkness by which it was surrounded.\nHe felt that it was tall and stately when it came beside him, and that its mysterious presence filled him with a solemn dread. He knew no more, for the Spirit neither spoke nor moved.\n“I am in the presence of the Ghost of Christmas Yet To Come?” said Scrooge.\nThe Spirit answered not, but pointed onward with its hand.\n“You are about to show me shadows of the things that have not happened, but will happen in the time before us,” Scrooge pursued. “Is that so, Spirit?”\nThe upper portion of the garment was contracted for an instant in its folds, as if the Spirit had inclined its head. That was the only answer he received.\nAlthough well used to ghostly company by this time, Scrooge feared the silent shape so much that his legs trembled beneath him, and he found that he could hardly stand when he prepared to follow it. The Spirit paused a moment, as observing his condition, and giving him time to recover.\nBut Scrooge was all the worse for this. It thrilled him with a vague uncertain horror, to know that behind the dusky shroud, there were ghostly eyes intently fixed upon him, while he, though he stretched his own to the utmost, could see nothing but a spectral hand and one great heap of black.\n“Ghost of the Future!” he exclaimed, “I fear you more than any spectre I have seen. But as I know your purpose is to do me good, and as I hope to live to be another man from what I was, I am prepared to bear you company, and do it with a thankful heart. Will you not speak to me?”\nIt gave him no reply. The hand was pointed straight before them.\n“Lead on!” said Scrooge. “Lead on! The night is waning fast, and it is precious time to me, I know.

But there they were, in the heart of it; on ’Change, amongst the merchants; who hurried up and down, and chinked the money in their pockets, and conversed in groups, and looked at their watches, and trifled thoughtfully with their great gold seals; and so forth, as Scrooge had seen them often.\nThe Spirit stopped beside one little knot of business men. Observing that the hand was pointed to them, Scrooge advanced to listen to their talk.\n“No,” said a great fat man with a monstrous chin, “I don’t know much about it, either way. I only know he’s dead.”\n“When did he die?” inquired another.\n“Last night, I believe.”\n“Why, what was the matter with him?” asked a third, taking a vast quantity of snuff out of a very large snuff-box. “I thought he’d never die.”\n“God knows,” said the first, with a yawn.\n“What has he done with his money?” asked a red-faced gentleman with a pendulous excrescence on the end of his nose, that shook like the gills of a turkey-cock.\n“I haven’t heard,” said the man with the large chin, yawning again. “Left it to his company, perhaps. He hasn’t left it to me. That’s all I know.”\nThis pleasantry was received with a general laugh.\n“It’s likely to be a very cheap funeral,” said the same speaker; “for upon my life I don’t know of anybody to go to it. Suppose we make up a party and volunteer?”\n“I don’t mind going if a lunch is provided,” observed the gentleman with the excrescence on his nose. “But I must be fed, if I make one.”\nAnother laugh.\n“Well, I am the most disinterested among you, after all,” said the first speaker, “for I never wear black gloves, and I never eat lunch. But I’ll offer to go, if anybody else will. When I come to think of it, I’m not at all sure that I wasn’t his most particular friend; for we used to stop and speak whenever we met. Bye, bye!”\nSpeakers and listeners strolled away, and mixed with other groups. Scrooge knew the men, and looked towards the Spirit for an explanation.\nThe Phantom glided on into a street. Its finger pointed to two persons meeting. Scrooge listened again, thinking that the explanation might lie here.\nHe knew these men, also, perfectly. They were men of business: very wealthy, and of great importance. He had made a point always of standing well in their esteem: in a business point of view, that is; strictly in a business point of view.\n“How are you?” said one.\n“How are you?” returned the other.\n“Well!” said the first. “Old Scratch has got his own at last, hey?”\n“So I am told,” returned the second. “Cold, isn’t it?”\n“Seasonable for Christmas time. You’re not a skater, I suppose?”\n“No. No. Something else to think of. Good morning!”\nNot another word. That was their meeting, their conversation, and their parting.\nScrooge was at first inclined to be surprised that the Spirit should attach importance to conversations apparently so trivial; but feeling assured that they must have some hidden purpose, he set himself to consider what it was likely to be. They could scarcely be supposed to have any bearing on the death of Jacob, his old partner, for that was Past, and this Ghost’s province was the Future. Nor could he think of any one immediately connected with himself, to whom he could apply them. But nothing doubting that to whomsoever they applied they had some latent moral for his own improvement, he resolved to treasure up every word he heard, and everything he saw; and especially to observe the shadow of himself when it appeared. For he had an expectation that the conduct of his future self would give him the clue he missed, and would render the solution of these riddles easy.\nHe looked about in that very place for his own image; but another man stood in his accustomed corner, and though the clock pointed to his usual time of day for being there, he saw no likeness of himself among the multitudes that poured in through the Porch. It gave him little surprise, however; for he had been revolving in his mind a change of life, and thought and hoped he saw his new-born resolutions carried out in this.\nQuiet and dark, beside him stood the Phantom, with its outstretched hand. When he roused himself from his thoughtful quest, he fancied from the turn of the hand, and its situation in reference to himself, that the Unseen Eyes were looking at him keenly. It made him shudder, and feel very cold.",

It was an exceedingly dense, dark, and murky atmosphere, but the Spirit’s radiance shone through it, and clearly lighted up the crowded streets. The merchants were huddled together in groups, and the Spirit, with a slow and stately motion, pointed to one of them.

          "text_segment": "They left the busy scene, and went into an obscure part of the town, where Scrooge had never penetrated before, although he recognised its situation, and its bad repute. The ways were foul and narrow; the shops and houses wretched; the people half-naked, drunken, slipshod, ugly. Alleys and archways, like so many cesspools, disgorged their offences of smell, and dirt, and life, upon the straggling streets; and the whole quarter reeked with crime, with filth, and misery.\nFar in this den of infamous resort, there was a low-browed, beetling shop, below a pent-house roof, where iron, old rags, bottles, bones, and greasy offal, were bought. Upon the floor within, were piled up heaps of rusty keys, nails, chains, hinges, files, scales, weights, and refuse iron of all kinds. Secrets that few would like to scrutinise were bred and hidden in mountains of unseemly rags, masses of corrupted fat, and sepulchres of bones. Sitting in among the wares he dealt in, by a charcoal stove, made of old bricks, was a grey-haired rascal, nearly seventy years of age; who had screened himself from the cold air without, by a frousy curtaining of miscellaneous tatters, hung upon a line; and smoked his pipe in all the luxury of calm retirement.\nScrooge and the Phantom came into the presence of this man, just as a woman with a heavy bundle slunk into the shop. But she had scarcely entered, when another woman, similarly laden, came in too; and she was closely followed by a man in faded black, who was no less startled by the sight of them, than they had been upon the recognition of each other. After a short period of blank astonishment, in which the old man with the pipe had joined them, they all three burst into a laugh.\n“Let the charwoman alone to be the first!” cried she who had entered first. “Let the laundress alone to be the second; and let the undertaker’s man alone to be the third. Look here, old Joe, here’s a chance! If we haven’t all three met here without meaning it!”\n“You couldn’t have met in a better place,” said old Joe, removing his pipe from his mouth. “Come into the parlour. You were made free of it long ago, you know; and the other two an’t strangers. Stop till I shut the door of the shop. Ah! How it skreeks! There an’t such a rusty bit of metal in the place as its own hinges, I believe; and I’m sure there’s no such old bones here, as mine. Ha, ha! We’re all suitable to our calling, we’re well matched. Come into the parlour. Come into the parlour.”\nThe parlour was the space behind the screen of rags. The old man raked the fire together with an old stair-rod, and having trimmed his smoky lamp (for it was night), with the stem of his pipe, put it in his mouth again.\nWhile he did this, the woman who had already spoken threw her bundle on the floor, and sat down in a flaunting manner on a stool; crossing her elbows on her knees, and looking with a bold defiance at the other two.\n“What odds then! What odds, Mrs. Dilber?” said the woman. “Every person has a right to take care of themselves. He always did.”\n“That’s true, indeed!” said the laundress. “No man more so.”\n“Why then, don’t stand staring as if you was afraid, woman; who’s the wiser? We’re not going to pick holes in each other’s coats, I suppose?”\n“No, indeed!” said Mrs. Dilber and the man together. “We should hope not.”\n“Very well, then!” cried the woman. “That’s enough. Who’s the worse for the loss of a few things like these? Not a dead man, I suppose.”\n“No, indeed,” said Mrs. Dilber, laughing.\n“If he wanted to keep ’em after he was dead, a wicked old screw,” pursued the woman, “why wasn’t he natural in his lifetime? If he had been, he’d have had somebody to look after him when he was struck with Death, instead of lying gasping out his last there, alone by himself.”\n“It’s the truest word that ever was spoke,” said Mrs. Dilber. “It’s a judgment on him.”\n“I wish it was a little heavier judgment,” replied the woman; “and it should have been, you may depend upon it, if I could have laid my hands on anything else. Open that bundle, old Joe, and let me know the value of it. Speak out plain. I’m not afraid to be the first, nor afraid for them to see it. We know pretty well that we were helping ourselves, before we met here, I believe. It’s no sin. Open the bundle, Joe.”\nBut the gallantry of her friends would not allow of this; and the man in faded black, mounting the breach first, produced his plunder. It was not extensive. A seal or two, a pencil-case, a pair of sleeve-buttons, and a brooch of no great value, were all. They were severally examined and appraised by old Joe, who chalked the sums he was disposed to give for each, upon the wall, and added them up into a total when he found there was nothing more to come.\n“That’s your account,” said Joe, “and I wouldn’t give another sixpence, if I was to be boiled for not doing it. Who’s next?”\nMrs. Dilber was next. Sheets and towels, a little wearing apparel, two old-fashioned silver teaspoons, a pair of sugar-tongs, and a few boots. Her account was stated on the wall in the same manner.\n“I always give too much to ladies. It’s a weakness of mine, and that’s the way I ruin myself,” said old Joe. “That’s your account. If you asked me for another penny, and made it an open question, I’d repent of being so liberal and knock off half-a-crown.”\n“And now undo my bundle, Joe,” said the first woman.\nJoe went down on his knees for the greater convenience of opening it, and having unfastened a great many knots, dragged out a large and heavy roll of some dark stuff.\n“What do you call this?” said Joe. “Bed-curtains!”\n“Ah!” returned the woman, laughing and leaning forward on her crossed arms. “Bed-curtains!”\n“You don’t mean to say you took ’em down, rings and all, with him lying there?” said Joe.\n“Yes I do,” replied the woman. “Why not?”\n“You were born to make your fortune,” said Joe, “and you’ll certainly do it.”\n“I certainly shan’t hold my hand, when I can get anything in it by reaching it out, for the sake of such a man as He was, I promise you, Joe,” returned the woman coolly. “Don’t drop that oil upon the blankets, now.”\n“His blankets?” asked Joe.\n“Whose else’s do you think?” replied the woman. “He isn’t likely to take cold without ’em, I dare say.”\n“I hope he didn’t die of anything catching? Eh?” said old Joe, stopping in his work, and looking up.\n“Don’t you be afraid of that,” returned the woman. “I an’t so fond of his company that I’d loiter about him for such things, if he did. Ah! you may look through that shirt till your eyes ache; but you won’t find a hole in it, nor a threadbare place. It’s the best he had, and a fine one too. They’d have wasted it, if it hadn’t been for me.”\n“What do you call wasting of it?” asked old Joe.\n“Putting it on him to be buried in, to be sure,” replied the woman with a laugh. “Somebody was fool enough to do it, but I took it off again. If calico an’t good enough for such a purpose, it isn’t good enough for anything. It’s quite as becoming to the body. He can’t look uglier than he did in that one.”\nScrooge listened to this dialogue in horror. As they sat grouped about their spoil, in the scanty light afforded by the old man’s lamp, he viewed them with a detestation and disgust, which could hardly have been greater, though they had been obscene demons, marketing the corpse itself.\n“Ha, ha!” laughed the same woman, when old Joe, producing a flannel bag with money in it, told out their several gains upon the ground. “This is the end of it, you see! He frightened every one away from him when he was alive, to profit us when he was dead! Ha, ha, ha!”\n“Spirit!” said Scrooge, shuddering from head to foot. “I see, I see. The case of this unhappy man might be my own. My life tends that way, now. Merciful Heaven, what is this!”\n",

The man who presided here, was a grey-haired rascal, barely civil, sly, and sleuth-like in his manner. He had a quantity of old ragged clothes, and other things, in a state of decomposition, and a quantity of old rags, and other things, in a state of preservation, and a quantity of old rags, and other things, in a state of transition. He was called Old Joe, and he was a man of no account, and of no consequence, and of no importance, and of no value, and of no worth, and of no weight, and of no weight at all.\n\nThe Spirit guided Scrooge into the shop, and they found themselves in a room behind the counter, where the air was thick with the smell of decay, and the walls were lined with the remnants of a thousand lives. Here, the charwoman, the laundress, and the undertaker's man met by chance, each carrying a bundle. They looked at one another with a kind of startled recognition, and then burst into laughter, as if they had been expecting each other all along.\n\n\"Well, well, well!\" said the charwoman, with a grin. \"What a curious meeting this is!\"\n\n\"Indeed it is,\" said the laundress, Mrs. Dilber, with a chuckle. \"I never thought to see the day when we'd all be here together!\"\n\n\"Nor I,\" said the undertaker's man, with a grin. \"But I suppose it's the way of things.\"\n\nOld Joe, who had been watching them with a shrewd eye, now stepped forward and invited them into his 'parlour,' which was a corner of the room behind a screen of rags. The charwoman, bold and unashamed, presented her bundle first. \"This,\" she said, \"is the shirt the old man was to be buried in. I took it because it was too good to waste. Calico is sufficient for a corpse that can't look worse than it already does.\"\n\nThe others nodded in agreement, and Old Joe appraised the shirt with a knowing eye. The undertaker's man then presented his plunder: a few seals, a pencil-case, some buttons, and a brooch. Old Joe appraised these as well, and recorded their value. Mrs. Dilber followed with sheets, towels, clothes, silver teaspoons, sugar-tongs, and boots, which Old Joe also appraised.\n\nFinally, the charwoman revealed her main prize: the dead man's bed-curtains, taken down while he lay there. She showed them to Old Joe with a triumphant air, and then, with a flourish, she produced the fine shirt again, and declared that she had taken it because it was too good to waste.\n\nScrooge watched this scene with mounting horror, detestation, and disgust. He saw the charwoman's boldness, the laundress's cunning, the undertaker's man's meanness, and the old man's slyness. He saw the way they all laughed and joked about the dead man's misfortunes, and how they all profited from his death. He saw the way they all looked at each other with a kind of camaraderie, as if they were all in on the same joke.\n\nAs Old Joe paid them, the charwoman laughed and said, \"Aye, aye! The man who alienated everyone in life has profited us in death!\"\n\nScrooge, trembling, turned to the Spirit and said, \"I understand. I understand now. This is what awaits me if I continue on this path.\"\n\nThe Spirit nodded, and Scrooge felt a shudder run through him. He knew, with a terrible certainty, that this was the fate that awaited him if he did not change.",

He was called Old Joe, and he was a man of no account, and of no consequence, and of no importance, and of no value, and of no worth, and of no weight, and of no weight at all.\n\nThe Spirit guided Scrooge into the shop, and they found themselves in a room behind the counter, where the air was thick with the smell of decay, and the walls were lined with the remnants of a thousand lives. Here, the charwoman, the laundress, and the undertaker's man met by chance, each carrying a bundle. They looked at one another with a kind of startled recognition, and then burst into laughter, as if they had been expecting each other all along.\n\n\"Well, well, well!\" said the charwoman, with a grin. \"What a curious meeting this is!\"\n\n\"Indeed it is,\" said the laundress, Mrs. Dilber, with a chuckle. \"I never thought to see the day when we'd all be here together!\"\n\n\"Nor I,\" said the undertaker's man, with a grin. \"But I suppose it's the way of things.\"\n\nOld Joe, who had been watching them with a shrewd eye, now stepped forward and invited them into his 'parlour,' which was a corner of the room behind a screen of rags. The charwoman, bold and unashamed, presented her bundle first. \"This,\" she said, \"is the shirt the old man was to be buried in. I took it because it was too good to waste. Calico is sufficient for a corpse that can't look worse than it already does.\"\n\nThe others nodded in agreement, and Old Joe appraised the shirt with a knowing eye. The undertaker's man then presented his plunder: a few seals, a pencil-case, some buttons, and a brooch. Old Joe appraised these as well, and recorded their value. Mrs. Dilber followed with sheets, towels, clothes, silver teaspoons, sugar-tongs, and boots, which Old Joe also appraised.\n\nFinally, the charwoman revealed her main prize: the dead man's bed-curtains, taken down while he lay there. She showed them to Old Joe with a triumphant air, and then, with a flourish, she produced the fine shirt again, and declared that she had taken it because it was too good to waste.\n\nScrooge watched this scene with mounting horror, detestation, and disgust. He saw the charwoman's boldness, the laundress's cunning, the undertaker's man's meanness, and the old man's slyness. He saw the way they all laughed and joked about the dead man's misfortunes, and how they all profited from his death. He saw the way they all looked at each other with a kind of camaraderie, as if they were all in on the same joke.\n\nAs Old Joe paid them, the charwoman laughed and said, \"Aye, aye! The man who alienated everyone in life has profited us in death!\"\n\nScrooge, trembling, turned to the Spirit and said, \"I understand. I understand now. This is what awaits me if I continue on this path.\"\n\nThe Spirit nodded, and Scrooge felt a shudder run through him. He knew, with a terrible certainty, that this was the fate that awaited him if he did not change.",

A pale light, rising in the outer air, fell straight upon the bed; and on it, plundered and bereft, unwatched, unwept, uncared for, was the body of this man.\nScrooge glanced towards the Phantom. Its steady hand was pointed to the head. The cover was so carelessly adjusted that the slightest raising of it, the motion of a finger upon Scrooge’s part, would have disclosed the face. He thought of it, felt how easy it would be to do, and longed to do it; but had no more power to withdraw the veil than to dismiss the spectre at his side.\nOh cold, cold, rigid, dreadful Death, set up thine altar here, and dress it with such terrors as thou hast at thy command: for this is thy dominion! But of the loved, revered, and honoured head, thou canst not turn one hair to thy dread purposes, or make one feature odious. It is not that the hand is heavy and will fall down when released; it is not that the heart and pulse are still; but that the hand was open, generous, and true; the heart brave, warm, and tender; and the pulse a man’s. Strike, Shadow, strike! And see his good deeds springing from the wound, to sow the world with life immortal!\nNo voice pronounced these words in Scrooge’s ears, and yet he heard them when he looked upon the bed. He thought, if this man could be raised up now, what would be his foremost thoughts? Avarice, hard-dealing, griping cares? They have brought him to a rich end, truly!\nHe lay, in the dark empty house, with not a man, a woman, or a child, to say that he was kind to me in this or that, and for the memory of one kind word I will be kind to him. A cat was tearing at the door, and there was a sound of gnawing rats beneath the hearth-stone. What they wanted in the room of death, and why they were so restless and disturbed, Scrooge did not dare to think.\n“Spirit!” he said, “this is a fearful place. In leaving it, I shall not leave its lesson, trust me. Let us go!”\nStill the Ghost pointed with an unmoved finger to the head.\n“I understand you,” Scrooge returned, “and I would do it, if I could. But I have not the power, Spirit. I have not the power.”\nAgain it seemed to look upon him.\n“If there is any person in the town, who feels emotion caused by this man’s death,” said Scrooge quite agonised, “show that person to me, Spirit, I beseech you!”",

She hurried to the door, and met her husband; a man whose face was careworn and depressed, though he was young. There was a remarkable expression in it now; a kind of serious delight of which he felt ashamed, and which he struggled to repress.\nHe sat down to the dinner that had been hoarding for him by the fire; and when she asked him faintly what news (which was not until after a long silence), he appeared embarrassed how to answer.\n“Is it good?” she said, “or bad?”—to help him.\n“Bad,” he answered.\n“We are quite ruined?”\n“No. There is hope yet, Caroline.”\n“If he relents,” she said, amazed, “there is! Nothing is past hope, if such a miracle has happened.”\n“He is past relenting,” said her husband. “He is dead.”\nShe was a mild and patient creature if her face spoke truth; but she was thankful in her soul to hear it, and she said so, with clasped hands.

He was not only very ill, but dying, then.”\n“To whom will our debt be transferred?”\n“I don’t know. But before that time we shall be ready with the money; and even though we were not, it would be a bad fortune indeed to find so merciless a creditor in his successor. We may sleep to-night with light hearts, Caroline!”\nYes. Soften it as they would, their hearts were lighter.

The mother and her children were poor, but they were happy, and their happiness was not dependent on wealth or possessions. It was something deeper and more lasting, something that came from the heart. Scrooge felt a pang of sorrow as he looked at them, and he wondered if he had ever known such happiness. He had been a lonely man, and he had built a wall around his heart, so that no one could reach him. But now, as he watched the mother and her children, he felt the wall begin to crack, and a light began to shine through. The Phantom did not speak, but it looked at him with a knowing eye, as if it understood the change that was taking place within him. Scrooge turned away, and the vision faded, and the room was dark once more. But the memory of it remained with him, and it stayed with him long after the Phantom had gone. It was the first of many visions that would come to him that night, and it was the beginning of a journey that would change his life forever."

          "text_segment": "“Let me see some tenderness connected with a death,” said Scrooge; “or that dark chamber, Spirit, which we left just now, will be for ever present to me.”\nThe Ghost conducted him through several streets familiar to his feet; and as they went along, Scrooge looked here and there to find himself, but nowhere was he to be seen. They entered poor Bob Cratchit’s house; the dwelling he had visited before; and found the mother and the children seated round the fire.\nQuiet. Very quiet. The noisy little Cratchits were as still as statues in one corner, and sat looking up at Peter, who had a book before him. The mother and her daughters were engaged in sewing. But surely they were very quiet!\n“ ‘And He took a child, and set him in the midst of them.’ ”\nWhere had Scrooge heard those words? He had not dreamed them. The boy must have read them out, as he and the Spirit crossed the threshold. Why did he not go on?\nThe mother laid her work upon the table, and put her hand up to her face.\n“The colour hurts my eyes,” she said.\nThe colour? Ah, poor Tiny Tim!\n“They’re better now again,” said Cratchit’s wife. “It makes them weak by candle-light; and I wouldn’t show weak eyes to your father when he comes home, for the world. It must be near his time.”\n“Past it rather,” Peter answered, shutting up his book. “But I think he has walked a little slower than he used, these few last evenings, mother.”\nThey were very quiet again. At last she said, and in a steady, cheerful voice, that only faltered once:\n“I have known him walk with—I have known him walk with Tiny Tim upon his shoulder, very fast indeed.”\n“And so have I,” cried Peter. “Often.”\n“And so have I,” exclaimed another. So had all.\n“But he was very light to carry,” she resumed, intent upon her work, “and his father loved him so, that it was no trouble: no trouble. And there is your father at the door!”\nShe hurried out to meet him; and little Bob in his comforter—he had need of it, poor fellow—came in. His tea was ready for him on the hob, and they all tried who should help him to it most. Then the two young Cratchits got upon his knees and laid, each child a little cheek, against his face, as if they said, “Don’t mind it, father. Don’t be grieved!”\nBob was very cheerful with them, and spoke pleasantly to all the family. He looked at the work upon the table, and praised the industry and speed of Mrs. Cratchit and the girls. They would be done long before Sunday, he said.\n“Sunday! You went to-day, then, Robert?” said his wife.\n“Yes, my dear,” returned Bob. “I wish you could have gone. It would have done you good to see how green a place it is. But you’ll see it often. I promised him that I would walk there on a Sunday. My little, little child!” cried Bob. “My little child!”\nHe broke down all at once. He couldn’t help it. If he could have helped it, he and his child would have been farther apart perhaps than they were.\nHe left the room, and went up-stairs into the room above, which was lighted cheerfully, and hung with Christmas. There was a chair set close beside the child, and there were signs of some one having been there, lately. Poor Bob sat down in it, and when he had thought a little and composed himself, he kissed the little face. He was reconciled to what had happened, and went down again quite happy.\nThey drew about the fire, and talked; the girls and mother working still. Bob told them of the extraordinary kindness of Mr. Scrooge’s nephew, whom he had scarcely seen but once, and who, meeting him in the street that day, and seeing that he looked a little—“just a little down you know,” said Bob, inquired what had happened to distress him. “On which,” said Bob, “for he is the pleasantest-spoken gentleman you ever heard, I told him. ‘I am heartily sorry for it, Mr. Cratchit,’ he said, ‘and heartily sorry for your good wife.’ By the bye, how he ever knew that, I don’t know.”\n“Knew what, my dear?”\n“Why, that you were a good wife,” replied Bob.\n“Everybody knows that!” said Peter.\n“Very well observed, my boy!” cried Bob. “I hope they do. ‘Heartily sorry,’ he said, ‘for your good wife. If I can be of service to you in any way,’ he said, giving me his card, ‘that’s where I live. Pray come to me.’ Now, it wasn’t,” cried Bob, “for the sake of anything he might be able to do for us, so much as for his kind way, that this was quite delightful. It really seemed as if he had known our Tiny Tim, and felt with us.”\n“I’m sure he’s a good soul!” said Mrs. Cratchit.\n“You would be surer of it, my dear,” returned Bob, “if you saw and spoke to him. I shouldn’t be at all surprised—mark what I say!—if he got Peter a better situation.”\n“Only hear that, Peter,” said Mrs. Cratchit.\n“And then,” cried one of the girls, “Peter will be keeping company with some one, and setting up for himself.”\n“Get along with you!” retorted Peter, grinning.\n“It’s just as likely as not,” said Bob, “one of these days; though there’s plenty of time for that, my dear. But however and whenever we part from one another, I am sure we shall none of us forget poor Tiny Tim—shall we—or this first parting that there was among us?”\n“Never, father!” cried they all.\n“And I know,” said Bob, “I know, my dears, that when we recollect how patient and how mild he was; although he was a little, little child; we shall not quarrel easily among ourselves, and forget poor Tiny Tim in doing it.”\n“No, never, father!” they all cried again.\n“I am very happy,” said little Bob, “I am very happy!”\nMrs. Cratchit kissed him, his daughters kissed him, the two young Cratchits kissed him, and Peter and himself shook hands. Spirit of Tiny Tim, thy childish essence was from God!",

Let us remember his patience and his mildness, and may it keep us from quarreling.” He smiled, and the family embraced, their love and memory binding them together in the face of loss.\n\nAnd so, in the quiet of the Cratchit home, Scrooge saw the tenderness he had longed for — not in grand gestures, but in the quiet strength of a family that had lost much but still found joy in each other.\n```\n\n---\n\n**Explanation of the Output:**\n\nThis simulated output reflects the function's purpose: to generate a literary segment that aligns with the metadata provided.

At the motion, one of the two great extinguishers, in which the light had been fading, was hidden in the Spirit’s hand. In an instant, the light图 of the room was brighter than before; and the bed on which the dying man lay was in sight.\n\nIt was a pale, emaciated face, that lay before them; but it was not the face of a man who had been in the habit of being kind, or of showing kindness to others. It was a face that had been worn by years of toil and care, and by the ceaseless struggle for existence. The eyes were sunken, and the skin was yellow and dry. The hands, which had been so often clenched in anger, were now relaxed and powerless. The breath was faint and irregular, and the whole frame seemed to be sinking into the grave.\n\nThe Spirit pointed to the bed, and said, “This is Ebenezer Scrooge.”\n\nScrooge turned his face away, and said, “I am not the man I was. I will not be the man I must have been but for the intervention of the Spirit. I am another man now. I am a changed man, Spirit. I am a new man, I am a better man.”\n\nThe Spirit looked at him with a look of pity, and said, “You are not the man you were, but you are not the man you must be.

Walled in by houses; overrun by grass and weeds, the growth of vegetation’s death, not life; choked up with too much burying; fat with repleted appetite. A worthy place!\nThe Spirit stood among the graves, and pointed down to One. He advanced towards it trembling. The Phantom was exactly as it had been, but he dreaded that he saw new meaning in its solemn shape.\n“Before I draw nearer to that stone to which you point,” said Scrooge, “answer me one question. Are these the shadows of the things that Will be, or are they shadows of things that May be, only?”\nStill the Ghost pointed downward to the grave by which it stood.\n“Men’s courses will foreshadow certain ends, to which, if persevered in, they must lead,” said Scrooge. “But if the courses be departed from, the ends will change. Say it is thus with what you show me!”\nThe Spirit was immovable as ever.\nScrooge crept towards it, trembling as he went; and following the finger, read upon the stone of the neglected grave his own name, Ebenezer Scrooge.\n“Am I that man who lay upon the bed?” he cried, upon his knees.",

But I have a hand that points to what will be. Look upon it, and be warned.”\n\nScrooge, trembling, looked up at the Spirit’s hand. It pointed not to the past, not to the present, but to a future he had never considered. The Spirit led him through the streets of London, where the city bustled with life, but the people moved with a strange, hollow energy. The laughter of children was distant, the warmth of homes was absent, and the joy of the season was nowhere to be found.\n\nThey came upon a funeral. A crowd gathered, but no one wept. The coffin was carried by strangers, and the name on the headstone was unknown to Scrooge. Yet, as he looked closer, he saw the name etched in stone: Ebenezer Scrooge. The realization struck him like a thunderclap. He was to die alone, unloved, and unmourned.\n\nThe Spirit led him to a room where two men sat at a table, speaking in hushed tones. “He was a squeezing, wrenching, grasping, scraping, clutching, covetous, old sinner,” one said. “Hard and sharp as flint, from which no steel had ever struck out generous fire; secret, and self-contained, and solitary as an oyster.”\n\nScrooge recoiled. “I am not that man!” he cried. “I will not be that man!”\n\nThe Spirit did not answer, but only pointed again to the future. They passed by a door where a child sat alone, cold and hungry. The child looked up at Scrooge with eyes full of sorrow. “I know you,” the child said. “You used to give me a little bit of coal for the fire. Now you give me nothing.”\n\nScrooge fell to his knees. “Have I no hope?” he asked. “Is there no way to change this?”\n\nThe Spirit raised its hand, and the vision of the future began to fade. Scrooge awoke in his bed, the morning light streaming through the window. He was alive, and the world was still full of possibility. He had been given a second chance, a chance to change his ways, to be kind, to be generous, to be loved.\n\nAnd so, with a heart full of hope and a spirit full of purpose, Scrooge rose from his bed and began his new life."

Now, if there be any person here who would rather believe that Marley was still, in the old sense, a going, walking, visible sort of spirit, I hold strongly to this belief myself. It is a fair supposition, at least, that he was not. He had no need to be. He was a spirit, and a spirit in the most literal sense. He had no body to go in, and yet he went. He had no face to see with, and yet he saw. He had no voice to speak with, and yet he spoke. He had no ears to hear with, and yet he heard. He had no need of any of these things, for he was a spirit, and spirits are not bound by the laws of the living. He was the ghost of Jacob Marley, and he had come to warn Ebenezer Scrooge of the fate that awaited him if he did not change his ways. The warning was clear: if Scrooge continued to live as he had, he would end up like Marley—bound in chains, tormented by the weight of his own greed and selfishness. The message was simple, but the implications were profound. Scrooge had to change, or he would suffer the same fate as his old business partner. The ghost of Marley had come to show him the way, to give him a chance to escape the grave and the chains that awaited him. It was a chance he could not afford to waste."

Every word he said, every look he gave, every gesture he made, was echoed in the hall below by the expectant crowd. It was a laugh that seemed to shake the very walls of the counting house, a laugh that carried with it the promise of a new beginning. It was not the laugh of a man who had merely changed his mind, but of a man who had changed his heart.

                "text": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this. The user wants me to improve the simulated output of the generate_literary_segment function based on the provided feedback. The original example had several issues, like adding internal reflections and invented dialogue, omitting key details, and altering the sequence of events. \n\nFirst, I need to recall the original text from A Christmas Carol, specifically Stave Five. In the scene where Scrooge visits Fred's house, the key points are his hesitation before knocking, the maid's response, his polite entry, the interaction with Fred and his wife, and the warm reception by the guests. The user's feedback points out that the previous simulation added elements not in the original, like Scrooge's internal thoughts and the maid's dialogue.\n\nSo, I need to stick strictly to the detailed_summary provided. Let me go through each point in the detailed_summary and ensure they're all included. The original opening line is \"He passed the door a dozen times, before he had the courage to go up and knock.\" The simulation should start with that and follow the events as listed.\n\nThe first issue was inventing internal reflections. The original doesn't describe Scrooge's feelings in detail, just his actions. So I should avoid adding phrases like \"the weight of his own past pressing upon him like a shroud.\" Instead, focus on his actions: hesitating, knocking, the maid's response, etc.\n\nNext, the maid's dialogue. The original has Scrooge asking if Fred is at home, and the maid confirming he's in the dining room with his wife. The previous simulation had the maid ask if he's expected and offer to fetch Fred, which isn't in the original. So I need to correct that. The maid's lines should be minimal, just confirming Fred's location.\n\nThen, Scrooge's entry into the dining room. The original mentions he gently opens the door and peeks in. The simulation should include that action, not just stepping in. Also, the original has Fred's wife jumping in surprise, which the previous version included but might need to be more precise.\n\nThe detailed_summary also mentions Scrooge's self-assured entry and the specific interactions. I need to ensure that each step is followed in order: knocking, maid's response, entering the dining room, calling out, Fred's wife's reaction, Fred's exclamation, Scrooge identifying himself, Fred's enthusiastic welcome, and the gathering's atmosphere.\n\nAnother point is the omission of the table's arrangement and the nervousness of the housekeepers. The original might have described the dinner setup and the young housekeepers' anxiety, so I should include that if it's in the detailed_summary. Wait, the detailed_summary does mention \"Fred and his wife inspecting the dinner table setup,\" so that should be included.\n\nAlso, the original has Scrooge's niece by marriage being startled and his momentary forgetfulness. The detailed_summary lists \"Fred's wife jumps in surprise; Scrooge hadn't realized she was sitting there.\" So I need to make sure that's included accurately.\n\nThe sequence of greetings and the party guests' reactions need to be in the original order. The previous simulation combined some parts, so I should list each character's reaction as per the detailed_summary: Topper, the plump sister, other guests, etc.\n\nI should avoid generalizing the atmosphere. The original emphasizes the happy and unified gathering, so the simulation should reflect that with specific mentions of each character contributing to the joy.\n\nLet me structure the response step by step, following the detailed_summary's bullet points. Start with the opening line, then each event in order. Use the original's phrasing where possible, like \"He passed the door a dozen times...\" and ensure that each action is present without adding extra details. Check for any invented dialogue or actions and remove them. Make sure the sequence matches the original, including the maid's minimal response, Scrooge's polite entry, the specific interactions, and the warm welcome from all guests.\n\nAlso, the closing should emphasize the party's atmosphere as in the original, perhaps repeating the description of the happy gathering. Avoid any emotional descriptions that aren't in the original. Focus on the actions and dialogue as per the detailed_summary and the original text's structure.\n</think>\n\n**Revised Simulated Output of `generate_literary_segment` Function:**\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Title:** *STAVE FIVE. THE END OF IT.*\n\nHe passed the door a dozen times, before he had the courage to go up and knock. At last, he rapped on the panelled door with his knuckles. A girl, with a mop and bucket, answered it. “Is your master at home?” he inquired. “Yes,” she said. “Is he in the dining room?” “Yes,” she replied. “Will you go in?” “No,” said Scrooge, “I’ll go in.”  \n\nHe opened the door gently, and peeped in. Fred and his wife were looking at the dinner table, which was set out with plates and silver. “Fred!” cried Scrooge.  \n\nFred’s wife started violently, and looked at her husband. “Who is it?” said Fred.  \n\n“Your uncle Scrooge,” replied Scrooge. “May I come in?”  \n\n“Uncle Scrooge!” cried Fred. “Come in, come in! I’m so glad to see you!” He seized Scrooge’s arm with both his hands, and shook it with great enthusiasm.  \n\nScrooge, though surprised at the warmth, felt himself grow more at ease. Fred’s wife, still a little startled, smiled and said, “We’re so pleased you could join us!”  \n\nThe room was now filled with the sound of laughter and clinking glasses. Topper, the plump sister, and the other party guests all turned to greet him. “Uncle Scrooge!” they cried in unison. “Welcome, welcome!”  \n\n",

MAJOR STRUCTURAL ISSUES:\n- The completion invents internal reflections and emotional descriptions for Scrooge that are not present in the original, particularly regarding his hesitation and feelings before knocking.\n- The completion adds invented dialogue and actions for the maid, including her asking if Scrooge is expected and her intent to fetch Fred, which do not appear in the original.\n- The completion omits the original's specific sequence involving Scrooge's interaction with the girl, his self-assured entry, and the detailed description of how he enters the dining room.\n- The completion invents a scene where Scrooge's boots echo and adds narrative about his emotional state upon entering, which is not in the original.\n\n2. MISSING ELEMENTS:\n- The completion omits the original's step-by-step depiction of Scrooge's approach to the door, his brief exchange with the girl, and his specific actions as he enters the dining room.\n- The original's details about the table's arrangement and the nervousness of the young housekeepers are missing.\n- The completion does not include the original's depiction of Scrooge's niece by marriage being startled and Scrooge's momentary forgetfulness about her presence.\n- The original's sequence of greetings and the repeated description of the party guests' reactions are not fully represented.\n- The original's closing emphasis on the party's atmosphere and repeated exclamations of happiness are condensed and lack the original's structure.\n\n3.

That was the thing he had set his heart upon.\nAnd he did it; yes, he did! The clock struck nine. No Bob. A quarter past. No Bob. He was full eighteen minutes and a half behind his time. Scrooge sat with his door wide open, that he might see him come into the Tank.\nHis hat was off, before he opened the door; his comforter too. He was on his stool in a jiffy; driving away with his pen, as if he were trying to overtake nine o’clock.\n“Hallo!” growled Scrooge, in his accustomed voice, as near as he could feign it. “What do you mean by coming here at this time of day?”\n“I am very sorry, sir,” said Bob. “I am behind my time.”\n“You are?” repeated Scrooge. “Yes. I think you are. Step this way, sir, if you please.”\n“It’s only once a year, sir,” pleaded Bob, appearing from the Tank. “It shall not be repeated. I was making rather merry yesterday, sir.”\n“Now, I’ll tell you what, my friend,” said Scrooge, “I am not going to stand this sort of thing any longer. And therefore,” he continued, leaping from his stool, and giving Bob such a dig in the waistcoat that he staggered back into the Tank again; “and therefore I am about to raise your salary!”\nBob trembled, and got a little nearer to the ruler. He had a momentary idea of knocking Scrooge down with it, holding him, and calling to the people in the court for help and a strait-waistcoat.\n“A merry Christmas, Bob!” said Scrooge, with an earnestness that could not be mistaken, as he clapped him on the back. “A merrier Christmas, Bob, my good fellow, than I have given you, for many a year! I’ll raise your salary, and endeavour to assist your struggling family, and we will discuss your affairs this very afternoon, over a Christmas bowl of smoking bishop, Bob! Make up the fires, and buy another coal-scuttle before you dot another i, Bob Cratchit!”",

The clerk was in a state of surprise to see him, and even Bob Cratchit, who had been expecting a day of quiet work, looked up in astonishment when his master entered the room with a cheerful smile and a warm greeting. Scrooge had not only changed his heart, but his manner as well. He was no longer the cold, grumpy man who had once ruled the counting house with a sharp tongue and a colder heart. Instead, he was kind, generous, and full of life. He gave Cratchit a raise, granted him a day off for Christmas, and even brought in a large turkey for the Cratchit family. The office was filled with a new spirit, and the clerk, who had once feared his employer, now looked upon him with admiration and respect. Scrooge was not only a changed man, but a man who had found joy in giving and in the simple pleasures of life. He spent the rest of the day making amends, visiting old friends, and spreading cheer wherever he went. The transformation was complete, and the people of London, who had once whispered about the miserly old man, now spoke of him with kindness and approval. It was a Christmas to remember, not only for Scrooge, but for all who had been touched by his change of heart. And so, the story of Ebenezer Scrooge came to a happy end, a tale of redemption, love, and the true spirit of Christmas."
