These apples were always counted, and about the time when they began to grow ripe it was found that every night one of them was gone. The king became very angry at this, and ordered the gardener to keep watch all night under the tree. The gardener set his eldest son to watch; but about twelve o’clock he fell asleep, and in the morning another of the apples was missing. Then the second son was ordered to watch; and at midnight he too fell asleep, and in the morning another apple was gone. Then the third son offered to keep watch; but the gardener at first would not let him, for fear some harm should come to him: however, at last he consented, and the young man laid himself under the tree to watch. As the clock struck twelve he heard a rustling noise in the air, and a bird came flying that was of pure gold; and as it was snapping at one of the apples with its beak, the gardener’s son jumped up and shot an arrow at it. But the arrow did the bird no harm; only it dropped a golden feather from its tail, and then flew away. The golden feather was brought to the king in the morning, and all the council was called together. Everyone agreed that it was worth more than all the wealth of the kingdom: but the king said, ‘One feather is of no use to me, I must have the whole bird.’",

These apples were regularly counted, and around the time they were ready to be picked, it was noticed that one vanished each night. This greatly angered the king, who instructed his gardener to stand guard under the tree overnight. The gardener assigned his oldest son to the task, but around midnight, the son dozed off, and by morning, another apple was gone. Next, the second son was ordered to watch; he also fell asleep at midnight, and come morning, yet another apple had disappeared. Then the third son offered to keep watch, but the gardener initially hesitated, worried that his son might be harmed. Eventually, he agreed, and the young man positioned himself beneath the tree for the watch. As the clock struck midnight, he heard a faint rustling sound in the air, and a bird made entirely of pure gold flew in. Just as it was pecking at one of the apples with its beak, the gardener’s son leaped up and fired an arrow at it. However, the arrow didn't injure the bird; it merely caused a golden feather to fall from its tail before it flew away. The next morning, the golden feather was presented to the king, and his entire council was summoned. Everyone agreed that the feather was worth more than all the wealth in the kingdom combined, but the king declared, 'A single feather is useless to me; I must have the whole bird.'",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "Once upon a time, there was a king who had a splendid garden. In this garden grew a tree that produced golden apples, and these apples were carefully counted. As they started to ripen, it was discovered that one apple would disappear each night. This made the king furious, so he told the gardener to keep watch under the tree through the night. The gardener had his eldest son stand guard, but he fell asleep around midnight, and by morning, another apple was missing. The second son then took his turn, but he too dozed off at midnight, and a further apple vanished by dawn. The youngest son then volunteered to keep watch, though his father was reluctant because he was worried something might happen to him. Eventually, the gardener agreed, and the youngest son lay in wait beneath the tree. At midnight, he heard a soft noise in the air, and saw a bird made entirely of gold arrive and try to peck at an apple. The gardener’s son quickly shot an arrow at it, but it didn’t hurt the bird; instead, a single golden feather fell from its tail before it flew away. The following morning, the golden feather was shown to the king, who consulted with his advisors. They all agreed that the feather was more valuable than anything else in the kingdom, but the king declared, “A feather alone is not enough; I must have the entire bird.”"

Then he went his way, and in the evening came to the village where the two inns were; and in one of these were people singing, and dancing, and feasting; but the other looked very dirty, and poor. ‘I should be very silly,’ said he, ‘if I went to that shabby house, and left this charming place’; so he went into the smart house, and ate and drank at his ease, and forgot the bird, and his country too.\nTime passed on; and as the eldest son did not come back, and no tidings were heard of him, the second son set out, and the same thing happened to him.

It advised him that upon reaching a village that evening, he would find two inns facing each other.

The world may very likely not always think of them as they think of themselves, but what care they for the world? what can it know about the matter?\nOne of these lucky beings was neighbour Hans. Seven long years he had worked hard for his master. At last he said, ‘Master, my time is up; I must go home and see my poor mother once more: so pray pay me my wages and let me go.’ And the master said, ‘You have been a faithful and good servant, Hans, so your pay shall be handsome.’ Then he gave him a lump of silver as big as his head.\nHans took out his pocket-handkerchief, put the piece of silver into it, threw it over his shoulder, and jogged off on his road homewards. As he went lazily on, dragging one foot after another, a man came in sight, trotting gaily along on a capital horse. ‘Ah!’ said Hans aloud, ‘what a fine thing it is to ride on horseback! There he sits as easy and happy as if he was at home, in the chair by his fireside; he trips against no stones, saves shoe-leather, and gets on he hardly knows how.’ Hans did not speak so softly but the horseman heard it all, and said, ‘Well, friend, why do you go on foot then?’ ‘Ah!’ said he, ‘I have this load to carry: to be sure it is silver, but it is so heavy that I can’t hold up my head, and you must know it hurts my shoulder sadly.’ ‘What do you say of making an exchange?’ said the horseman. ‘I will give you my horse, and you shall give me the silver; which will save you a great deal of trouble in carrying such a heavy load about with you.’ ‘With all my heart,’ said Hans: ‘but as you are so kind to me, I must tell you one thing—you will have a weary task to draw that silver about with you.’ However, the horseman got off, took the silver, helped Hans up, gave him the bridle into one hand and the whip into the other, and said, ‘When you want to go very fast, smack your lips loudly together, and cry “Jip!”’",

No matter how they are challenged, they will always land safely, like a cat, and simply move forward more quickly. The world might not always see them as favorably as they see themselves, but they are unconcerned with global opinion; what insight could others possibly have into their circumstances?\n\nOne such fortunate individual was their neighbor, Hans. After working diligently for his employer for seven full years, he eventually stated, 'Master, my contracted time is finished; I must return home to see my poor mother one last time. Please pay me my wages and allow me to depart.' His master replied, 'Hans, you have been a loyal and excellent servant, so your payment will be generous.' With that, he presented Hans with a lump of silver as large as his own head.\n\nHans retrieved his handkerchief, placed the silver chunk inside, slung it over his shoulder, and set off toward his home. As he walked along at a relaxed pace, shuffling his feet, he saw a man approaching, riding cheerfully on an excellent horse. 'Oh!' Hans exclaimed to himself, 'how wonderful it must be to travel on horseback! He looks completely comfortable and content, as if he were sitting in his favorite chair by the fireplace at home. He avoids stumbling over rocks, saves wear and tear on his shoes, and progresses effortlessly.' Hans's words were loud enough for the rider to hear, and the man asked, 'Well, friend, why are you walking then?' 'Ah!' he replied, 'I am burdened by this load; it is silver, of course, but it is so weighty that I can scarcely lift my head, and it is truly causing pain to my shoulder.' The horseman proposed, 'How about we make a trade? I will give you my horse, and you can give me the silver. This way, you'll avoid the great difficulty of carrying such a heavy load.' Hans responded, 'With pleasure! But since you are being so kind, I must warn you about one thing—you will find it a tiresome task to haul that silver around.' Nonetheless, the horseman dismounted, took the silver, helped Hans climb onto the horse, placed the reins in one hand and the whip in the other, and instructed, 'When you wish to go very fast, make a loud smacking sound with your lips and shout \"Jip!\"'",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "Some people seem naturally lucky: everything they attempt succeeds, fortune favors them at every turn, and they always manage to land on their feet and move forward, no matter how unpredictable life gets. Even if others don’t see them quite as favorably as they see themselves, these lucky ones don’t really care what the world thinks. One such fortunate soul was Hans, who had spent seven years working diligently for his master. When his time was over, Hans asked for his wages so that he could return home to his mother. His master, recognizing Hans’s faithful service, rewarded him with a large piece of silver, as big as Hans’s head. Hans wrapped the silver in his handkerchief, slung it over his shoulder, and began his journey home. As he trudged along, he saw a cheerful man riding a fine horse and envied how comfortable and easy the rider looked. Hans wished aloud for such a ride, and the horseman, overhearing him, suggested they trade: Hans could have the horse in exchange for the heavy silver. Hans gladly agreed, warning the rider that the silver would be a burden to carry. The horseman accepted, handed Hans the bridle and whip, and explained how to make the horse go faster by making a noise and calling “Jip!”"

When he had rested himself he set off again, driving his cow towards his mother’s village. But the heat grew greater as soon as noon came on, till at last, as he found himself on a wide heath that would take him more than an hour to cross, he began to be so hot and parched that his tongue clave to the roof of his mouth. ‘I can find a cure for this,’ thought he; ‘now I will milk my cow and quench my thirst’: so he tied her to the stump of a tree, and held his leathern cap to milk into; but not a drop was to be had. Who would have thought that this cow, which was to bring him milk and butter and cheese, was all that time utterly dry? Hans had not thought of looking to that.\nWhile he was trying his luck in milking, and managing the matter very clumsily, the uneasy beast began to think him very troublesome; and at last gave him such a kick on the head as knocked him down; and there he lay a long while senseless. Luckily a butcher soon came by, driving a pig in a wheelbarrow. ‘What is the matter with you, my man?’ said the butcher, as he helped him up. Hans told him what had happened, how he was dry, and wanted to milk his cow, but found the cow was dry too. Then the butcher gave him a flask of ale, saying, ‘There, drink and refresh yourself; your cow will give you no milk: don’t you see she is an old beast, good for nothing but the slaughter-house?’ ‘Alas, alas!’ said Hans, ‘who would have thought it? What a shame to take my horse, and give me only a dry cow! If I kill her, what will she be good for? I hate cow-beef; it is not tender enough for me. If it were a pig now—like that fat gentleman you are driving along at his ease—one could do something with it; it would at any rate make sausages.’ ‘Well,’ said the butcher, ‘I don’t like to say no, when one is asked to do a kind, neighbourly thing. To please you I will change, and give you my fine fat pig for the cow.’ ‘Heaven reward you for your kindness and self-denial!’ said Hans, as he gave the butcher the cow; and taking the pig off the wheel-barrow, drove it away, holding it by the string that was tied to its leg.\nSo on he jogged, and all seemed now to go right with him: he had met with some misfortunes, to be sure; but he was now well repaid for all.

What more could anyone desire?' Upon reaching an inn, he stopped, consumed all his bread, and spent his last coin on a glass of beer. After resting, he resumed his journey, leading the cow towards his mother's village. However, the heat intensified significantly as noon approached. Eventually, finding himself on a vast, exposed heath that would take over an hour to cross, he became so hot and dehydrated that his tongue stuck to the roof of his mouth. 'I know how to fix this,' he thought. 'Now I'll milk my cow and quench my thirst.' He tied her to a tree stump and held out his leather cap to milk into, but not a single drop came out. Who would have guessed that this cow, expected to provide him with milk, butter, and cheese, was completely dry? Hans hadn't considered checking that. While he was awkwardly attempting to milk the cow, the restless animal found him bothersome and eventually delivered a kick to his head that knocked him down, leaving him unconscious for a considerable time.

'Oh dear, oh dear!' exclaimed Hans. 'Who would have thought it? It's terrible that they took my horse and only gave me a dry cow! If I slaughter her, what good will she be? I dislike cow meat; it's too tough for me. Now, if it were a pig—like that plump fellow you're comfortably transporting—one could do something with it; it would at least make sausages.' 'Well,' replied the butcher, 'I find it hard to refuse when asked to do a kind, neighborly deed. To help you out, I'll trade; I'll give you my fine fat pig for the cow.' 'May Heaven reward you for your kindness and generosity!' said Hans, as he handed the cow to the butcher. Taking the pig from the wheelbarrow, he led it away by the string tied to its leg. So he ambled along, feeling that everything was now going right. He had certainly faced some setbacks, but he felt fully compensated for them all. How could it be otherwise with the excellent travel companion he had finally acquired?",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "Hans dusted off his coat, cleaned his face and hands, took a break, and then gently led his cow away, feeling that he had made a great deal. 'As long as I have even a piece of bread—which I’ll always find—I can enjoy butter and cheese with it. And if I get thirsty, I can simply milk my cow and drink the milk. What more could I want?' When he reached an inn, he stopped, finished his bread, and spent his last coin on a glass of beer. After resting, he continued on with the cow towards his mother’s village. As noon approached and the sun grew hotter, he found himself crossing a wide field, feeling so thirsty his mouth was dry. 'I have a solution for this,' he thought, 'I'll just milk my cow.' He tied the cow to a tree stump and tried to milk into his cap, but not a single drop came out. Hans hadn’t considered that the cow might not give any milk. While clumsily attempting to milk her, the irritated cow became annoyed and eventually kicked him hard on the head, knocking him unconscious. He lay there for a long time until a butcher passed by, pushing a pig in a wheelbarrow. 'What happened?' asked the butcher as he helped Hans up. Hans explained that he was thirsty and had tried to milk his cow, but she was dry. The butcher handed him some ale and said, 'Drink this; your cow can’t be milked. She’s old and only good for slaughter.' 'Oh dear!' Hans cried, 'What a shame that my horse was swapped for a cow that gives no milk! If I butcher her, it won’t even taste good—I don’t like tough beef. If only I had a pig, like yours, at least I could make sausages!' 'Well,' replied the butcher, 'since you’ve asked nicely, I’ll trade my plump pig for your cow.' 'Thank you for your kindness!' Hans exclaimed, and exchanged his cow for the pig, which he then led away with a string. Hans set off, feeling things were finally looking up despite his misfortunes, now that he had such a wonderful travelling companion."

Whoever roasts and eats it will find plenty of fat upon it, it has lived so well!’ ‘You’re right,’ said Hans, as he weighed it in his hand; ‘but if you talk of fat, my pig is no trifle.’ Meantime the countryman began to look grave, and shook his head. ‘Hark ye!’ said he, ‘my worthy friend, you seem a good sort of fellow, so I can’t help doing you a kind turn. Your pig may get you into a scrape. In the village I just came from, the squire has had a pig stolen out of his sty. I was dreadfully afraid when I saw you that you had got the squire’s pig. If you have, and they catch you, it will be a bad job for you. The least they will do will be to throw you into the horse-pond.

I know nothing of where the pig was either bred or born; but he may have been the squire’s for aught I can tell: you know this country better than I do, take my pig and give me the goose.’ ‘I ought to have something into the bargain,’ said the countryman; ‘give a fat goose for a pig, indeed! ‘Tis not everyone would do so much for you as that. However, I will not be hard upon you, as you are in trouble.’ Then he took the string in his hand, and drove off the pig by a side path; while Hans went on the way homewards free from care. ‘After all,’ thought he, ‘that chap is pretty well taken in. I don’t care whose pig it is, but wherever it came from it has been a very good friend to me. I have much the best of the bargain. First there will be a capital roast; then the fat will find me in goose-grease for six months; and then there are all the beautiful white feathers.

The farmer then began to share his own story, saying he was taking the goose to a baptism celebration. 'Feel,' he said, 'how heavy it is, even though it's only two months old. Anyone who roasts and eats it will find lots of fat on it, it's lived so well!' 'You're right,' Hans agreed, weighing it in his hand; 'but if you're talking about fat, my pig is quite substantial.' Meanwhile, the farmer started to look serious and shook his head. 'Listen,' he advised, 'my good friend, you seem like an honest person, so I feel I must help you. Your pig could land you in trouble. In the village I just left, the landlord has had a pig stolen from his sty. I was terribly worried when I saw you that you had the landlord's pig. If you do, and they catch you, it will go badly for you. At the very least, they'll throw you in the horse pond. Can you swim?' Poor Hans was terribly scared. 'Kind sir,' he cried, 'please help me out of this mess. I know nothing about the pig's origin, but for all I know, it might belong to the landlord. You know this region better than I do; take my pig and give me the goose.' 'I really should get something more in the bargain,' said the farmer; 'giving a fat goose for a pig, indeed! Not everyone would do that much for you. However, I won't be tough on you, since you are in difficulty.' Then he took the string in his hand and led the pig away down a side path, while Hans continued on his way home, free from worry. 'After all,' he thought, 'that fellow was pretty easily fooled. I don't care whose pig it is, but wherever it came from, it was a very good friend to me. I definitely got the better deal. First, there will be an excellent roast; then the fat will provide me with goose grease for six months; and then there are all the lovely white feathers.

The countryman shared in return that he was taking the goose to a christening, and invited Hans to feel how heavy and well-fed the young goose was. Hans agreed it was impressive, but boasted that his pig was just as substantial. Suddenly, the countryman looked concerned and told Hans that in the nearby village, a pig had just been stolen from the squire, and he worried that Hans’s pig might be the stolen one. He warned Hans that if this were true and Hans was caught, the consequences would be severe, perhaps even being tossed into a horse pond. Frightened, Hans begged the countryman for help and offered to exchange his pig for the goose, admitting he didn't know where the pig was from. The countryman feigned reluctance but agreed to the swap, graciously taking the pig and leaving Hans with the goose. As Hans continued homewards, he felt relieved and lucky, thinking he had the better deal: a delicious roast, goose fat to last for months, and soft feathers for his pillow.

Jorindel cautioned her, saying, 'We must be careful not to get too close to the fairy's castle.' The evening was lovely; the final rays of the setting sun cast a bright glow through the tall trees onto the green plants below, and turtle-doves cooed from the high birch branches. Jorinda paused to watch the sun go down, with Jorindel beside her. Both experienced an unexplainable sadness, feeling as if they were destined never to see each other again. They had wandered quite far, and when they tried to figure out the route home, they realized they didn't know which way to go.",

This frightened him dreadfully, and away he ran to the back door; but there the dog jumped up and bit him in the leg; and as he was crossing over the yard the ass kicked him; and the cock, who had been awakened by the noise, crowed with all his might. At this the robber ran back as fast as he could to his comrades, and told the captain how a horrid witch had got into the house, and had spat at him and scratched his face with her long bony fingers; how a man with a knife in his hand had hidden himself behind the door, and stabbed him in the leg; how a black monster stood in the yard and struck him with a club, and how the devil had sat upon the top of the house and cried out, ‘Throw the rascal up here!’ After this the robbers never dared to go back to the house; but the musicians were so pleased with their quarters that they took up their abode there; and there they are, I dare say, at this very day.",

One member, braver than the others, went to investigate. Finding stillness, he entered the kitchen and fumbled around for a match to light a candle. When he spotted the cat's shiny, glowing eyes, he mistook them for hot coals and tried to light his match on them. The cat, not amused by this action, pounced on his face, spitting and scratching him. Terrified, he fled towards the back door, where the dog leaped up and bit his leg. As he crossed the yard, the donkey kicked him, and the rooster, roused by the commotion, crowed loudly. The robber raced back to his companions as fast as he could, telling the captain that a horrible witch was inside the house, who had spat on him and clawed his face with her long, bony fingers. He claimed a man with a knife had hidden behind the door and stabbed his leg, a dark monster was in the yard that hit him with a club, and the devil himself sat on the roof shouting, 'Throw the villain up here!' After this, the robbers never dared to return to the house.

Spotting the cat’s glowing eyes in the dark, he mistook them for embers and tried to light his match with them. The cat, startled and annoyed, leapt at his face, hissing and scratching him. Terrified, the robber dashed for the back door, only to be bitten on the leg by the dog. As he hurried through the yard, the donkey kicked him, and when the noise awoke the rooster, it crowed loudly. The panicked robber ran back to his companions and told the leader that he had encountered a terrifying witch who scratched his face, a knife-wielding man who stabbed his leg, a large black creature in the yard that hit him with a club, and even the devil atop the roof shouting to toss him up. After this incident, the robbers never dared return. Meanwhile, the animal musicians enjoyed the house so much that they settled there, and so, as the tale goes, they may still live there today."

In the end, however, they caught her: and the wife said, ‘Shall I kill her at once?’ ‘No,’ cried he, ‘that is letting her off too easily: she shall die a much more cruel death; I will eat her.’ But the sparrow began to flutter about, and stretch out her neck and cried, ‘Carter! it shall cost thee thy life yet!’ With that he could wait no longer: so he gave his wife the hatchet, and cried, ‘Wife, strike at the bird and kill her in my hand.’ And the wife struck; but she missed her aim, and hit her husband on the head so that he fell down dead, and the sparrow flew quietly home to her nest.",

Enraged, the carter sprang up, grabbed his axe, and hurled it at the bird, but missed, shattering only the window. The sparrow then hopped inside, alighted on the windowsill, and reiterated, 'Carter! Your life is forfeit!' Driven insane by fury, he struck the windowsill with such might that he split it in two. As the sparrow flitted from spot to spot, the carter and his wife, in their blind rage, demolished all their furnishings—glassware, chairs, benches, the table, and ultimately even the walls—in their futile attempts to strike the bird. Eventually, however, they managed to capture it. The wife asked, 'Shall I kill it right away?' 'No,' he roared, 'that would be too easy a demise. It must suffer a far crueler death; I will devour it.' Yet the sparrow began to quiver, extending its neck, and cried, 'Carter! Your life will still be taken!' Unable to wait any longer, he handed the axe to his wife and commanded, 'Wife, strike the bird and kill it while I hold it in my hand.' The wife swung the axe but missed her target, striking her husband on the head instead. He collapsed, dead, and the sparrow calmly flew back to its home.",

The soldier snapped off a branch from each grove, and each time he did, a loud sound echoed, frightening the youngest sister; the eldest, however, reassured her, claiming it was just the princes expressing their happiness. Eventually, they reached a large lake, beside which stood twelve small boats, each with a handsome prince inside, apparently waiting for the princesses. Each princess boarded a boat, with the soldier getting into the same one as the youngest sister. As they crossed the lake, the prince accompanying them remarked that even though he was rowing as hard as he could, the boat wasn't moving as quickly as usual and felt unusually heavy. The princess replied that it was probably just the hot weather, as she felt quite warm too."

When he reached the sea, it appeared dark blue and somber, even though it was very calm. He approached the water's edge and spoke: 'Oh, man of the sea! Listen to me! My wife, Ilsabill, insists on having her way, and has sent me to request a favor from you!' 'Alright, what does she desire now?' asked the fish. 'Oh,' the man replied sadly, 'my wife wants to live in a stone castle.' 'Then go home,' said the fish, 'she is already standing at its gate.' So the fisherman returned and discovered his wife standing before the entrance of a grand castle. 'Look,' she said, 'isn't this magnificent?' With that, they entered the castle together. Inside, they found many servants, and the rooms were all richly furnished, filled with chairs and tables made of gold. Behind the castle was a garden, and surrounding it was a park measuring half a mile in length, populated with sheep, goats, hares, and deer. In the courtyard were stables and cow-houses. 'Well,' the man said, 'now we will live cheerfully and happily in this beautiful castle for the remainder of our lives.' 'Perhaps we will,' the wife replied, 'but let's consider it overnight before we make a final decision.' Thus, they went to bed.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "Things went well for a couple of weeks, but then Dame Ilsabill said, 'Husband, this cottage is too small for us; the yard and garden are much too little. I want to live in a grand stone castle. Go ask the fish to give us one.' The fisherman replied, 'Wife, I hesitate to bother him again. He might be annoyed; we should be satisfied with this lovely cottage.' 'Nonsense!' Dame Ilsabill insisted. 'He'll grant your request, I'm sure; now go and ask!' Although the fisherman went, he felt very unhappy. When he arrived at the sea, it looked deep blue and gloomy, though it was still. He walked up to the edge of the water and called:\n\n 'O man of the sea!\n Hear me!\n My wife Ilsabill\n Always wants her will,\n And has sent me to request another favor from you!'\n\n'What does she want this time?' the fish asked. 'Alas!' the fisherman sighed, 'my wife wishes to live in a stone castle.' 'Go home,' said the fish. 'She is already at the castle gates.' The fisherman hurried home and found his wife standing at the entrance of a magnificent castle. 'See,' she said, 'isn’t this splendid?' They went inside together and discovered numerous servants and beautifully decorated rooms overflowing with golden chairs and tables. Behind the castle was a garden, and all around was a park half a mile wide, full of sheep, goats, hares, and deer; and in the courtyard were stables and cowsheds. 'Well,' said the fisherman, 'now we can live happily and contentedly in this wonderful castle as long as we live.' 'Maybe so,' his wife replied; 'but let's sleep on it before we decide.' So they went to bed."

My wife Ilsabill is set on having her way, and has sent me to ask a favor of you!' The fish asked, 'What does she want now?' The fisherman replied, 'Ah, she wishes to control the sun and moon.' 'Go back home,' the fish said, 'return to your humble pigsty.' And there they have remained ever since.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "The fisherman returned home and saw his wife, Ilsabill, seated on an enormous throne two miles high, wearing three large crowns on her head. She was surrounded by the full splendor and authority of the Church. On either side of her, there were two rows of burning lights of varying sizes—the biggest as tall as the tallest tower in the world, the smallest no larger than a tiny night light. The fisherman, amazed at this scene, asked, 'Wife, are you pope now?' 'Yes,' she replied. 'Well,' he said, 'being pope is a tremendous thing. Surely now you can be content, as nothing is greater.' She answered, 'I'll consider it.' That night, they went to bed, but Ilsabill couldn't sleep, restless with thoughts of what more she could become. As dawn arrived, she noticed the sun rising through the window and thought angrily, 'I cannot stop the sun from rising.' This made her so upset that she woke her husband and insisted he go to the fish and ask to make her ruler of the sun and moon. The fisherman, frightened by her desire, jumped out of bed and pleaded, 'Wife, can't you just be satisfied with being pope?' 'No,' she said, 'I'm discontent as long as the sun and moon rise without my permission. Go to the fish!' Terrified, the man made his way to the shore amid a violent storm—trees and rocks trembling, the sky darkening with clouds, lightning flashing, thunder rumbling, and giant black waves rising from the sea. The fisherman approached the sea and called out:\n\n'O man of the sea!\nListen to me!\nMy wife Ilsabill\nHas her strong will,\nAnd has sent me to ask a favor of thee!'\n\nThe fish asked, 'What does she want now?' The fisherman answered, 'She wishes to rule over the sun and the moon.' The fish replied, 'Go home, back to your pigsty.'\n\nAnd so, the fisherman and his wife lived there ever after."

And she gave her a waiting-maid to ride with her, and give her into the bridegroom’s hands; and each had a horse for the journey. Now the princess’s horse was the fairy’s gift, and it was called Falada, and could speak.\nWhen the time came for them to set out, the fairy went into her bed-chamber, and took a little knife, and cut off a lock of her hair, and gave it to the princess, and said, ‘Take care of it, dear child; for it is a charm that may be of use to you on the road.’ Then they all took a sorrowful leave of the princess; and she put the lock of hair into her bosom, got upon her horse, and set off on her journey to her bridegroom’s kingdom.",

A benevolent fairy also held affection for the princess and assisted her mother in watching over her. When the princess reached adulthood, she was promised in marriage to a prince who resided far off. As the wedding date drew near, she made ready to embark on her trip to his land. The queen, her mother, packed a considerable amount of expensive items, including jewels, gold, silver, decorative objects, and beautiful garments – everything appropriate for a royal bride. She also assigned a lady-in-waiting to accompany her, tasked with presenting her to the groom, and provided a horse for each of them for the journey. The princess's horse, called Falada, was a gift from the fairy and possessed the ability to speak. When it was time for them to depart, the fairy entered the princess's room, took a small knife, cut off a piece of her hair, and gave it to the princess, instructing her to keep it safe as it was a magical protection that might be useful on the road. After a sorrowful farewell from everyone, the princess placed the lock of hair in her bodice, mounted her horse, and set off on her journey toward her betrothed's kingdom.",

She assigned a maid to accompany the princess and deliver her safely to the prince, and both were given horses. The princess’s horse was a magical gift from the fairy, named Falada, who could talk. Before the journey, the fairy visited the princess’s room, cut a small lock of her hair, and handed it to her, saying, ‘Keep this safe, my dear; it is a charm that may help you on your way.’ Tearful farewells followed, and the princess tucked the lock of hair into her dress, mounted her horse, and began her journey to her future husband’s land."

Over hills, valleys, and stones, away it shall be whirled until my silvery locks are fully combed and styled!' The wind came again, blowing his hat a great distance over the hills and far away, forcing him to run after it once more.

When she reached the meadow, she sat on a grassy bank and let down her long, shining silver hair.

Make him chase after that! Over hills and stones, let it be twirled, Till every lock is combed and curled!” A strong breeze then blew Curdken’s hat away, forcing him to chase it over the hills.

Now, whether it was that they had eaten so many nuts that they could not walk, or whether they were lazy and would not, I do not know: however, they took it into their heads that it did not become them to go home on foot. So Chanticleer began to build a little carriage of nutshells: and when it was finished, Partlet jumped into it and sat down, and bid Chanticleer harness himself to it and draw her home. ‘That’s a good joke!’ said Chanticleer; ‘no, that will never do; I had rather by half walk home; I’ll sit on the box and be coachman, if you like, but I’ll not draw.’ While this was passing, a duck came quacking up and cried out, ‘You thieving vagabonds, what business have you in my grounds? I’ll give it you well for your insolence!’ and upon that she fell upon Chanticleer most lustily.

But Chanticleer was not afraid and fought back fiercely with his sharp spurs, hitting the duck so hard that she quickly started begging for mercy. He only spared her life on the condition that she agree to pull the carriage home for them. She accepted the deal.

When it was ready, Partlet climbed in and suggested that Chanticleer should pull her home. \"What a funny idea!\" said Chanticleer. \"I’d much rather walk. If you want, I’ll sit up front and be the driver, but I won’t pull.\" As they were discussing this, a duck suddenly approached, scolding them for being on her land and promising to teach them a lesson. She attacked Chanticleer with great energy, but he bravely fought back with his sharp spurs. Eventually, the duck pleaded for mercy, which was granted only if she agreed to pull their carriage home. The duck consented, so Chanticleer climbed onto the seat and urged her to hurry, and off they all went at a good speed."

It was, however, surrounded by a high wall, and no one dared to go into it because it belonged to an enchantress, who had great power and was dreaded by all the world. One day the woman was standing by this window and looking down into the garden, when she saw a bed which was planted with the most beautiful rampion (rapunzel), and it looked so fresh and green that she longed for it, she quite pined away, and began to look pale and miserable. Then her husband was alarmed, and asked: ‘What ails you, dear wife?’ ‘Ah,’ she replied, ‘if I can’t eat some of the rampion, which is in the garden behind our house, I shall die.’ The man, who loved her, thought: ‘Sooner than let your wife die, bring her some of the rampion yourself, let it cost what it will.’ At twilight, he clambered down over the wall into the garden of the enchantress, hastily clutched a handful of rampion, and took it to his wife. She at once made herself a salad of it, and ate it greedily. It tasted so good to her—so very good, that the next day she longed for it three times as much as before. If he was to have any rest, her husband must once more descend into the garden. In the gloom of evening therefore, he let himself down again; but when he had clambered down the wall he was terribly afraid, for he saw the enchantress standing before him. ‘How can you dare,’ said she with angry look, ‘descend into my garden and steal my rampion like a thief? You shall suffer for it!’ ‘Ah,’ answered he, ‘let mercy take the place of justice, I only made up my mind to do it out of necessity. My wife saw your rampion from the window, and felt such a longing for it that she would have died if she had not got some to eat.’ Then the enchantress allowed her anger to be softened, and said to him: ‘If the case be as you say, I will allow you to take away with you as much rampion as you will, only I make one condition, you must give me the child which your wife will bring into the world; it shall be well treated, and I will care for it like a mother.’ The man in his terror consented to everything, and when the woman was brought to bed, the enchantress appeared at once, gave the child the name of Rapunzel, and took it away with her.",

She replied that she would die if she couldn't eat some of the rampion from the garden behind their house. Her loving husband, determined not to let her die, decided he would get some for her, no matter the cost. As dusk fell, he climbed over the wall into the enchantress's garden, quickly grabbed a handful of rampion, and brought it to his wife. She immediately prepared a salad with it and ate it ravenously. It tasted so incredibly good that the following day her desire for it was three times stronger. To bring his wife peace, her husband knew he had to return to the garden. So, in the evening twilight, he lowered himself down again. However, as he reached the ground, he was terrified to see the enchantress standing right there. Angrily, she demanded, 'How dare you sneak into my garden like a thief and steal my rampion? You will face punishment for this!' He pleaded, 'Please be merciful instead of just. I only did this because I had to. My wife saw your rampion from the window and wanted it so badly that she would have died without it.' The enchantress's anger lessened upon hearing his explanation. She told him, 'If what you say is true, I will let you take as much rampion as you want, but only under one condition: you must give me the child your wife is expecting.

In order to give his wife peace, the husband once again entered the garden at night, but this time he was caught by the enchantress. She confronted him angrily, accusing him of stealing her rampion.

Then came a peasant woman down the street crying: ‘Good jams, cheap! Good jams, cheap!’ This rang pleasantly in the tailor’s ears; he stretched his delicate head out of the window, and called: ‘Come up here, dear woman; here you will get rid of your goods.’ The woman came up the three steps to the tailor with her heavy basket, and he made her unpack all the pots for him. He inspected each one, lifted it up, put his nose to it, and at length said: ‘The jam seems to me to be good, so weigh me out four ounces, dear woman, and if it is a quarter of a pound that is of no consequence.’ The woman who had hoped to find a good sale, gave him what he desired, but went away quite angry and grumbling. ‘Now, this jam shall be blessed by God,’ cried the little tailor, ‘and give me health and strength’; so he brought the bread out of the cupboard, cut himself a piece right across the loaf and spread the jam over it. ‘This won’t taste bitter,’ said he, ‘but I will just finish the jacket before I take a bite.’ He laid the bread near him, sewed on, and in his joy, made bigger and bigger stitches. In the meantime the smell of the sweet jam rose to where the flies were sitting in great numbers, and they were attracted and descended on it in hosts. ‘Hi! who invited you?’ said the little tailor, and drove the unbidden guests away. The flies, however, who understood no German, would not be turned away, but came back again in ever-increasing companies. The little tailor at last lost all patience, and drew a piece of cloth from the hole under his work-table, and saying: ‘Wait, and I will give it to you,’ struck it mercilessly on them. When he drew it away and counted, there lay before him no fewer than seven, dead and with legs stretched out. ‘Are you a fellow of that sort?’ said he, and could not help admiring his own bravery. ‘The whole town shall know of this!’ And the little tailor hastened to cut himself a girdle, stitched it, and embroidered on it in large letters: ‘Seven at one stroke!’ ‘What, the town!’ he continued, ‘the whole world shall hear of it!’ and his heart wagged with joy like a lamb’s tail.",

A peasant woman walked down the street, calling out, 'Good quality jam, sold cheaply!' The sound was pleasant to the tailor, who leaned his delicate head out the window and called, 'Come up, good woman; you can sell your wares here.' The woman climbed the three steps to the tailor with her heavy basket, and he asked her to show him all her pots. He examined each one, lifting it and sniffing it. Finally, he said, 'The jam seems fine to me, so weigh out four ounces for me, my dear, and don't worry if it's a quarter of a pound.' The woman, who had hoped for a larger sale, gave him the amount he wanted but left quite annoyed and muttering to herself. The little tailor declared, 'May God bless this jam and give me health and strength!' He took bread from his cupboard, cut a thick slice from the loaf, and spread the jam on it. 'This will taste good,' he said, 'but I'll finish this jacket before I take a bite.' He placed the bread nearby and continued sewing, taking larger and larger stitches in his happiness. Meanwhile, the sweet smell of the jam attracted a large swarm of flies, which descended upon it in great numbers. 'Hey! Who invited you?' the little tailor exclaimed, shooing away the unwelcome visitors. However, the flies, not understanding German, refused to leave and returned in ever-increasing groups. The little tailor eventually lost his patience, pulled a piece of cloth from beneath his worktable, and saying, 'Just wait, I'll deal with you,' he struck the flies without mercy. When he lifted the cloth and counted, he saw at least seven flies lying dead with their legs stretched out. 'Are you capable of such a feat?' he wondered, full of admiration for his own courage. 'The whole town must hear about this!' And so, the little tailor quickly cut a strip of cloth for a belt, stitched it, and embroidered in large letters: 'Seven at one stroke!'

She climbed the steps with her heavy basket, and he had her show him all her jars. After examining and sniffing each, he declared the jam looked good and asked for four ounces, saying it didn't matter if she gave him a bit extra. Disappointed at only selling a small amount, the woman handed him the jam and left, muttering angrily. The tailor exclaimed that the jam would be blessed by God and bring him health, and then took out some bread, cut off a slice, and spread the jam onto it. He decided it would taste great, but would finish making a jacket before eating. He placed the bread nearby and kept sewing, his stitches getting larger as his good mood grew. Meanwhile, the sweet scent of jam attracted swarms of flies, which soon settled on his bread. Annoyed, the tailor shooed them, but since they ignored him, he finally lost patience. Grabbing a cloth, he struck the flies and killed seven at once. Impressed with himself, the tailor resolved to let everyone know of his feat. He quickly made himself a belt, sewing in big letters: \"Seven at one stroke!\" Proud, he declared that not only the town, but the whole world should hear of his achievement, his heart overflowing with joy."

          "text_segment": "The tailor put on the girdle, and resolved to go forth into the world, because he thought his workshop was too small for his valour. Before he went away, he sought about in the house to see if there was anything which he could take with him; however, he found nothing but an old cheese, and that he put in his pocket. In front of the door he observed a bird which had caught itself in the thicket. It had to go into his pocket with the cheese. Now he took to the road boldly, and as he was light and nimble, he felt no fatigue. The road led him up a mountain, and when he had reached the highest point of it, there sat a powerful giant looking peacefully about him. The little tailor went bravely up, spoke to him, and said: ‘Good day, comrade, so you are sitting there overlooking the wide-spread world! I am just on my way thither, and want to try my luck. Have you any inclination to go with me?’ The giant looked contemptuously at the tailor, and said: ‘You ragamuffin! You miserable creature!’\n‘Oh, indeed?’ answered the little tailor, and unbuttoned his coat, and showed the giant the girdle, ‘there may you read what kind of a man I am!’ The giant read: ‘Seven at one stroke,’ and thought that they had been men whom the tailor had killed, and began to feel a little respect for the tiny fellow. Nevertheless, he wished to try him first, and took a stone in his hand and squeezed it together so that water dropped out of it. ‘Do that likewise,’ said the giant, ‘if you have strength.’ ‘Is that all?’ said the tailor, ‘that is child’s play with us!’ and put his hand into his pocket, brought out the soft cheese, and pressed it until the liquid ran out of it. ‘Faith,’ said he, ‘that was a little better, wasn’t it?’ The giant did not know what to say, and could not believe it of the little man. Then the giant picked up a stone and threw it so high that the eye could scarcely follow it. ‘Now, little mite of a man, do that likewise,’ ‘Well thrown,’ said the tailor, ‘but after all the stone came down to earth again; I will throw you one which shall never come back at all,’ and he put his hand into his pocket, took out the bird, and threw it into the air. The bird, delighted with its liberty, rose, flew away and did not come back. ‘How does that shot please you, comrade?’ asked the tailor. ‘You can certainly throw,’ said the giant, ‘but now we will see if you are able to carry anything properly.’ He took the little tailor to a mighty oak tree which lay there felled on the ground, and said: ‘If you are strong enough, help me to carry the tree out of the forest.’ ‘Readily,’ answered the little man; ‘take you the trunk on your shoulders, and I will raise up the branches and twigs; after all, they are the heaviest.’ The giant took the trunk on his shoulder, but the tailor seated himself on a branch, and the giant, who could not look round, had to carry away the whole tree, and the little tailor into the bargain: he behind, was quite merry and happy, and whistled the song: ‘Three tailors rode forth from the gate,’ as if carrying the tree were child’s play. The giant, after he had dragged the heavy burden part of the way, could go no further, and cried: ‘Hark you, I shall have to let the tree fall!’ The tailor sprang nimbly down, seized the tree with both arms as if he had been carrying it, and said to the giant: ‘You are such a great fellow, and yet cannot even carry the tree!’\nThey went on together, and as they passed a cherry-tree, the giant laid hold of the top of the tree where the ripest fruit was hanging, bent it down, gave it into the tailor’s hand, and bade him eat. But the little tailor was much too weak to hold the tree, and when the giant let it go, it sprang back again, and the tailor was tossed into the air with it. When he had fallen down again without injury, the giant said: ‘What is this? Have you not strength enough to hold the weak twig?’ ‘There is no lack of strength,’ answered the little tailor. ‘Do you think that could be anything to a man who has struck down seven at one blow? I leapt over the tree because the huntsmen are shooting down there in the thicket. Jump as I did, if you can do it.’ The giant made the attempt but he could not get over the tree, and remained hanging in the branches, so that in this also the tailor kept the upper hand.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "After fastening the girdle, the tailor decided his courage was too vast for his tiny workshop and chose to venture into the world. Before departing, he looked around his house for anything useful but found only an old cheese, which he tucked into his pocket. Outside his door, he noticed a bird caught in a bush. It, too, ended up in his pocket with the cheese. He then set off boldly, and being light and quick, he didn't tire easily. His path led him up a mountain, and at the peak, he saw a mighty giant sitting peacefully. The small tailor bravely approached him and said, 'Hello there, friend, enjoying the view of the wide world? I'm just heading out to try my luck. Care to join me?' The giant looked at the tailor with disdain and retorted, 'You little nobody! You pathetic creature!' 'Is that right?' the little tailor replied, unbuttoning his jacket to show the giant the girdle. 'Read this to see what sort of man I am!' The giant read 'Seven at one stroke' and, believing it meant seven men the tailor had killed, began to feel a little respect for the tiny person. However, he wanted to test him first, so he picked up a stone and squeezed it until water dripped out. 'Do that,' the giant challenged, 'if you have the strength.' 'Is that all?' the tailor scoffed, 'That's simple for us!' He reached into his pocket, took out the soft cheese, and squeezed it until liquid ran out. 'See,' he boasted, 'that was a bit better, wasn't it?' The giant was speechless, unable to believe the little man had done it. Next, the giant picked up a stone and threw it so high it was almost out of sight. 'Now, you tiny little man, do the same.' 'Good throw,' said the tailor, 'but your stone came back down; I'll throw something that never returns.' He put his hand into his pocket, took out the bird, and tossed it into the air. The bird, delighted to be free, flew high and did not come back. 'How do you like that throw, friend?' asked the tailor. 'You can certainly throw,' the giant admitted, 'but let's see if you can actually carry anything properly.' He led the tailor to a huge oak tree lying felled on the ground and said, 'If you're strong enough, help me carry this tree out of the forest.' 'Gladly,' the little man answered. 'You take the trunk on your shoulders, and I'll lift the branches and twigs; they're the heaviest part, after all.' The giant put the trunk on his shoulder, but the tailor sat down on a branch. The giant, unable to see behind him, ended up carrying the entire tree plus the little tailor. The tailor, riding on the back, was cheerful and even whistled the song 'Three tailors rode forth from the gate,' as if carrying the tree was no effort at all. After dragging the heavy load for a while, the giant couldn't continue and cried, 'Listen, I have to drop the tree!' The tailor quickly jumped down, grasped the tree with both arms as if he had been helping carry it, and said to the giant, 'You're so big, and you can't even carry this tree!' They continued together, and as they passed a cherry tree, the giant grabbed the top with the ripest fruit, bent it down, and gave it to the tailor's hand, telling him to eat. But the little tailor was too weak to hold the tree down, and when the giant released it, it sprang back up, tossing the tailor into the air with it. When he landed safely back down, the giant said, 'What was that? Don't you have the strength to hold even that weak branch?' 'There's no lack of strength,' the little tailor replied. 'Do you think that would bother someone who killed seven with one blow? I jumped over the tree because there are hunters shooting in the thicket below. Try jumping like I did, if you can.' The giant attempted it but couldn't clear the tree and got stuck in the branches. In this way, the tailor again got the better of him.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "The tailor, feeling that his workshop was too modest for his bravery, put on his belt and decided to set out into the world. Before leaving, he searched his home for anything useful to bring, but only found an old cheese, which he stashed in his pocket. At his door, he noticed a bird caught in a bush; he freed it and put it with the cheese in his pocket. Setting off energetically, the tailor climbed a mountain where he encountered a powerful giant sitting contentedly. Undeterred, the tailor greeted the giant, mentioning he was journeying to seek his fortune, and invited the giant to join him. Looking down on the tailor, the giant insulted him, but the tailor coolly revealed his belt reading \"Seven at one stroke,\" making the giant believe he had defeated seven men and earning some respect, though the giant wanted to test him first.\n\nThe giant squeezed water from a stone and challenged the tailor to match his feat. The tailor, using his wit, squeezed the cheese until liquid came out, impressing the giant. Next, the giant tossed a stone high in the air. The tailor responded by releasing the bird, which flew away and never returned, claiming his throw was superior. For a final challenge, the giant asked the tailor to help carry a large felled oak tree out of the forest. The tailor cleverly rode on the branches while the giant carried the trunk, making it seem as though he, too, was bearing the load. When the giant was exhausted and set the tree down, the tailor jumped off and pretended to have carried the tree himself, taunting the giant.\n\nContinuing on, they saw a cherry tree with ripe fruit at the top. The giant bent the tree down for the tailor to eat, but when it sprang back, the tailor was flung into the air. Landing safely, he claimed he had leapt to avoid hunters below. When the giant tried and failed to leap the tree, getting stuck in the branches, the tailor once again outwitted him."

But he did not venture to give him his dismissal, for he dreaded lest he should strike him and all his people dead, and place himself on the royal throne. He thought about it for a long time, and at last found good counsel. He sent to the little tailor and caused him to be informed that as he was a great warrior, he had one request to make to him. In a forest of his country lived two giants, who caused great mischief with their robbing, murdering, ravaging, and burning, and no one could approach them without putting himself in danger of death. If the tailor conquered and killed these two giants, he would give him his only daughter to wife, and half of his kingdom as a dowry, likewise one hundred horsemen should go with him to assist him. ‘That would indeed be a fine thing for a man like me!’ thought the little tailor. ‘One is not offered a beautiful princess and half a kingdom every day of one’s life!’ ‘Oh, yes,’ he replied, ‘I will soon subdue the giants, and do not require the help of the hundred horsemen to do it; he who can hit seven with one blow has no need to be afraid of two.’\nThe little tailor went forth, and the hundred horsemen followed him. When he came to the outskirts of the forest, he said to his followers: ‘Just stay waiting here, I alone will soon finish off the giants.’ Then he bounded into the forest and looked about right and left. After a while he perceived both giants. They lay sleeping under a tree, and snored so that the branches waved up and down. The little tailor, not idle, gathered two pocketsful of stones, and with these climbed up the tree. When he was halfway up, he slipped down by a branch, until he sat just above the sleepers, and then let one stone after another fall on the breast of one of the giants. For a long time the giant felt nothing, but at last he awoke, pushed his comrade, and said: ‘Why are you knocking me?’ ‘You must be dreaming,’ said the other, ‘I am not knocking you.’ They laid themselves down to sleep again, and then the tailor threw a stone down on the second. ‘What is the meaning of this?’ cried the other ‘Why are you pelting me?’ ‘I am not pelting you,’ answered the first, growling. They disputed about it for a time, but as they were weary they let the matter rest, and their eyes closed once more. The little tailor began his game again, picked out the biggest stone, and threw it with all his might on the breast of the first giant. ‘That is too bad!’ cried he, and sprang up like a madman, and pushed his companion against the tree until it shook. The other paid him back in the same coin, and they got into such a rage that they tore up trees and belaboured each other so long, that at last they both fell down dead on the ground at the same time. Then the little tailor leapt down. ‘It is a lucky thing,’ said he, ‘that they did not tear up the tree on which I was sitting, or I should have had to sprint on to another like a squirrel; but we tailors are nimble.’ He drew out his sword and gave each of them a couple of thrusts in the breast, and then went out to the horsemen and said: ‘The work is done; I have finished both of them off, but it was hard work! They tore up trees in their sore need, and defended themselves with them, but all that is to no purpose when a man like myself comes, who can kill seven at one blow.’ ‘But are you not wounded?’ asked the horsemen. ‘You need not concern yourself about that,’ answered the tailor, ‘they have not bent one hair of mine.’ The horsemen would not believe him, and rode into the forest; there they found the giants swimming in their blood, and all round about lay the torn-up trees.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "However, the soldiers were hostile towards the small tailor and wished intensely that he were gone. They wondered amongst themselves what the outcome would be, concluding that if they provoked him and he started fighting, seven of them would die with each strike, and none of them could withstand him. Therefore, they made a joint decision, went together to the king, and requested to be discharged from service. They declared they were unwilling to serve alongside a man who could kill seven people in a single blow. The king was displeased at the prospect of losing all his loyal servants because of this one individual, regretting ever meeting the tailor and wishing he could easily get rid of him. Yet, he didn't dare dismiss the tailor, fearing the tailor might kill him and all his subjects and seize the throne. He pondered the situation for a long time before finally arriving at a clever solution. He sent for the little tailor and informed him that, given his reputation as a great warrior, the king had a special request for him. In a forest within the kingdom, two giants resided who caused significant trouble by robbing, murdering, destroying, and burning, making it fatal for anyone to approach them. If the tailor could defeat and kill these two giants, the king promised to give him his only daughter in marriage and half of his kingdom as a dowry, along with one hundred horsemen to assist him. The little tailor thought, 'This would be a truly wonderful achievement for someone like me! A beautiful princess and half a kingdom aren't offered every day!' So he replied, 'Yes, I will quickly defeat the giants, and I won't need the help of the hundred horsemen to do it; someone who can kill seven with one strike doesn't need to be afraid of two.' The little tailor departed, followed by the hundred horsemen. When he reached the edge of the forest, he told his followers, 'Just wait here; I will handle the giants by myself very quickly.' Then he swiftly entered the forest and began searching left and right. After a while, he spotted both giants. They were asleep under a tree, snoring so loudly that the branches above them moved up and down. The little tailor, always resourceful, collected two pockets full of stones and used them to climb the tree. Once he was halfway up, he carefully lowered himself down a branch until he was sitting directly above the sleeping pair, and then began dropping the stones one by one onto the chest of the first giant. The giant didn't feel anything for a long time, but eventually, he woke up, poked his companion, and asked, 'Why are you hitting me?' The other replied, 'You must be dreaming; I'm not hitting you.' They lay down to sleep again, and then the tailor threw a stone down on the second giant. 'What is the meaning of this?' cried the second. 'Why are you pelting me?' 'I am not pelting you,' the first answered irritably. They argued about it for a while, but being tired, they dropped the matter and their eyes closed once more. The little tailor resumed his activity, picking out the largest stone and throwing it with all his might onto the chest of the first giant. 'This is absolutely unacceptable!' he shouted, springing up like a madman and pushing his companion so hard against the tree that it shook. The other giant retaliated just as fiercely, and they became so furious that they tore up trees and beat each other with them for so long that eventually, they both fell dead on the ground at the same instant. Then the little tailor jumped down. 'It's fortunate,' he remarked, 'that they didn't pull up the tree I was sitting on, or I would have had to scramble onto another like a squirrel; but we tailors are quick.' He pulled out his sword and stabbed each of them a couple of times in the chest. He then went out to the horsemen and announced, 'The job is done; I have finished both of them off, but it was challenging work! They tore up trees in their desperate struggle and used them to defend themselves, but none of that matters against a man like me, who can kill seven with one blow.' 'But are you not injured?' the horsemen asked. 'You don't need to worry about that,' the tailor replied, 'they haven't bent a single hair on my head.' The horsemen were skeptical and rode into the forest; there they found the giants lying dead in their own blood, surrounded by the torn-up trees.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "The soldiers did not like the little tailor and wished he was far away. They worried among themselves, saying, \"What are we going to do? If we fight with him and he attacks us, seven of us could fall with each blow. None of us can defeat him.\" So they decided together to go to the king and ask to be dismissed. \"We can't stay with a man who can kill seven at once,\" they said. The king did not want to lose all his loyal soldiers because of the tailor and regretted ever meeting him. He would have gladly gotten rid of the tailor, but was too afraid—what if the tailor attacked and killed him and his people and seized the throne? The king thought hard about what to do and then came up with a plan. He sent word to the little tailor, saying that, since he was such a brave warrior, the king had a request: In a nearby forest lived two giants who terrorized the land by robbing, murdering, and destroying everything. No one dared face them. If the tailor could defeat the giants, the king would give him his only daughter in marriage and half of the kingdom, as well as a hundred horsemen to help. The little tailor thought it was a great offer, reasoning that he was not offered a princess and half a kingdom every day. He replied that he would take care of the giants alone, without the help of the hundred horsemen—someone who could kill seven at one blow had nothing to fear from two giants.\n\nSo, the little tailor set off, with the hundred horsemen following. When they reached the edge of the forest, the tailor told them to wait, while he went in alone. He soon spotted the two giants sleeping under a tree, snoring so loudly the branches shook. The tailor filled his pockets with stones and climbed the tree above them. From his perch, he began dropping stones onto the chest of one giant. The giant didn’t notice at first, but eventually woke up, blamed his companion for hitting him, and they argued, then went back to sleep. The tailor then dropped a stone on the second giant, who accused the first, and they quarreled again before dozing off once more. The tailor selected the largest stone and dropped it on the first giant's chest, causing him to spring up in anger and push his fellow, who retaliated. Their anger grew; they tore up trees and fought each other furiously until both fell dead.\n\nThe little tailor climbed down and remarked to himself how lucky he was that they hadn’t torn down his tree, or he would have had to leap to another like a squirrel—luckily, tailors are quick. To make sure the giants were really dead, he stabbed them each a few times, then went back to the horsemen, claiming he had defeated them single-handedly, though it had taken a lot of effort. He bragged about how the giants tore up trees in desperation, but it was pointless against someone who could kill seven at a stroke. The horsemen doubted his story and went into the forest—there, they saw the giants lying dead in their blood, and the ground littered with uprooted trees."

In the forest roams a unicorn which does great harm, and you must catch it first.’ ‘I fear one unicorn still less than two giants. Seven at one blow, is my kind of affair.’ He took a rope and an axe with him, went forth into the forest, and again bade those who were sent with him to wait outside. He had not long to seek. The unicorn soon came towards him, and rushed directly on the tailor, as if it would gore him with its horn without more ado. ‘Softly, softly; it can’t be done as quickly as that,’ said he, and stood still and waited until the animal was quite close, and then sprang nimbly behind the tree. The unicorn ran against the tree with all its strength, and stuck its horn so fast in the trunk that it had not the strength enough to draw it out again, and thus it was caught. ‘Now, I have got the bird,’ said the tailor, and came out from behind the tree and put the rope round its neck, and then with his axe he hewed the horn out of the tree, and when all was ready he led the beast away and took it to the king.\nThe king still would not give him the promised reward, and made a third demand. Before the wedding the tailor was to catch him a wild boar that made great havoc in the forest, and the huntsmen should give him their help. ‘Willingly,’ said the tailor, ‘that is child’s play!’ He did not take the huntsmen with him into the forest, and they were well pleased that he did not, for the wild boar had several times received them in such a manner that they had no inclination to lie in wait for him. When the boar perceived the tailor, it ran on him with foaming mouth and whetted tusks, and was about to throw him to the ground, but the hero fled and sprang into a chapel which was near and up to the window at once, and in one bound out again. The boar ran after him, but the tailor ran round outside and shut the door behind it, and then the raging beast, which was much too heavy and awkward to leap out of the window, was caught. The little tailor called the huntsmen thither that they might see the prisoner with their own eyes. The hero, however, went to the king, who was now, whether he liked it or not, obliged to keep his promise, and gave his daughter and the half of his kingdom.

Dealing with seven at a single stroke is my kind of business,' he replied. Taking a rope and an axe, he set off into the forest, again instructing those sent with him to wait outside. He didn't need to search long. The unicorn soon approached, charging directly at the tailor as if intent on goring him immediately with its horn. 'Hold on, hold on; it won't be done that quickly,' he said, standing still and waiting until the animal was very close before swiftly leaping behind a tree. The unicorn ran against the tree with all its might, embedding its horn so firmly in the trunk that it lacked the strength to pull it free, and thus was trapped. 'Now I've got him,' the tailor declared, emerging from behind the tree to place the rope around the unicorn's neck. Then, with his axe, he chopped the horn free from the tree. When everything was ready, he led the creature away and presented it to the king.\nThe king still refused to give him the promised reward and made a third demand. Before the wedding, the tailor was required to catch a wild boar that was causing great damage in the forest, with the huntsmen providing assistance. 'Gladly,' said the tailor, 'that's easy!' He did not take the huntsmen with him into the forest, which pleased them greatly, as the wild boar had previously handled them so roughly that they had no desire to confront it again. When the boar spotted the tailor, it charged at him with a frothing mouth and sharpened tusks, ready to throw him to the ground. But the hero fled, leaping into a nearby chapel and straight to the window, and in one jump, was back outside. The boar pursued him inside, but the tailor ran around the outside and shut the door behind it, thus trapping the furious beast, which was far too heavy and clumsy to leap out of the window. The little tailor called the huntsmen to the spot so they could see the captive with their own eyes. The hero then went to the king, who was now, like it or not, compelled to keep his promise, and gave him his daughter and half of his kingdom.

The tailor replied, 'I'm less afraid of one unicorn than I was of two giants—seven at one blow, that's what I do.' He took a rope and an axe, went into the forest, and told his companions to stay behind. Soon, he encountered the unicorn, which charged at him, trying to pierce him with its horn. The tailor calmly waited until the beast was close, then jumped behind a tree. The unicorn ran into the tree, its horn getting stuck so firmly that it couldn't pull it out. The tailor stepped out, put the rope around the unicorn's neck, used his axe to free its horn from the tree, then led the animal back to the king.

His wife replied, 'Listen, husband, tomorrow morning we'll take the children deep into the forest, light a fire for them, give them each a piece of bread, then leave them to fend for themselves while we go to work. They won’t be able to find their way back, and we’ll be rid of them.' The husband protested, saying, 'No, wife, I can't bear to leave my children alone in the woods—wild animals will surely come and eat them.' But his wife replied, 'If we don't, all four of us will starve; you might as well start making our coffins,' and she wouldn’t let him rest until he agreed. Still, the man said, 'I feel terribly sorry for the poor children.'"

The moon shone brightly, and the white pebbles which lay in front of the house glittered like real silver pennies.

They began to walk again, but they always came deeper into the forest, and if help did not come soon, they must die of hunger and weariness. When it was mid-day, they saw a beautiful snow-white bird sitting on a bough, which sang so delightfully that they stood still and listened to it. And when its song was over, it spread its wings and flew away before them, and they followed it until they reached a little house, on the roof of which it alighted; and when they approached the little house they saw that it was built of bread and covered with cakes, but that the windows were of clear sugar. ‘We will set to work on that,’ said Hansel, ‘and have a good meal. I will eat a bit of the roof, and you Gretel, can eat some of the window, it will taste sweet.’ Hansel reached up above, and broke off a little of the roof to try how it tasted, and Gretel leant against the window and nibbled at the panes. Then a soft voice cried from the parlour:\n‘Nibble, nibble, gnaw,\n  Who is nibbling at my little house?’\nThe children answered:\n‘The wind, the wind,\n  The heaven-born wind,’\nand went on eating without disturbing themselves. Hansel, who liked the taste of the roof, tore down a great piece of it, and Gretel pushed out the whole of one round window-pane, sat down, and enjoyed herself with it. Suddenly the door opened, and a woman as old as the hills, who supported herself on crutches, came creeping out. Hansel and Gretel were so terribly frightened that they let fall what they had in their hands. The old woman, however, nodded her head, and said: ‘Oh, you dear children, who has brought you here? do come in, and stay with me. No harm shall happen to you.’ She took them both by the hand, and led them into her little house. Then good food was set before them, milk and pancakes, with sugar, apples, and nuts. Afterwards two pretty little beds were covered with clean white linen, and Hansel and Gretel lay down in them, and thought they were in heaven.",

They resumed walking, but found themselves venturing deeper into the forest, and feared they would die from hunger and exhaustion if help didn't arrive soon. Around midday, they spotted a beautiful, pure white bird perched on a branch, singing so enchanting a tune that they paused to listen. When its song finished, it spread its wings and flew off ahead of them. They followed until they reached a small dwelling, where the bird landed on the roof. As they got closer to the little house, they saw it was constructed of bread with a roof of cakes, and windows made of sparkling, clear sugar. 'We should really eat this,' Hansel said, 'and have a proper meal. I'll eat some of the roof, and you, Gretel, can have a bit of the window; it looks wonderfully sweet.' Hansel reached up and broke off a piece of the roof to taste it, while Gretel leaned against a window and nibbled the sugar panes. Suddenly, a soft voice called out from inside: 'Nibble, nibble, gnaw, who's nibbling at my little house?' The children replied: 'The wind, the wind, the child of the heavens,' and kept eating without concern. Hansel, finding the roof delicious, tore off a large chunk, and Gretel pushed out an entire round windowpane, sat down, and thoroughly enjoyed it. Without warning, the door opened, and an incredibly old woman, supporting herself on crutches, slowly emerged. Hansel and Gretel were so terrified they dropped the pieces of house they were holding. However, the old woman nodded kindly and said, 'Oh, you poor dears, what brings you here? Do come inside and stay with me. You'll be perfectly safe.' She took them both by the hand and led them into her small house. Inside, a delightful meal was served, including milk, sugared pancakes, apples, and nuts. Afterwards, two lovely little beds were prepared with clean, white sheets, and Hansel and Gretel lay down, feeling as though they were in paradise.",

The duck came, and Hansel wanted them both to ride together, but Gretel thought the duck would be overburdened. So the duck ferried them across, one at a time. Once on the other side, the woods began to look more and more familiar, until at last they saw their father’s house in the distance. They ran home, rushed inside, and hugged their father tightly. Since leaving his children in the woods, their father had not known happiness; as for their stepmother, she had passed away. Gretel emptied her apron, scattering pearls and gems over the floor, and Hansel added even more from his pockets. All their cares were over, and they lived together in happiness. My story ends; a mouse runs by—whoever catches it may make a fine fur cap."

But the grandmother saw what was in his thoughts. In front of the house was a great stone trough, so she said to the child: ‘Take the pail, Red-Cap; I made some sausages yesterday, so carry the water in which I boiled them to the trough.’ Red-Cap carried until the great trough was quite full. Then the smell of the sausages reached the wolf, and he sniffed and peeped down, and at last stretched out his neck so far that he could no longer keep his footing and began to slip, and slipped down from the roof straight into the great trough, and was drowned. But Red-Cap went joyously home, and no one ever did anything to harm her again.",

However, Red-Cap was cautious and proceeded directly to her destination. She informed her grandmother about meeting the wolf, mentioning that although he had greeted her, his gaze was so sinister that she believed he would have devoured her if they hadn't been on a public road. Her grandmother said, \"Alright, we'll lock the door so he can't get in.\" Shortly thereafter, the wolf knocked and shouted, \"Open the door, Grandmother, it's Little Red-Cap with cakes!\" But they did not respond or open the door. The wolf then circled the house a few times before leaping onto the roof, planning to wait until Red-Cap left in the evening to secretly follow her and eat her in the dark. However, the grandmother perceived his plan. Seeing a large stone trough in front of the house, she told her granddaughter, \"Red-Cap, fetch the bucket. I made sausages yesterday, so carry the water I used for boiling them to the trough.\" Red-Cap continued bringing water until the large trough was full. The smell of the sausages reached the wolf, causing him to sniff and peer down. He stretched his neck so far that he lost his balance, began to slide, and fell off the roof directly into the large trough, where he drowned. Little Red-Cap then went home happily, and no one ever managed to hurt her again.",

This time, Red-Cap was careful, stayed on the road, and told her grandmother about the wolf who had greeted her suspiciously—she believed if they hadn't been on the main road, he would have eaten her. The grandmother replied that they would keep the door locked so the wolf couldn’t get in. Not long after, the wolf knocked and tried to trick them by pretending to be Red-Cap bringing cakes, but they stayed quiet and did not let him in. The wolf then circled the house several times and finally climbed onto the roof, intending to wait for Red-Cap to leave so he could follow and eat her in the dark. However, the grandmother guessed the wolf’s plan. She told Red-Cap to take the water left over from boiling some sausages and fill the big stone trough outside. When the wolf caught the scent, he leaned over too far, lost his balance, and fell into the trough, drowning. Afterwards, Red-Cap happily returned home, and no harm ever came to her again."

At last one took the other aside, and said, ‘That little urchin will make our fortune, if we can get him, and carry him about from town to town as a show; we must buy him.’ So they went up to the woodman, and asked him what he would take for the little man. ‘He will be better off,’ said they, ‘with us than with you.’ ‘I won’t sell him at all,’ said the father; ‘my own flesh and blood is dearer to me than all the silver and gold in the world.’ But Tom, hearing of the bargain they wanted to make, crept up his father’s coat to his shoulder and whispered in his ear, ‘Take the money, father, and let them have me; I’ll soon come back to you.’\nSo the woodman at last said he would sell Tom to the strangers for a large piece of gold, and they paid the price. ‘Where would you like to sit?’ said one of them. ‘Oh, put me on the rim of your hat; that will be a nice gallery for me; I can walk about there and see the country as we go along.’ So they did as he wished; and when Tom had taken leave of his father they took him away with them.\nThey journeyed on till it began to be dusky, and then the little man said, ‘Let me get down, I’m tired.’ So the man took off his hat, and put him down on a clod of earth, in a ploughed field by the side of the road. But Tom ran about amongst the furrows, and at last slipped into an old mouse-hole. ‘Good night, my masters!’ said he, ‘I’m off! mind and look sharp after me the next time.’ Then they ran at once to the place, and poked the ends of their sticks into the mouse-hole, but all in vain; Tom only crawled farther and farther in; and at last it became quite dark, so that they were forced to go their way without their prize, as sulky as could be.",

Eventually, one pulled the other aside and commented, 'If we can capture this tiny fellow and exhibit him in towns, he'll make our fortune. We must buy him.' So, they approached the woodcutter and inquired about the price of the little man, suggesting he'd be better off with them. 'I absolutely will not sell him,' the father declared, 'My own flesh and blood is more precious to me than all the world's silver and gold.' However, Tom, overhearing their proposed deal, scrambled up his father's coat to his shoulder and whispered in his ear, 'Accept the money, father, and let them take me; I promise I'll return to you soon.' As a result, the woodcutter eventually agreed to sell Tom to the strangers for a large gold coin, and they paid the price. One of them asked, 'Where would you like to ride?' 'Oh, place me on the brim of your hat,' he replied, 'that will serve as a wonderful viewpoint for me; I can stroll around there and observe the landscape as we travel.' They complied with his request; and after Tom bid farewell to his father, they took him away with them. They journeyed until it started to get dark, at which point the small person said, 'Let me dismount, I'm tired.' So, the man took off his hat and set him down on a piece of earth in a plowed field next to the road. But Tom darted among the furrows and finally disappeared into an old mouse-hole. 'Farewell, masters!' he called out, 'I'm off! Be sure to watch me more carefully next time.' They immediately rushed to the spot and poked their sticks into the mouse-hole, but their efforts were fruitless; Tom simply burrowed deeper and deeper; and eventually, it became completely dark, forcing them to continue their journey without their prize, feeling utterly disgruntled.",

The father replied, \"I won't sell him at any price; my own flesh and blood is more precious than all the money in the world.\" However, Tom, overhearing their conversation, climbed up his father’s coat and whispered, \"Take their money and let them have me; I’ll come back soon enough.\" Finally, the woodman agreed to sell Tom for a large gold coin, and after the transaction, the strangers asked Tom where he wanted to ride. \"Just put me on the brim of your hat; that'll be a perfect spot for me to see everything along the journey,\" Tom replied. They followed his suggestion, and after Tom bid farewell to his father, they took him away. They traveled until dusk when Tom asked to be let down because he was tired. The man took off his hat and set Tom on a clod of earth in a freshly ploughed field next to the road. Tom then scampered through the furrows and eventually disappeared into an old mouse hole. \"Good night, gentlemen!\" he called, \"I’m off!

As soon as he had had enough he wanted to get away; but he had eaten so much that he could not go out by the same way he came in.\nThis was just what Tom had reckoned upon; and now he began to set up a great shout, making all the noise he could. ‘Will you be easy?’ said the wolf; ‘you’ll awaken everybody in the house if you make such a clatter.’ ‘What’s that to me?’ said the little man; ‘you have had your frolic, now I’ve a mind to be merry myself’; and he began, singing and shouting as loud as he could.\nThe woodman and his wife, being awakened by the noise, peeped through a crack in the door; but when they saw a wolf was there, you may well suppose that they were sadly frightened; and the woodman ran for his axe, and gave his wife a scythe. ‘Do you stay behind,’ said the woodman, ‘and when I have knocked him on the head you must rip him up with the scythe.’ Tom heard all this, and cried out, ‘Father, father! I am here, the wolf has swallowed me.’ And his father said, ‘Heaven be praised! we have found our dear child again’; and he told his wife not to use the scythe for fear she should hurt him. Then he aimed a great blow, and struck the wolf on the head, and killed him on the spot! and when he was dead they cut open his body, and set Tommy free. ‘Ah!’ said the father, ‘what fears we have had for you!’ ‘Yes, father,’ answered he; ‘I have travelled all over the world, I think, in one way or other, since we parted; and now I am very glad to come home and get fresh air again.’ ‘Why, where have you been?’ said his father. ‘I have been in a mouse-hole—and in a snail-shell—and down a cow’s throat—and in the wolf’s belly; and yet here I am again, safe and sound.’",

However, just as he managed to free his head, misfortune struck again. A hungry wolf suddenly appeared, swallowed the entire stomach with Tom inside in a single gulp, and ran off. Undeterred, Tom remained hopeful. Believing the wolf might enjoy some conversation during his journey, Tom called out, 'Hey there, friend! I know where you can find a wonderful feast.' 'Oh? Where?' asked the wolf. 'At a certain house,' Tom replied, describing his father's home. He instructed, 'You can squeeze through the drain into the kitchen and then into the pantry. Inside, you'll discover cakes, ham, beef, cold chicken, roast pig, apple dumplings - everything your heart desires.' The wolf didn't hesitate. That very night, he went to the house, crawled through the drain into the kitchen, reached the pantry, and ate and drank his fill. When he was satisfied, he wanted to leave, but he had consumed so much that he couldn't fit back through the way he entered. This was precisely what Tom had planned. Now, he began to make a tremendous racket, shouting as loud as he could. 'Quiet down!' the wolf demanded, 'You'll wake everyone in the house with all that noise!' 'Why should I care?' the little man retorted, 'You've had your fun, now I want to have mine!' And he continued singing and yelling at the top of his lungs. The woodman and his wife were woken by the commotion. They peeked through a crack in the door, and seeing a wolf there naturally terrified them. The woodman grabbed his axe, and his wife took a scythe. 'Stay back,' the woodman told her, 'and after I hit him on the head, you cut him open with the scythe.' Tom heard all this and shouted, 'Father, father! I'm here! The wolf swallowed me!' His father exclaimed, 'Thank heaven! We've found our dear child!' He told his wife not to use the scythe so she wouldn't accidentally hurt Tom. Then he took careful aim and struck the wolf on the head with the axe, killing it instantly. Once the wolf was dead, they cut open its body and freed Tommy. 'Oh,' said his father, 'we were so worried about you!' 'Yes, father,' he replied, 'I feel like I've traveled around the whole world in one way or another since we last saw each other. I'm very happy to be home and breathe fresh air again.' 'Goodness, where have you been?' his father asked. 'I've been in a mouse hole, in a snail shell, down a cow's throat, and inside the wolf's belly; but look, here I am again, safe and sound.'",

The delicious aroma tempted her, so she thought, 'Maybe I should taste it to make sure it's alright.' She touched one and said, 'These chickens are so good! It's almost a crime not to eat them while they're perfect.' She checked the window to see if her master and his guest were approaching, but saw no one, so she went back and noticed a wing was burning. She decided to remove and eat it, enjoying it thoroughly. After finishing the wing, she reasoned that the other wing should be eaten too, otherwise her master would notice it missing. Once both wings were gone, she looked again for her master but he still hadn't arrived. It occurred to her that perhaps they wouldn't be coming at all, maybe they'd stopped somewhere else. So she thought, 'Why not enjoy myself? One chicken has already been started; I should have another drink and eat the rest. Better to enjoy these gifts than let them go to waste.' She went to the cellar for a big drink, then happily finished off the first chicken. Still, her master did not appear. Looking at the second chicken, she reasoned, 'What happened to one should happen to the other; they belong together. Another good drink won’t hurt.' She took another swig and ate the second chicken as well."

The calf just stood there looking like it was eating, and the cow-herd thought, ‘It’ll soon be able to walk, since it seems to be grazing already!’ In the evening, as he gathered the cattle to return home, the cow-herd told the calf: ‘If you can eat standing there, you can walk on your own legs, so I won’t carry you back.’ The little peasant waited at his door for the calf, but when the herd returned, the calf was missing. The peasant asked the cow-herd about it, and he replied: ‘It stayed in the field eating and wouldn’t come back with us.’ The little peasant insisted he needed his calf back, so they both returned to the meadow, only to find that someone had stolen the calf. The cow-herd claimed it must have run off, but the peasant didn’t believe him.

But as the weather grew so bad and there was a storm of rain and wind, he could go no farther, and turned back to the mill and begged for shelter. The miller’s wife was alone in the house, and said to the peasant: ‘Lay yourself on the straw there,’ and gave him a slice of bread and cheese. The peasant ate it, and lay down with his skin beside him, and the woman thought: ‘He is tired and has gone to sleep.’ In the meantime came the parson; the miller’s wife received him well, and said: ‘My husband is out, so we will have a feast.’ The peasant listened, and when he heard them talk about feasting he was vexed that he had been forced to make shift with a slice of bread and cheese. Then the woman served up four different things, roast meat, salad, cakes, and wine.\nJust as they were about to sit down and eat, there was a knocking outside. The woman said: ‘Oh, heavens!

Then she opened the door for her husband, and said: ‘Thank heaven, you are back again! There is such a storm, it looks as if the world were coming to an end.’ The miller saw the peasant lying on the straw, and asked, ‘What is that fellow doing there?’ ‘Ah,’ said the wife, ‘the poor knave came in the storm and rain, and begged for shelter, so I gave him a bit of bread and cheese, and showed him where the straw was.’ The man said: ‘I have no objection, but be quick and get me something to eat.’ The woman said: ‘But I have nothing but bread and cheese.’ ‘I am contented with anything,’ replied the husband, ‘so far as I am concerned, bread and cheese will do,’ and looked at the peasant and said: ‘Come and eat some more with me.’ The peasant did not require to be invited twice, but got up and ate. After this the miller saw the skin in which the raven was, lying on the ground, and asked: ‘What have you there?’ The peasant answered: ‘I have a soothsayer inside it.’ ‘Can he foretell anything to me?’ said the miller. ‘Why not?’ answered the peasant: ‘but he only says four things, and the fifth he keeps to himself.’ The miller was curious, and said: ‘Let him foretell something for once.’ Then the peasant pinched the raven’s head, so that he croaked and made a noise like krr, krr. The miller said: ‘What did he say?’ The peasant answered: ‘In the first place, he says that there is some wine hidden under the pillow.’ ‘Bless me!’ cried the miller, and went there and found the wine. ‘Now go on,’ said he. The peasant made the raven croak again, and said: ‘In the second place, he says that there is some roast meat in the tiled stove.’ ‘Upon my word!’ cried the miller, and went thither, and found the roast meat.

However, they lacked provisions to feed it and could give it nothing to eat, so it had to be butchered soon after. They preserved the meat by salting it, and the farmer set out for town to sell the hide, hoping to use the money to purchase a new calf. While en route, he passed a mill and observed a raven with injured wings sitting there. Moved by compassion, he picked it up and wrapped it in the cowhide. But as the weather took a turn for the worse with a heavy storm of rain and wind, he was unable to continue his journey. He turned back towards the mill and requested shelter. The miller's wife was alone in the house and instructed the farmer, 'Lie down on the straw there,' and provided him with a piece of bread and cheese. The farmer ate and lay down with the hide by his side, and the woman assumed he was tired and had fallen asleep. Meanwhile, the parson arrived. The miller's wife welcomed him warmly, stating, 'My husband is away, so we shall enjoy a feast.' The farmer listened, and hearing them discuss having a feast, he was annoyed that he had been given only a meager slice of bread and cheese. The woman then served a meal consisting of four dishes: roast meat, salad, cakes, and wine. Just as they were about to sit down to eat, there was a knock at the door from outside. The woman exclaimed, 'Oh dear me! It's my husband!' She rapidly concealed the roast meat inside the tiled oven, the wine beneath a pillow, the salad on the bed, and the cakes under it. She hid the parson in the small cupboard on the porch. Then she opened the door for her husband, saying, 'Thank goodness you're back! There's such a terrible storm raging, it seems like the end of the world.' The miller spotted the farmer lying on the straw and asked, 'What is that fellow doing here?' 'Ah,' said his wife, 'the poor man arrived in the storm and rain and begged for shelter, so I gave him a little bread and cheese and showed him where the straw was.' The husband said, 'I have no objection, but quickly get me something to eat.' The woman replied, 'But I have nothing except bread and cheese.' 'I am fine with anything,' the husband responded, 'as far as I'm concerned, bread and cheese will suffice.' He looked at the farmer and said, 'Come and share some more with me.' The farmer did not need to be asked a second time; he got up and ate. After this, the miller saw the hide containing the raven lying on the ground and asked, 'What do you have there?' The farmer answered, 'I have a fortune-teller inside it.' 'Can it predict anything for me?' inquired the miller. 'Certainly,' replied the farmer, 'but it only tells four things; it keeps the fifth a secret.' The miller was intrigued and said, 'Let it predict something for me now.' The farmer then gently squeezed the raven's head, making it croak and produce a sound like krr, krr. The miller asked, 'What did it say?' The farmer responded, 'Firstly, it says there is some wine hidden under the pillow.' 'Good heavens!' cried the miller, and he went there and discovered the wine. 'Continue,' he said. The farmer made the raven croak again and said, 'Secondly, it says there is some roast meat in the tiled stove.' 'Upon my word!' exclaimed the miller, and he went there and found the roast meat. The farmer made the raven prophesy further, saying, 'Thirdly, it says there is some salad on the bed.' 'That would be quite a thing!' cried the miller, and he went there and found the salad.

They salted its meat, and the peasant brought the hide to town to sell it with the intention of buying a calf. On his way, he passed a mill and found a raven with a broken wing; feeling sorry, he wrapped the bird in the cow skin. When bad weather struck—rain and wind—he couldn't go farther and returned to the mill, asking for shelter. The miller’s wife, who was alone, let him rest on some straw, gave him bread and cheese, and presumed he fell asleep. Meanwhile, the parson arrived, and the woman, whose husband was away, prepared a feast for the two of them. The peasant, hearing this, was upset to have only bread and cheese. The woman then laid out meat, salad, cakes, and wine. Suddenly, someone knocked—it was her husband. In haste, she hid the meat in the stove, the wine under a pillow, the salad on the bed, the cakes underneath, and the parson in a closet. Welcoming her husband, she told him of the storm and explained the peasant on the straw had come for shelter and a little food. The miller was fine with this and asked for food himself; the wife said she only had bread and cheese, which the husband accepted, inviting the peasant to share. While they ate, the miller noticed the skin and asked about it, to which the peasant replied he had a soothsayer inside (meaning the raven). Curious, the miller asked for a prophecy. Each time the peasant made the raven croak, he revealed one of the hidden items—the wine, the meat, the salad, and the cakes—which the miller then found in their hiding places."

The little peasant, despite being innocent, was unanimously condemned to death and sentenced to be drowned in a barrel filled with holes. He was brought out, and a priest was called to administer last rites. Everyone else was made to stand far away, and when the peasant saw the priest, he recognized him as the man who'd been with the miller's wife. So he said to the priest, \"I freed you from the closet, so now free me from this barrel.\" Just then, a shepherd whom the peasant knew had long wished to become mayor arrived with his flock. The peasant shouted loudly, \"No, I won't do it! Even if everyone insists, I won't become mayor!\" Hearing this, the shepherd approached and asked what he meant. The peasant replied, \"They want to make me mayor if I’m willing to go in this barrel, but I refuse.\" The shepherd responded, \"If that's all it takes to become mayor, I'd climb into the barrel right away!\" The peasant agreed, and as soon as the shepherd got in, the peasant closed the lid, took the shepherd’s sheep, and left. The priest returned and told the crowd the rites had been performed. The villagers rolled the barrel to the water, and as they did, the shepherd inside cried out, \"I'm happy to be mayor!\" Thinking it was the peasant, the villagers replied, \"That's our intention, but you’ll first spend some time at the bottom!\" And with that, they pushed the barrel into the water."

I am going to work in the fields; when I come back I shall be hungry so let me have something nice cooked, and a good draught of ale.’ ‘Very well,’ said she, ‘it shall all be ready.’ When dinner-time drew nigh, Catherine took a nice steak, which was all the meat she had, and put it on the fire to fry. The steak soon began to look brown, and to crackle in the pan; and Catherine stood by with a fork and turned it: then she said to herself, ‘The steak is almost ready, I may as well go to the cellar for the ale.’ So she left the pan on the fire and took a large jug and went into the cellar and tapped the ale cask. The beer ran into the jug and Catherine stood looking on. At last it popped into her head, ‘The dog is not shut up—he may be running away with the steak; that’s well thought of.’ So up she ran from the cellar; and sure enough the rascally cur had got the steak in his mouth, and was making off with it.\nAway ran Catherine, and away ran the dog across the field: but he ran faster than she, and stuck close to the steak. ‘It’s all gone, and “what can’t be cured must be endured”,’ said Catherine. So she turned round; and as she had run a good way and was tired, she walked home leisurely to cool herself.\nNow all this time the ale was running too, for Catherine had not turned the cock; and when the jug was full the liquor ran upon the floor till the cask was empty. When she got to the cellar stairs she saw what had happened. ‘My stars!’ said she, ‘what shall I do to keep Frederick from seeing all this slopping about?’ So she thought a while; and at last remembered that there was a sack of fine meal bought at the last fair, and that if she sprinkled this over the floor it would suck up the ale nicely. ‘What a lucky thing,’ said she, ‘that we kept that meal! we have now a good use for it.’ So away she went for it: but she managed to set it down just upon the great jug full of beer, and upset it; and thus all the ale that had been saved was set swimming on the floor also. ‘Ah! well,’ said she, ‘when one goes another may as well follow.’ Then she strewed the meal all about the cellar, and was quite pleased with her cleverness, and said, ‘How very neat and clean it looks!’\nAt noon Frederick came home. ‘Now, wife,’ cried he, ‘what have you for dinner?’ ‘O Frederick!’ answered she, ‘I was cooking you a steak; but while I went down to draw the ale, the dog ran away with it; and while I ran after him, the ale ran out; and when I went to dry up the ale with the sack of meal that we got at the fair, I upset the jug: but the cellar is now quite dry, and looks so clean!’ ‘Kate, Kate,’ said he, ‘how could you do all this?’ Why did you leave the steak to fry, and the ale to run, and then spoil all the meal?’ ‘Why, Frederick,’ said she, ‘I did not know I was doing wrong; you should have told me before.’",

One day, as Frederick prepared to go work in the fields, he told Catherine that he would be hungry upon his return and asked her to have a good meal and ale ready. Catherine agreed. As lunchtime approached, Catherine decided to cook their only piece of meat, a nice steak. She put it in a pan on the fire to fry and watched it start to brown, turning it with a fork. Thinking the steak was nearly done, she decided to fetch the ale from the cellar, leaving the pan unattended. She took a large jug, went downstairs, and opened the tap on the ale cask, watching the beer flow into the jug. Suddenly, it occurred to her that the dog might not be secured and could steal the steak. She quickly rushed upstairs, and just as she feared, the dog had grabbed the steak and was running off with it. Catherine chased the dog across the field, but the dog was faster and kept hold of the steak. Realizing it was gone, Catherine accepted the loss, saying, “What can't be changed must be accepted.\" Since she had run quite a distance and was tired, she walked back home slowly to recover. Meanwhile, the ale continued to pour because Catherine had not closed the tap. When the jug overflowed, the beer spilled all over the cellar floor until the cask was empty. Upon reaching the cellar stairs, she saw the disaster. \"Oh dear!\" she exclaimed. \"How can I hide this mess from Frederick?\" After thinking for a moment, she remembered a sack of fine meal they had bought recently and thought sprinkling it on the floor would absorb the ale nicely. “How fortunate we kept that meal!” she said, “It will be very useful now.” She went to get the meal, but in doing so, she accidentally placed the sack right on top of the full jug of beer, knocking it over and spilling the ale she had managed to collect onto the floor as well. “Oh well,” she sighed, “if some is gone, the rest might as well follow.” She then spread the entire sack of meal across the cellar floor, pleased with how clean and neat it looked. At noon, Frederick arrived home and asked, \"Wife, what is for dinner?\" \"Oh, Frederick!\" she replied. \"I was making you a steak, but while I went for the ale, the dog stole it. While I chased the dog, the ale ran out. Then, when I tried to soak up the ale with the sack of meal from the fair, I knocked over the jug. But the cellar is completely dry now and looks very clean!\" \"Kate, Kate,\" he said, bewildered, \"how could you let all this happen? Why did you leave the steak, let the ale run, and then waste the meal?\" \"Why, Frederick,\" she responded, \"I didn't realize it was wrong; you should have told me beforehand.\"",

She came up with the idea to sprinkle a sack of meal over the ale to soak it up, pleased to have found a use for it. However, as she brought the meal to the cellar, she accidentally knocked over the jug of beer, causing even more mess. Undeterred, she spread the meal, believing she had cleaned up nicely. When Frederick returned and asked about dinner, Catherine explained the string of mishaps—the dog stealing the steak, the ale overflowing, and the spilled meal—but assured him the cellar was now clean. Frederick scolded her for her carelessness, but she replied that she didn’t know she was doing anything wrong and wished he had told her beforehand."

Frederick replied, 'Alright, we can try, but bring some butter and cheese along so that we have something to eat on the way.' She agreed, and the two set out. Frederick walked faster than Catherine, so he quickly left her behind. Catherine thought, 'That’s no problem; when we turn back, I’ll be closer to home than he is.' Soon, she reached the top of a hill, where the narrow road made wagon wheels rub against the trees and damage them. Feeling sorry for the trees, she decided to use her butter to grease them so the wheels wouldn’t hurt them as much. In the process, one of her cheeses dropped from her basket and rolled away down the hill. Unable to see where it ended up, she said, 'Well, I imagine the second cheese will go after the first and catch up, since it has younger legs than I do.' She sent the second cheese rolling after the first, and away it went down the hill. Catherine figured they would know their own way and she couldn’t wait around all day for them. Eventually, she caught up with Frederick, who asked her for something to eat. She gave him only the dry bread. When he asked where the butter and cheese were, she explained she’d used the butter to help the damaged trees, and after one cheese rolled away, she sent the other after it, assuming both cheeses were somewhere together on the road. Frederick scolded her for being so foolish, but she replied that he had never told her not to do those things."

She changed her attire completely, dressing in a different outfit than her previous disguise, and brought with her a comb laced with poison.

But the queen enticed her by showing her the beautiful comb, and Snowdrop, attracted by its beauty, took it and placed it in her hair.

Next, she disguised herself as an old farmer's wife and traveled over the mountains to the cottage where the dwarfs lived. She knocked on the door, but Snow White put her head out of the window and said, 'I cannot let anyone inside, as the dwarfs have forbidden me to.' 'Do as you wish,' the old woman replied, 'but please, take this lovely apple anyway; I will give it to you.' 'No,' said Snow White, 'I mustn't take it.' 'You foolish girl!' the other woman responded, 'What are you afraid of? Do you suspect it is poisoned? Come now! You eat half, and I will eat the other half.' The apple had been cunningly made so that one half was safe to eat, while the other half was poisoned. Snow White was greatly tempted to try it because the apple looked so appealing, and when she saw the old woman take a bite, she could not wait any longer.

On this the huntsman asked the king if he would like to see the dog in his true shape, and wished him back into the form of the cook, in which he stood immediately, with his white apron, and his knife by his side. When the king saw him he fell into a passion, and ordered him to be cast into the deepest dungeon. Then the huntsman spoke further and said: ‘Father, will you see the maiden who brought me up so tenderly and who was afterwards to murder me, but did not do it, though her own life depended on it?’ The king replied: ‘Yes, I would like to see her.’ The son said: ‘Most gracious father, I will show her to you in the form of a beautiful flower,’ and he thrust his hand into his pocket and brought forth the pink, and placed it on the royal table, and it was so beautiful that the king had never seen one to equal it. Then the son said: ‘Now will I show her to you in her own form,’ and wished that she might become a maiden, and she stood there looking so beautiful that no painter could have made her look more so.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "The king was overjoyed by this news and ordered a grand feast for the following day, commanding his entire court to dine with him. When everyone was gathered, he addressed the huntsman, saying, 'Because you are so clever, you will sit by my side.' The huntsman initially declined, stating, 'Your Majesty, please excuse me, I am only a humble huntsman.' However, the king insisted, repeating, 'You shall sit by me,' until the huntsman complied. As he sat there, the huntsman's thoughts turned to his beloved mother. He wished that one of the king's chief servants might mention her, inquiring about the queen's condition in the tower, whether she was still alive or had died. No sooner had this thought crossed his mind than the marshal began speaking, saying, 'Your Majesty, we live joyfully here, but what is the queen's fate in the tower? Is she alive, or has she perished?' The king responded, 'She allowed my dear son to be torn apart by wild beasts; I refuse to hear her name mentioned.' At this, the huntsman stood up and declared, 'Gracious Lord Father, she is indeed still alive, and I am her son. I was not killed by wild animals, but kidnapped by that wicked old cook, who snatched me from her arms while she slept and stained her apron with the blood of a chicken.' He then indicated the dog with the golden collar, saying, 'This creature is the villain!' He ordered live coals to be brought, which the dog was forced to swallow before everyone's eyes until flames erupted from its throat. Following this, the huntsman asked the king if he would like to see the dog in its true form, and wished it back into the shape of the cook. Immediately, the cook stood there, wearing his white apron and with his knife at his side. Upon seeing him, the king flew into a rage and ordered him thrown into the deepest dungeon. The huntsman continued, saying, 'Father, would you like to see the maiden who raised me so lovingly and who later intended to murder me but didn't, even though her own life was at risk?' The king replied, 'Yes, I would like to see her.' His son said, 'Most gracious father, I will show her to you as a beautiful flower.' He reached into his pocket, produced the pink, and placed it on the royal table. It was so exquisitely beautiful that the king had never seen its equal. Then his son said, 'Now I will show her to you in her human form,' and wished her to become a maiden. She instantly stood there, looking so beautiful that no artist could have painted her more lovely.",

When everyone had gathered, he told the huntsman, 'Since you are so wise, you should sit beside me.' The huntsman protested, saying he was only a poor huntsman, but the king insisted until he agreed. While seated at the table, the huntsman thought of his dear mother and hoped that one of the king's high-ranking servants would mention her and ask about the queen in the tower, wondering if she was still alive. No sooner had he wished this than the marshal spoke up, asking the king about the queen. The king responded bitterly, saying she had caused his son to be torn apart by wild animals and that he did not want to hear her name. The huntsman then stood up and revealed the truth: he told the king he was his son, that he had not been killed by wild animals, but that the old cook had stolen him from his mother and faked his death by using a chicken's blood. Pointing to the dog with the golden collar, the huntsman claimed it was the villainous cook, and had live coals brought, which the dog was forced to eat until flames came from its mouth. He then asked if the king wanted to see the dog’s real form, wished it so, and the cook appeared, dressed in his apron and carrying his knife. Enraged, the king ordered the cook to be thrown into the darkest dungeon. The huntsman then asked if the king wanted to see the kind maiden who had cared for him and spared his life despite being ordered to kill him. The king said yes, so the huntsman produced a beautiful carnation flower and placed it on the table. Finally, he wished the flower to become a maiden, and it transformed into a girl so lovely the king had never seen anyone so beautiful."

As they passed the hazel tree planted by Ashputtel, a dove sang a warning, telling the prince to check the shoe, as it didn't belong to his true bride. The prince noticed blood pouring from her foot, realized she tricked him, and brought her back, demanding the other sister try the slipper. The second sister got her foot in except for her heel, which was too large, but her mother forced it in until blood flowed, and she was also presented to the prince.

However, her pride still would not let her accept him, so she declared: 'Even though he has accomplished both tasks, he shall not marry me unless he brings me an apple from the Tree of Life.' The young man did not know where the Tree of Life was, but he set out on a journey anyway, determined to search for it as long as he could, despite having little hope. After traveling through three kingdoms, he finally found himself, at nightfall, in a forest where he lay down under a tree to sleep. As he rested, he heard a soft sound above him, and a golden apple fell into his hand. At that moment, three ravens landed on his knee and said, 'We are the young ravens you once saved from starvation. When we learned you were looking for the Golden Apple, we flew over the sea to the world’s end, where the Tree of Life grows, and we have brought you the apple.' Overjoyed, the young man set off for home and presented the Golden Apple to the king’s daughter, who could make no further objections. They split the Apple of Life, ate it together, and her heart became filled with love for him, so they lived together in perfect happiness for the rest of their days."

They had a deep affection for each other but were greatly saddened by their lack of children. Their desire for a child was so intense that the wife prayed for one incessantly, day and night, yet they remained childless. In the courtyard before their house stood a juniper tree. One winter day, the wife was beneath the tree peeling apples when she cut her finger, and the blood dropped onto the snow. 'Ah,' the woman sighed deeply, 'if only I had a child, as red as blood and as white as snow.' As she uttered these words, her heart felt lighter, and she felt a sense that her wish would be fulfilled, returning to her home feeling cheerful and reassured. A month went by, and the snow melted entirely; then another month passed, and the whole earth turned green. The months continued, and the trees in the forest first began to bud, followed by the green branches growing thick and intertwined, and then the blossoms started to fall. The wife stood under the juniper tree again, and its sweet scent filled her with such joy that her heart leaped, and she was so overcome with happiness that she fell to her knees. Eventually, the fruit on the tree became round and firm, and she felt peaceful and content. But when the berries ripened fully, she picked and ate them eagerly, which caused her to become sad and ill. A short while later, she tearfully called her husband and said, 'If I die, bury me under the juniper tree.' Afterward, she felt comforted and happy once more, and before another month had passed, she gave birth to a small child. When she saw that the baby was as white as snow and as red as blood, her joy was so immense that she died.",

The couple cared for each other deeply, yet they were unhappy because they had no children. The wife wished for a child so much that she prayed every day and night, but their wish remained unfulfilled. In the courtyard before their home stood a juniper tree. One cold winter day, the wife was peeling apples beneath this tree, and accidentally cut her finger, causing blood to drop onto the snow. She sighed, longing, 'If only I had a child as red as blood and as white as snow.' As she voiced this desire, she felt her spirits lift, believing her wish would come true, and went back inside feeling cheerful and reassured. Time passed; after a month, the snow melted, then another month brought green growth to the earth. The seasons changed, the trees in the forest budded, their green branches thickened, and blossoms eventually fell. The wife again stood under the juniper tree, whose fragrance filled her with such joy that she dropped to her knees in happiness. Soon, the fruit grew round and ripe, which pleased and soothed her; when fully ripe, she picked and ate the berries eagerly, but then she became sad and unwell. Not long after, she called for her husband, and tearfully said, 'If I die, bury me beneath the juniper tree.' This thought comforted her, and before another month passed, she bore a child. Seeing that the child was as white as snow and as red as blood, she was so overcome with happiness that she passed away."

At last it was so big that it filled a cart, and two oxen could hardly draw it; and the gardener knew not what in the world to do with it, nor whether it would be a blessing or a curse to him. One day he said to himself, ‘What shall I do with it? if I sell it, it will bring no more than another; and for eating, the little turnips are better than this; the best thing perhaps is to carry it and give it to the king as a mark of respect.’\nThen he yoked his oxen, and drew the turnip to the court, and gave it to the king. ‘What a wonderful thing!’ said the king; ‘I have seen many strange things, but such a monster as this I never saw. Where did you get the seed? or is it only your good luck? If so, you are a true child of fortune.’ ‘Ah, no!’ answered the gardener, ‘I am no child of fortune; I am a poor soldier, who never could get enough to live upon; so I laid aside my red coat, and set to work, tilling the ground. I have a brother, who is rich, and your majesty knows him well, and all the world knows him; but because I am poor, everybody forgets me.’\nThe king then took pity on him, and said, ‘You shall be poor no longer. I will give you so much that you shall be even richer than your brother.’ Then he gave him gold and lands and flocks, and made him so rich that his brother’s fortune could not at all be compared with his.",

The less fortunate brother decided to try and improve his situation. He resigned from the army, removed his uniform, and started a new life as a gardener. He worked diligently, preparing his soil and planting turnip seeds. When the plants sprouted, one turnip grew far larger than all the others. It continued expanding relentlessly, as if it would never stop, becoming so exceptionally large it could be called the king of turnips, a specimen unmatched in history. Eventually, it became so massive that it completely filled a cart, requiring two oxen to pull it. The gardener was puzzled by this giant turnip, unsure if it would prove beneficial or detrimental. One day he mused, 'What should I do with this thing? If I sell it, it won't fetch any more than a regular turnip, and the smaller ones are better for eating. Perhaps the best course of action is to transport it and present it to the king as a token of respect.' He then harnessed his oxen, hauled the enormous turnip to the royal court, and offered it to the king. 'What an extraordinary sight!' exclaimed the king. 'I have witnessed many peculiar things, but never such a gigantic specimen. Where did you obtain the seed? Or is this simply a matter of great luck? If so, you are truly favored by fortune.' 'Oh, no,' replied the gardener, 'I am not a child of fortune. I was a poor soldier who could never earn enough to live comfortably, so I left the military and began cultivating the land. I have a wealthy brother, whom your majesty knows well, and he is famous throughout the world. But because I am poor, everyone overlooks me.' The king felt compassion for him and declared, 'You shall no longer be poor. I will give you so much wealth that you will surpass even your brother in riches.' The king then bestowed upon him gold, lands, and livestock, making him so prosperous that his brother's wealth seemed insignificant in comparison.",

He removed his soldier’s uniform and took up work as a gardener, putting effort into digging and planting turnips. Out of all the seeds he planted, one turnip grew larger than any he’d ever seen—larger than the rest, continually expanding, until it seemed like the 'prince' of turnips. It became so huge that it took up an entire cart, and even two oxen struggled to pull it. The gardener was unsure whether this giant turnip would turn out to be good or bad luck. After considering his options—thinking it wouldn’t fetch a high price and wasn’t good for eating—he decided the best thing was to present it to the king as a gesture of respect. He attached his oxen to the cart and delivered the enormous turnip to the royal court. The king was amazed, claiming he had never seen such a marvel and asked whether it was due to special seed or just good luck. The gardener explained that he was not fortunate, but a poor former soldier who had failed to make a living, so turned to gardening. He mentioned having a wealthy and well-known brother, whereas he himself had been forgotten because of his poverty. Hearing this, the king took pity and promised to change his fortunes, granting him so much wealth—land, gold, and herds—that he outpaced his brother in riches."

I will send you to a third master, but if you learn nothing this time also, I will no longer be your father.’ The youth remained a whole year with the third master also, and when he came home again, and his father inquired: ‘My son, what have you learnt?’ he answered: ‘Dear father, I have this year learnt what the frogs croak.’ Then the father fell into the most furious anger, sprang up, called his people thither, and said: ‘This man is no longer my son, I drive him forth, and command you to take him out into the forest, and kill him.’ They took him forth, but when they should have killed him, they could not do it for pity, and let him go, and they cut the eyes and tongue out of a deer that they might carry them to the old man as a token.",

Exasperated, the father told him, 'Listen, son, no matter how hard I try, I can't teach you anything. You must leave home. I will place you with a renowned teacher, who will attempt to educate you.' The young man was sent to a different town and spent a full year studying with this master. After twelve months, he returned, and his father questioned him, 'Well, son, what have you learned?' The son replied, 'Father, I have learned to understand what dogs say when they bark.' The father exclaimed, 'Good heavens! Is that truly all you've learned? I'll send you to a different town, to another teacher.' The youth was taken there and remained with this second master for another year. Upon his return, his father inquired again, 'My son, what knowledge have you gained?' He answered, 'Father, I have learned what the birds say.' Enraged, the father shouted, 'Oh, you wasted soul, you've squandered precious time learning nothing! Are you not ashamed to even face me? I will send you to a third teacher, but if you fail to learn anything this time as well, I will no longer acknowledge you as my son.' The youth spent a complete year with the third master too, and when he returned home, his father asked, 'My son, what have you learned?' He responded, 'Dear father, this past year I have learned what the frogs croak.' The father exploded in the most furious anger, leaped up, summoned his servants, and declared, 'This individual is no longer my son! I banish him! Take him into the forest and kill him!' The servants led him away, but when they were supposed to kill him, they couldn't bring themselves to do it out of pity. Instead, they let him go, and to provide proof to the old man, they cut out the eyes and tongue of a deer.",

The father, frustrated, told his son that he could not teach him no matter how hard he tried, so he would send him to a renowned teacher to see if he could succeed. The boy went away to study in another town for a year. When he returned, his father asked what he had learned. The son replied that he understood what dogs meant when they barked. The father was dismayed and decided to send the boy to a different town with another teacher. Again, the boy studied a year, then came home. The father questioned him, and the son said he had learned what birds say. The father lost his temper, scolded his son for wasting time, and warned that if he failed to learn something useful after studying with a third teacher, he would disown him. After a third year with yet another teacher, the son returned home. This time, he claimed to have learned the meaning of the frogs' croaking. The father became enraged, called his servants, and declared that the boy was no longer his son, commanding them to take the youth into the forest and kill him. The servants, however, took pity and could not bring themselves to do it. Instead, they released him and took the eyes and tongue of a deer as false proof to show the old count."

The king intervened, agreeing that each brother played a vital role, but since not all could marry her—and as the princess preferred someone else—none of them would marry her.

However, when the prince retired to his room, he asked the chamberlain about the whistling sound from the previous night. The chamberlain confessed everything: giving the prince a sleeping draught, the arrival of a poor maiden who spoke to him in the chamber, and her planned return that evening. The prince then made sure to discard the sleeping potion. When Lily arrived that night and began recounting her hardships and unwavering loyalty, the prince recognized his beloved wife's voice. He instantly awoke, exclaiming, 'You have woken me as if from a dream! The other princess had cast a spell on me, causing me to completely forget you. But Heaven has sent you to me at a fortunate moment.'",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "'Heaven help me now!' she exclaimed. She opened the box that the sun had given to her and discovered a dress inside that shone as brightly as the sun itself. She put on the dress and walked into the palace, drawing everyone's attention. The bride admired the dress so much that she asked if it was for sale. 'Not for money,' she replied, 'but for something living.' When the princess asked what she meant, she answered, 'Let me spend tonight in the bridegroom's chamber, and I will give you the dress.' Eventually, the princess agreed, but instructed her servant to give the prince a sleeping potion so that he would not notice anything. When night fell and the prince was fast asleep, she was led to his room, where she sat at his feet and pleaded: 'I have searched for you for seven years, seeking you from the sun, the moon, and the wind, and I even helped you defeat the dragon. Will you really forget me now?' Yet the prince slept deeply, unmoved by her words, which sounded to him like mere wind in the trees.\n\nSo poor Lily had to leave, surrendering the golden dress. Realizing there was no hope, she sat in a meadow and wept, but then remembered the egg the moon had gifted to her. She broke it open and, out came a golden hen with twelve golden chicks, who played and clustered under the mother hen's wings, making the loveliest sight Lily had ever seen. She drove them along until the bride spotted them and was so taken with the sight that she went to ask if Lily would sell them. Again Lily replied, 'Not for money, but for something living: allow me to speak with the bridegroom in his room tonight and you may have the brood.'\n\nOnce more, the princess planned to deceive her and agreed to the bargain, but this time the prince, suspicious, asked the servant the next day why he had heard wind whistling at night. The servant revealed everything—how he'd given the prince a sleeping potion and how a poor maiden had come to his chamber to speak to him, and that she would return this night. That evening, the prince made sure not to drink the potion. When Lily arrived and described all she had suffered and her loyalty to him, the prince recognized his true wife's voice, jumped up, and exclaimed, 'You have woken me from a slumber—the strange princess enchanted me and made me forget you completely. But Heaven has brought you back to me at last.'"

He begged her for some food, drink, and a place to sleep, saying he would otherwise starve. The witch was skeptical about helping a discharged soldier, but agreed to shelter him if he would do something for her: the next day, he must dig all around her garden. The soldier agreed, but despite his best efforts, could not finish the task in one day. The witch said he'd have to stay another night, and in return, chop firewood for her all the next day. Again he worked the entire day, and in the evening, the witch offered him lodging one more night, saying the next day's job would be simple: behind her house was an old, dry well where her special blue light had fallen. He was to retrieve it for her. The next day, she lowered him down in a basket. He found the blue light and signaled her to pull him up. As he neared the top, the witch reached out greedily to snatch the light from him, but he refused to hand it over until he was safely out of the well. Angered, the witch let him drop back down to the bottom and left him there."

He tapped on the glass pane, and when his comrade approached, he asked, 'Could you please retrieve the small package I left at the inn? I'll give you a ducat for your trouble.' His comrade quickly went and brought back the requested item. Once the soldier was alone again, he lit his pipe and summoned the little black man. The manikin told his master, 'Don't be afraid. Go wherever they lead you and let them do as they wish, but make sure you have the blue light with you.' The next day, the soldier faced trial, and despite having committed no wrong, the judge sentenced him to death. As he was being led out for execution, he requested a final favor from the king. 'What is it?' the king inquired. 'That I might have one last smoke of my pipe on the way,' the soldier replied. 'You may smoke three,' the king agreed, 'but do not think this will save your life.' The soldier then took out his pipe and lit it using the blue light. As soon as a few curls of smoke rose, the manikin appeared, holding a small club, and asked, 'What are my lord's commands?' 'Strike down that dishonest judge and his officer, and show no mercy to the king who has treated me so poorly,' the soldier commanded. The manikin instantly attacked them like lightning, striking here and there. Anyone even slightly touched by his club fell to the ground and did not dare to move. The king was terrified and pleaded for the soldier's mercy. Just to be spared his life, he surrendered his kingdom to the soldier and gave him his daughter's hand in marriage.",

He tapped on the window, and when his companion approached, he asked, 'Would you please fetch the small bundle I left at the inn? I’ll pay you a ducat.' The friend hurried to the inn and brought the bundle. Left alone again, the soldier lit his pipe and called forth the little black man. 'Don’t worry,' the manikin told him. 'Do whatever they ask and go wherever they take you, just make sure to keep the blue light with you.' The following day, despite his innocence, the soldier was put on trial and sentenced to death by the judge. As he was being led to execution, he asked the king for one last request. The king asked what it was, and the soldier replied that he wished to smoke his pipe once more. ‘You may smoke three times,’ the king said, 'but don’t think I’ll spare your life.' The soldier took out his pipe, lit it using the blue light, and as soon as some smoke had drifted up, the little man appeared with a small club and asked, 'What does my master wish?' The soldier ordered, 'Punish the unjust judge, his constable, and show no mercy to the king who wronged me.' Instantly, the manikin sped through the crowd, striking them down with his club, so none dared move again. Overcome by fear, the king begged for mercy and, just for his life to be spared, gave the soldier his kingdom and his daughter’s hand in marriage."

The king had declared that whoever succeeded in making her laugh would be granted her hand in marriage. When Dummling learned of this, he led his goose and its peculiar entourage before the princess. As soon as she saw the line of seven people shuffling along one after another, she erupted into loud laughter that seemed like it would never cease. Dummling then claimed his right to marry her; however, the king was hesitant about this potential son-in-law and devised various excuses. He stated that Dummling must first find a man capable of drinking an entire cellar full of wine. Dummling immediately thought of the small, grey man who could surely help. He went back into the forest and found a man sitting in the exact spot where he had cut the tree, looking very sad. Dummling asked him what was troubling him so deeply. The man replied, saying he had a terrible thirst that he could not satisfy; he couldn't tolerate cold water, and although he had just drained a barrel of wine, it felt to him like a mere drop on a hot stone. \"I can solve that for you,\" said Dummling, \"just come with me, and you will have all you need.\"",

The king had publicly announced that anyone who could get her to laugh would be granted her hand in marriage. On hearing this, Dummling brought his goose and the odd procession following it to appear before the princess. As soon as she saw the seven people trailing one another, she burst out laughing uncontrollably. After this, Dummling asked to marry her, but the king was displeased with him as a potential son-in-law and came up with various objections, saying Dummling must first find someone who could drink an entire cellar of wine. Remembering the little grey man who had helped him before, Dummling went into the forest and found, at the same spot as before, a man who looked very unhappy. Dummling asked what troubled him, and the man replied that he was terribly thirsty, couldn't stomach plain water, and had already drunk a barrel of wine, which barely made a difference. Dummling told the man to come with him, promising to satisfy his thirst."
